In coping and fighting against COVID-19, the most critical step is to effectively screen and diagnose infected patients. Among them, chest X-ray imaging technology is a valuable imaging diagnosis method. The use of computer-aided diagnosis to screen X-ray images of COVID-19 cases can provide experts with auxiliary diagnosis suggestions, which can reduce the burden of experts to a certain extent. In this study, we first used conventional transfer learning methods, using five pre-trained deep learning models, which the Xception model showed a relatively ideal effect, and the diagnostic accuracy reached 96.75%. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we propose an efficient diagnostic method that uses a combination of deep features and machine learning classification. It implements an end-to-end diagnostic model. The proposed method was tested on two datasets and performed exceptionally well on both of them. We first evaluated the model on 1102 chest X-ray images. The experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy of Xception + SVM is as high as 99.33%. Compared with the baseline Xception model, the diagnostic accuracy is improved by 2.58%. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of this model reached 99.27%, 99.38% and 99.32%, respectively. To further illustrate the robustness of our method, we also tested our proposed model on another dataset. Finally also achieved good results. Compared with related research, our proposed method has higher classification accuracy and efficient diagnostic performance. Overall, the proposed method substantially advances the current radiology based methodology, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.","output":"An efficient mixture of deep and machine learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we demonstrate that loss of DRAK2 signaling significantly promotes the acceptance of allogeneic engraftment in two separate transplant models without promoting generalized immunosuppression. Drak2-/- T cells failed to reject allogeneic tumors, and were defective in rejecting Balb/C allogeneic skin grafts on C57BL6/J recipients. A significant fraction of alloreactive Drak2-/- T cells underwent apoptosis following activation, whereas enforced expression of Bcl-xL in Drak2-/- T cells restored allograft rejection. Formation of allogeneic memory was also greatly hampered in T cells lacking the Drak2 gene. Adoptive transfer of memory T cells from Drak2-/- mice failed to promote the rejection of allogeneic tumors, and such cells led to significantly delayed rejection of skin allografts in the Balb/C->C57BL/6J model. Costimulatory blockade by in vivo administration of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) synergized with the DRAK2 deficiency and led to long-term allogeneic skin graft acceptance. Overall, these results demonstrate that DRAK2 plays an important role in primary and memory T cell responsiveness to allografts. Because previous studies have demonstrated that a loss of DRAK2 does not negatively impact antiviral immunity, the studies here underscore the potential utility of pharmacological blockade of DRAK2 to achieve transplant maintenance without the imposition of generalized immunosuppression.","output":"Loss of DRAK2 signaling enhances allogeneic transplant survival by limiting effector and memory T cell responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Aerosol delivery via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has attracted clinical interests in recent years. However, both HFNC and nebulization are categorized as aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). In-vitro studies raised concerns that AGPs had high transmission risk. Very few in-vivo studies examined fugitive aerosols with HFNC and nebulization via HFNC, and effective methods to mitigate aerosol dispersion are unknown.Method: Two HFNC devices (Airvo2 and Vapotherm) with or without a vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) were compared; HFNC alone, surgical mask over HFNC interface, and HFNC with face tent scavenger were used in a random order for nine healthy volunteers. Fugitive aerosol concentrations at sizes of 0.3-10 m were continuously measured by particle sizers placed at one and three feet from participants. On a different day, six of the nine participants received six additional nebulizer treatments via VMN or small volume nebulizer (SVN) with mouthpiece with/without an expiratory filter or facemask. In-vitro simulation was employed to quantify inhaled dose with VMN via Airvo2 and Vapotherm.Results: Compared to baseline, neither HFNC device generated higher aerosol concentrations. Compared to HFNC alone, VMN via Airvo2 generated higher 0.3-1.0 m particles (all p<.05) but VMN via Vapotherm did not. Concentrations of 1.0-3.0 m particles with VMN via Airvo2 were similar with VMN and a mouthpiece/facemask but lower than SVN with a mouthpiece/facemask (all p<.05). Placing a surgical mask over HFNC during nebulization reduced 0.5-1.0 m particles (all p<.05) to levels similar to the use of a nebulizer with mouthpiece and expiratory filter. In-vitro the inhaled dose with VMN via Airvo2 was 6 times higher than VMN via Vapotherm.Conclusion: During aerosol delivery via HFNC, Airvo2 generated higher inhaled dose and consequently higher fugitive aerosols than Vapotherm. Simple measures, such as placing a surgical mask over nasal cannula during nebulization via HFNC, could effectively reduce fugitive aerosol concentrations.","output":"Mitigating Fugitive Aerosols during Aerosol Delivery via High-Flow Nasal Cannula Devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep-learning techniques have led to technological progress in the area of medical imaging segmentation especially in the ultrasound domain.

There is significant variation in weight change after bariatric surgery and much interest in identifying preoperative factors that may contribute to these differences. This report evaluates the associations of a comprehensive set of baseline factors and 3-year weight change. SETTING Ten hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers in the United States. METHODS Adults undergoing a first bariatric surgical procedure as part of clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009. Participants completed research assessments utilizing standardized and detailed data collection on over 100 preoperative and operative parameters for individuals undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Weight was measured 3 years after surgery. Percent weight change for RYGB or LAGB from baseline to 3 years was analyzed as both a continuous and dichotomous outcome with cut points at 25% for RYGB and 10% for LAGB. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to identify independent baseline predictors of the continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. RESULTS The median weight loss 3 years after surgery for RYGB (n = 1513) participants was 31.5% (IQR: 24.6%-38.4%; range, 59.2% loss to .9% gain) of baseline weight and 16.0% (IQR: 8.1%-23.1%; range, 56.1% loss to 12.5% gain) for LAGB (n = 509) participants. The median age was 46 years for RYGB and 48 years for LAGB; 80% of RYGB participants and 75% of LAGB participants were female; and the median baseline body mass index (BMI) was 46 kg/m(2) for RYGB and 44 kg/m(2) for LAGB. For RYGB, black participants lost 2.7% less weight compared with whites and participants with diabetes at baseline had 3.7% less weight loss at year 3 than those without diabetes at baseline. There were small but statistically significant differences in weight change for RYGB in those with abnormal kidney function and current or recent smoking. For LAGB participants, those with a large band circumference had 75% greater odds of experiencing less than 10% weight loss after adjusting for BMI and sex. CONCLUSIONS Few baseline variables were associated with 3-year weight change and the effects were small. These results indicate that baseline variables have limited predictive value for an individual's chance of a successful weight loss outcome after bariatric surgery.

Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19. Methods From 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity, Findings Increased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p=0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p=0.02), with those having normal liver fat (<5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p=0.09). Conclusions UK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity. Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

In polarized cells, different membrane compartments take on specialized roles, each being allocated correct amounts of membrane. The Drosophila tracheal system, an established tubulogenesis model, contains branched terminal cells with subcellular tubes formed by apical plasma membrane invagination. We show that apical endocytosis and late endosome-mediated trafficking are required for membrane allocation to the apical and basal membrane domains. Basal plasma membrane growth stops if endocytosis is blocked, whereas the apical membrane grows excessively. Plasma membrane is initially delivered apically and then continuously endocytosed, together with apical and basal cargo. We describe an organelle carrying markers of late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that is abolished by inhibiting endocytosis and which we suggest acts as transit station for membrane destined to be redistributed both apically and basally. This is based on the observation that disrupting MVB formation prevents growth of both compartments.","output":"Transcytosis via the late endocytic pathway as a cell morphogenetic mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are, besides remdesivir, no approved antivirals for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

However, the safety of VIH in patients with coincident, unruptured, unprotected intracranial aneurysms is uncertain. METHODS This retrospective multiinstitutional study identified 1) patients with aneurysmal SAH and 1 or more unruptured, unprotected aneurysms who required VIH therapy (VIH group), and 2) patients with aneurysmal SAH and 1 or more unruptured, unprotected aneurysms who did not require VIH therapy (non-VIH group). All patients had previously undergone surgical or endovascular treatment for the presumed ruptured aneurysm. Comparisons between the VIH and non-VIH patients were made in terms of the patient characteristics, clinical and radiographic severity of SAH, total number of aneurysms, number of ruptured/unruptured aneurysms, aneurysm location/size, number of unruptured and unprotected aneurysms during VIH, severity of vasospasm, degree of hypervolemia, and degree and duration of VIH therapy. RESULTS For the VIH group (n = 176), 484 aneurysms were diagnosed, 231 aneurysms were treated, and 253 unruptured aneurysms were left unprotected during 1293 total days of VIH therapy (5.12 total years of VIH therapy for unruptured, unprotected aneurysms). For the non-VIH group (n = 73), 207 aneurysms were diagnosed, 93 aneurysms were treated, and 114 unruptured aneurysms were left unprotected. For the VIH and non-VIH groups, the mean sizes of the ruptured (7.2  0.3 vs 7.8  0.6 mm, respectively; p = 0.27) and unruptured (3.4  0.2 vs 3.2  0.2 mm, respectively; p = 0.40) aneurysms did not differ. The authors observed 1 new SAH from a previously unruptured, unprotected aneurysm in each group (1 of 176 vs 1 of 73 patients; p = 0.50). Baseline patient characteristics and comorbidities were similar between groups. While the degree of hypervolemia was similar between the VIH and non-VIH patients (fluid balance over the first 10 days of therapy: 3146.2  296.4 vs 2910.5  450.7 ml, respectively; p = 0.67), VIH resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (mean increase over the first 10 days of therapy relative to baseline: 125.1%  1.0% vs 98.2%  1.2%, respectively; p < 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (125.6%  1.1% vs. 104.1%  5.2%, respectively; p < 0.01).

METHODS The combination of LYT2 and LVS, in addition to a basic skincare routine, was evaluated in subjects of either Caucasian or Asian (a majority of whom were Indian) descent, presenting with moderate to severe hyperpigmentation. Efficacy evaluations consisted of investigator clinical grading of overall hyperpigmentation, skin-tone evenness, and radiance, as well as subject self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS Immediate and progressive improvement was noted by the investigators for all assessed parameters. At the end of the 12-week study, investigators observed a 45% mean decrease from baseline for overall hyperpigmentation. In addition, a 50% improvement in skin tone evenness and a 58% increase in radiance was observed. These investigator assessments were matched by good patient scores for self-perceived efficacy parameters and high overall satisfaction. One patient (7%) showed a treatment-related adverse event.

For drugs that are not clinically significant transporter substrates, it is expected that drug-drug interactions would not result in any changes in volume of distribution. METHODS: An evaluation of this hypothesis proceeded via an extensive analysis of published intravenous metabolic drug-drug interactions, based on clinically recommended index substrates and inhibitors of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. RESULTS: Seventy-two metabolic drug interaction studies were identified where volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) values were available for the CYP index substrates caffeine (CYP1A2), metoprolol (CYP2D6), midazolam (CYP3A4), theophylline (CYP1A2), and tolbutamide (CYP2C9). Changes in exposure (area under the curve) up to 5.1-fold were observed; however, ratios of Vss changes have a range of 0.70-1.26, with one outlier displaying a Vss ratio of 0.57. DISCUSSION: These results support the widely held founding tenant of pharmacokinetics that clearance and Vss are independent parameters. Knowledge that Vss is unchanged in metabolic drug-drug interactions can be helpful in discriminating changes in clearance from changes in bioavailability (F) when only oral dosing data are available, as we have recently demonstrated. As Vss remains unchanged for intravenous metabolic drug-drug interactions, following oral dosing changes in Vss/F will reflect changes in F alone. This estimation of F change can subsequently be utilized to assess changes in clearance alone from calculations of apparent clearance. Utilization of this simple methodology for orally dosed drugs will have a significant impact on how drug-drug interactions are interpreted from drug development and regulatory perspectives.","output":"Volume of Distribution is Unaffected by Metabolic Drug-Drug Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study we argue that parasite-host infections are a major research topic because of their implications for human health, agriculture and wildlife.

We further captured the cardiovascular conditions and diagnostic tools most commonly investigated within this field. METHODS: The Web of Science electronic database was queried to identify relevant papers on digital technology uses in cardiology. Publication and citation data were acquired directly from the database. Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software package, and related to the semantic content of titles, abstracts, and keywords. A term map was constructed for findings visualization. RESULTS: The analysis was based on data from 12,529 papers. Of the top 5 most productive institutions, 4 were based in the United States. The United States was the most productive country (4224/12,529, 33.7%), followed by United Kingdom (1136/12,529, 9.1%), Germany (1067/12,529, 8.5%), China (682/12,529, 5.4%), and Italy (622/12,529, 5.0%).

Here, we present a network model of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread.

We validate the simulation results with the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection in each of these scenarios.","output":"Network model and analysis of the spread of Covid-19 with social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought challenges that sparked a multitude of research questions at the Institutes of Family Medicine in Geneva and Lausanne This article presents a synthesis of these questions, and the research projects that have resulted from them","output":"[Innovating to understand the unknown : COVID-19 pandemic research in family medicine]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This positioning paper is informed by our judgment that the mainstream research on business marketing and marketing in general is losing its relevance and vigor because it views business environments as narrow markets and focuses primarily on dyadic business relationships and their management Sticking to this limited, economics-driven market view has detached the discipline from major real-world phenomena, leaving it with scant understanding of the contemporary environmental context of marketing and business strategy Based on a focused reading of literature on business fields, business networks, business ecosystems, and market systems, we venture our own comprehensive theoretical framing of complex business environments summarized in two frameworks In the pursuit of relevance our integration is avowedly simplifying as we strive for parsimony Key points explicate the nested, multi-layered, multimodal, transitional and conditioned character of the business environment, and the dynamics, phases and processes of the evolution of that nested environment We use the frameworks constructed, which form an initial theory of complex business environments, to supply a research agenda for business marketing and offer brief managerial conclusions","output":"Networks, ecosystems, fields, market systems?

Our results reveal that these ICOS signals critically impacted cell fate decisions of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells, resulting in increased frequencies of KLRG-1(hi)CD127(lo) cells, altered BLIMP-1, T-bet, and eomesodermin expression, and increased cytolytic capacity as compared with empty vector controls. Interestingly, however, ICOS retrogenic CD8(+) T cells also preferentially homed to nonlymphoid organs and exhibited reduced multicytokine functionality and reduced ability to mount secondary recall responses upon challenge in vivo. In sum, our results suggest that an altered differentiation program is induced following early and sustained ICOS expression, resulting in the generation of more cytolyticly potent, terminally differentiated effectors that possess limited capacity for recall response.","output":"Retrogenic ICOS Expression Increases Differentiation of KLRG-1hiCD127loCD8+ T Cells during Listeria Infection and Diminishes Recall Responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developmental research typically relies on face-to-face testing at laboratories, childcare centers, museums or playgroups. Current social distancing measures have led to a halt in research. Although face-to-face interaction is considered essential for research involving young children, current technology provides viable alternatives. This paper introduces an accessible, replicable and easy to follow method to conduct online developmental research with young children employing a word-learning task as an exemplar, including a detailed workflow and step-by-step guide to using easily accessible programs and platforms. Four-year-old children's (N = 56) performance on a word-learning task delivered online vs. face-to-face is provided as a method validation. Children's performance on the word-learning task was predominantly consistent across delivery modes, with only slight variation in performance between modes. The implications of these similar results across face-to-face and online methods are discussed alongside avenues for further research. Importantly, this paper presents an emerging methodological approach for the online administration of developmental science both within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, adding a new tool to current and future developmental scientist's toolkits.","output":"Four-Year-Old's Online Versus Face-to-Face Word Learning via eBooks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This work aimed to identify the mathematical model and ecological pattern of COVID-19 infection and mortality across different countries during the first six months of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: In this pilot study, authors used the online available data sources of randomly selected 18 countries to collect ecological predictors of COVID-19 transmissibility and mortality. The studied determinants were environmental factors (daily average temperature, daily humidity) and socioeconomic attributes (population age structure, count and density, human development index, per capita income (PCI), gross domestic product, internet coverage, mobility trends, chronic diseases). Researchers used the linear and exponential time series analysis, and further utilize multivariate techniques to explain the variance in the monthly exponential growth rates of new cases and deaths. RESULT: In the first two months, the R(2) of linear models for the cases and deaths were higher than that of the corresponding R(2) of the exponential model. Later one, R(2) of the exponential model was occasionally relatively higher than that of the linear models. The exponential growth rate of new cases was significantly associated with mobility trends (=0.00398, P=0.002), temperature (=0.000679, P=0.011), humidity (=0.000249, P=0.000), and the proportion of patients aged above 65 years (=-0.000959, P=0.012). Similarly, the exponential growth rate of deaths was significantly associated with mobility trends (=0.0027, P=0.049), temperature (=0.0014, P<0.001), humidity (=-0.0026, P=0.000), and PCI of countries. During this period, COVID-19 transmissibility was evident to be controlled as soon as social mobility is decreased by about 40% of the baseline over 3 months controlling for the other predictors. CONCLUSION: Controlling of COVID-19 pandemic is based mainly on controlling social mobility. Role of environmental determinants like temperature and humidity was well noticed on disease fatality and transmissibility. COVID-19 contagiousness and fatality were additionally affected by human modifiable risk factors like income and non-modifiable risk factors (ageing) affected.","output":"Pattern of COVID-19 infection and death across countries: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has created a general state of worry and distress, especially among vulnerable groups such as those with psychiatric diagnoses. Worldwide, psychiatric care provision has drastically suffered during the pandemic, with many patients unable to access proper care, which may have implications for increased mental health consequences in patients with psychiatric disorders (e.g., relapse and suicide). This cross-sectional study used structural equation modeling to investigate COVID-19-related trauma and distress among Arab psychiatric population during COVID-19 quarantine. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (N = 168) completed an online survey that comprised the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and a questionnaire on COVID-19-related attitudes/perceptions, sources of information, used protective measures, and socio-demographic information. Respondents commonly reported feeling down-hearted/blue, trouble concentrating, along with symptoms of avoidance and rumination related to the pandemic. Patients with depression and sleep disorders expressed higher COVID-19-related trauma than patients with other disorders. Perceived physical health mediated the effect of co-morbid chronic physical disorders on COVID-19 trauma, psychological distress, perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of recovery in case of contracting COVID-19. Perceived physical health and perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 were strong direct predictors of COVID-19-related trauma and psychological distress. Staying at home negatively predicted COVID-19 trauma and exerted an indirect negative effect on psychological distress via COVID-19 trauma. COVID-19 trauma, age, and marital status directly predicted psychological distress, with COVID-19 trauma being the strongest predictor. Educational level, income, having family members working in the medical field, keeping up to date with the news on deaths/infected cases or the development of COVID-19 drugs or vaccines, satisfaction with available information on COVID-19, and using different protective measures were not associated with significant differences in COVID-19 trauma and psychological distress scores.

Although it is widely recognized that the crystalline structure of a cathode material largely dictates its electrochemical properties (e.g. capacity, cycle life and rate capabilities), this intrinsic connection in LiFePO4 has not been systematically reviewed. Different from the previous reviews, which mainly focus on the improvement of electrochemical performance by all kinds of techniques, in this review, the relationship between its electrochemical performance and bulk/surface structure is reviewed and discussed. First, it is revealed that the intra-particle Li+ transfer is influenced by several properties of the bulk, including crystalline structures, antisite defects and electronic structures. Next, it is demonstrated that the surface/interfacial structures of LiFePO4, which can be reconstructed artificially or spontaneously, also have great impacts on the performances. Lastly, the intrinsic connection between the structure and performance is preliminarily established, showing brand-new perspectives on the strategy for further improvement and contributing to a comprehensive understanding of LiFePO4.","output":"Structure and performance of the LiFePO4 cathode material: from the bulk to the surface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic medical conditions persist for one year or more, require ongoing medical intervention, and impair functioning.

Compared with cells on a flat glass surface, cells on beads with the highest curvature harbored retroviral DNAs at genomic sites near transcriptional start sites and CpG islands during infections at more than 50% higher frequencies. Furthermore, cells on the same type of bead layers contained retroviral DNAs in the genomic regions near cis-regulatory elements at frequencies that were 2.6-fold higher than that of cells on flat glass surfaces. Systems-level genetic network analysis showed that for cells on nanobeads with the highest curvature, the genes that would be affected by cis-regulatory elements near the retroviral integration sites perform biological functions related to chromatin structure and antiviral activities.

PURPOSE To study the effectiveness of combination therapy with RFA and TACE compared to that of TACE alone in a Scandinavian tertiary liver cancer center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of the patients treated with combination therapy vis--vis TACE alone from June 2007 to November 2012 was performed. Eighteen patients were treated with a combination of RFA and TACE with an interval of 1-4 days between the treatments. For comparison, a group of 18 patients treated with TACE as monotherapy in the same time period was matched with the combination group by demographic data, tumor characteristics, biochemical and clinical parameters, and performance status (PS). RESULTS Each group consisted of 14 patients with cirrhosis and four without. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, tumor characteristics, causes of cirrhosis, levels of bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time, Child Pugh score, or World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median survival of patients in the RFA + TACE combination group was 586 days compared to 296 days in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). However, when we stratified the data for cirrhosis and WHO performance status, patients in the combination group had significantly better survival (P = 0.024).

With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time for programs to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviewsall while under the stress of managing the unfolding patient care, financial, and leadership crises of the unfolding pandemic. AIMS: The aim of this survey\\\\based study was to help identify changes compared with previous traditional cycles, obstacles encountered, and program director attitudes toward this, and possible future, virtual application cycles. We separately report the results of an applicant\\\\based survey about the 2020 virtual interview cycle. METHODS: A 50\\\\question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous survey link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors with an invitation for one program leader (either the program director or assistant/associate program director but not both) from each program to complete the voluntary survey. RESULT: Thirty respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 50% based on the 60 ACGME\\\\approved pediatric anesthesiology fellowships. Compared to previous traditional cycles, almost half of respondents (14/29, 48.3%) reported no increase in the number of applications received, and a majority of respondents (16/29, 55.2%) reported that they offered the same number of interview spots for the year. The virtual interview process appears to have gone smoothly, as a majority of programs reported they never or rarely had technical problems across a number of different domains. Importantly, the majority of respondents were either somewhat satisfied or extremely satisfied (21/28, 75%) with the overall virtual interview process. Given the choice of preferred interview format going forward, half of the respondents (14/28) would offer a combination of traditional and virtual interviews. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that virtual interviews are a viable alternative to traditional interviews and can be completed without many technological complications. PDs were overall satisfied with virtual interviews, despite not having appropriate time to plan and coordinate, and would be interested in continuing this option into the future. There are areas where improvements can be made and with appropriate planning could look to mitigate some of the areas where virtual interviews fall short of traditional interviews. In combination with our previously published survey of applicants (Paediatr Anaesth. 2021;31(9):968C976), these data form a more complete picture of virtual interview best practices going forward.","output":"Impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the 2020 pediatric anesthesiology fellowship application cycle: A survey of program directors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and a major health emergency.

We start from a wide prior distribution for the model parameters; then, the ensemble conditioning leads to a posterior ensemble of estimated parameters leading to model predictions in close agreement with the observations. The updated ensemble of model simulations have predictive capabilities and include uncertainty estimates. In particular, we estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time, and we can assess the impact of different intervention measures. By starting from the updated set of model parameters, we can make accurate short-term predictions of the epidemic development given knowledge of the future effective reproductive number. Also, the model system allows for the computation of long-term scenarios of the epidemic under different assumptions. We have applied the model system on data sets from several countries with vastly different developments of the epidemic, and we can accurately model the development of the COVID-19 outbreak in these countries.

The reality could well be that the many of the world's wealthy coastal cities which historically developed as ports will be inundated repeatedly to disappear eventually below the sea, with large swathes of the earth being flooded. Other major conurbations may cease to be liveable without air conditioning, while large numbers of people could well starve as a result of disruption of ecosystems. To the extent that this possibility is recognized, it is nevertheless perceived as a gradual process with the worst results in a distance future with any sea-level rise a gradual process. Limiting emissions is unlikely to be sufficient, because the level of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is now much higher than ever before since humans started to exploit fossil fuels. We know this from the study of ancient air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores. There is a lack of balance between the energy transmitted by the incoming sunlight and the earth's outgoing infrared heat radiation. So far this imbalance is absorbed by the enormous thermal mass of the oceans. As to the speed of sea-level rise, a period of extremely rapid sea-level rise of about 1.4 cm per year has occurred in the prehistoric past and disintegration of ice sheets as is happening currently may well be a plausible explanation of this fact. In fact, it is straightforward to create substantial amounts of negative emissions of carbon dioxide.

Consequently, such physiotherapy sessions declined by 84%. This study investigates the impact of this moratorium on the use of digital remote physiotherapy in Switzerland during this period and the perceptions of its use by Swiss physiotherapists (PTs). METHODS: A cross-sectional online questionnaire was distributed between June and August of 2020 via the Swiss Physiotherapy Association (physioswiss) and various associations of physiotherapy specialists (e.g., sport, pediatric) working in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The questionnaire was designed to capture the demographics of participants and the perceptions of PTs using 33 questions in the following domains: Demography; Attitudes towards digital technology; Private and professional use of digital technology; Use of digital technology during therapy; and, Support requirements. Closed and open-ended questions were included and the frequency of answers was analyzed. Non-parametric inferential statistics were used to identify differences, where appropriate. The Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) was adopted. RESULTS: Participants in the survey were 742 PTs (23.5% male, mean age of 43 years, mean working experience of 18 years) from the German-speaking (75.5%), French-speaking (15.1%), and Italian-speaking (9.4%) regions of Switzerland. The percentage of PTs using digital remote therapy increased from 4.9% prior to the lockdown to 44.6% during the lockdown period. The majority of PTs did not consider that digital remote therapy could complement usual physiotherapy practice and did not plan to continue with digital remote therapy after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, Swiss PTs adopted various low-cost and easily accessible digital technologies. However, several barriers hampered further implementation of this modality. Specific education and training programs need to be provided among PTs, appropriate digital technologies should be introduced, and a correct reimbursement scheme should be developed.

Methods: We identified oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) users from the Integrated Medical Database of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH-iMD), which was linked to the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), from June 2011 to December 2016. A secondary evaluation involved two additional EHR databases. We created consecutive 90-day periods before and after the first recorded OHA prescription and defined patients as having continuous EHR data if there was at least one encounter or prescription in a 90-day interval. EHR data completeness was measured by dividing the number of encounters in the NTUH-iMD by the number of encounters in the NHIRD. We assessed the concordance between EHR and claims data on three clinical outcomes (cardiovascular events, nephropathy-related events, and heart failure admission). We used individual comorbidities that comprised the Charlson comorbidity index to examine the concordance of select baseline comorbidities between EHRs and claims. Results: We identified 39,268 OHA users in the NTUH-iMD. Thirty-one percent (n = 12,296) of these users contributed to the analysis that examined data continuity during the 6-month baseline and 24-month follow-up period; 31% (n = 3,845) of the 12,296 users had continuous data during this 30-month period and EHR data completeness was 52%. The concordance of major cardiovascular events, nephropathy-related events, and heart failure admission was moderate, with the NTU-iMD capturing 49C55% of the outcome events recorded in the NHIRD. The concordance of comorbidities was considerably different between the NTUH-iMD and NHIRD, with an absolute standardized difference >0.1 for most comorbidities examined.

There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. Achieving high-quality semantic searches demands that a document's structural components such as title, section headers, paragraphs, (nested) lists, tables and figures (including their captions) are properly identified. Unfortunately, the PDF format is known to not conserve such structural information because it simply represents a document as a stream of low-level printing commands, in which one or more characters are placed in a bounding box with a particular styling. In this paper, we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F-1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18. This model enhances the capabilities of CCS significantly, as it eliminates the need for human annotated label ground-truth for every unseen document layout. This proved particularly useful when applied to a huge corpus of PDF articles related to COVID-19.","output":"Robust PDF Document Conversion Using Recurrent Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and can be carried by different species of triatomines, including Rhodnius neglectus, which is wild, well distributed in Brazil, and has formed colonies in palm trees located in urban areas of municipalities in the state of S?o Paulo. Chemical control has been routinely used to reduce population density, but each year, there has been an increase in species dispersion and density. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of insects to insecticides used in control. METHODS: The reference population was collected from Ara?atuba municipality, Nilce Maia. Dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied to the back of the first-stage nymphs, which were biologically synchronized. The control group received pure acetone only. Mortality was assessed after 72 h. RESULTS: The mortality rate with respect to diagnostic dose was 100%. The susceptibility profile observed for this population showed RR50 ranging from 1.76 to 3.632. CONCLUSIONS: The populations were susceptible to the insecticides tested. It is possible that the insecticide residual effect on this ecotope has decreased the lifespan, and controlling failures may be the cause of recolonization in this environment.","output":"Monitoring Rhodnius neglectus (Lent, 1954) populations' susceptibility to insecticide used in controlling actions in urban areas northwest of S?o Paulo state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A recombinant baculovirus system has been used to express the amino terminal half of the murine coronavirus (JHMV) peplomer glycoprotein in insect cells.

METHODS: Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis. Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates. RESULTS: There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases. The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys. More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases. The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0-42 days). There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease. The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time. More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province. CONCLUSIONS: Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference. Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection. The distribution of children's COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas.

Focusing on data from England, we investigated prioritization of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximizing averted deaths. We optimized outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order. Vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose favour strategies that prioritize giving more people one dose, although with increasing vaccine supply eventually those eligible and accepting vaccination will receive two doses.

The study focused on the first three stages of the pandemic in Poland, from March to November 2020. Nine weeks of the survey yielded over 1,250 responses. Responses to spatial questions were analysed with GIS tools and geoprocessing algorithms. The number of visitors to green spaces during the pandemic fell to 78.9% of the population, which is down 13.1% compared to before the pandemic. At the same time, the percentage of people refraining from the visits fell with each phase of the crisis. According to the study, residents believed green spaces to be important for their mental and physical health. Over 75% of the participants considered visits to green spaces as having a very big or big impact on stress level reduction.

Current recommendations for healthy food to complement breastfeeding at age 6 to 23 months include iron-rich and iron-enriched foods. An electronic nutrient analysis was undertaken to assess the iron content of hypothetical healthy diets for breastfed babies and young children aged 6 to 23 months in Australia, in comparison with their estimated requirements. METHODS Hypothetical diets for 1 day were developed that were consistent with the Foundation Diets for breastfed infants 6 to 12 months and for toddlers 13 to 23 months. Nutrient content was derived using the Australian Food Composition database in FoodWorks 10. The iron content of these two diets were compared with Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for iron for infants aged 7 to 12 months and children aged 1 to 3 years. RESULTS The iron content of the hypothetical diet for breastfed infants aged 6 to 12 months (5.8 mg) was less than the EAR (7 mg, 83%) and the RDI (11 mg, 53%). For young breastfed children aged 13 to 23 months, the iron content of the hypothetical diet was 4.4 mg; above the EAR (4 mg, 110%) but less than RDI (9 mg, 49%). CONCLUSIONS Breastfeeding has health and neurodevelopmental benefits for infants and young children that are particularly important in remote Australia where food insecurity and poor nutrition compromise health and wellbeing.

Whether these measures proved effective, remains up for discussion. This study aimed at understanding how the behavior of families influenced the probability of acquiring the virus in children with chronic cardiovascular (CV) health conditions. Method: The COVID-19 Child Health Investigation of Latent Disease study screened 6,113 children of less than 18 years in pediatric hospitals and among healthy volunteers in Hamburg from May 9 to June 30, 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal PCR. Of them, 4,657 participants were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The family's social and psychological situation and medical history were assessed via questionnaire. Results: A total of 6,113 (age 7.7  5.1 years) patients were included in the study of which 27.3% had at least one chronic health condition. Also, 219 children (16.2%) had a CV disease. While no active infection on PCR was detected, seropositivity rate amounted to 1.3%. The seropositivity rate did not differ between the population with chronic health conditions and the healthy population (1.0 vs.1.4%, p = 0.271). Parents of children with chronic health conditions more often reported worries regarding the health risk of the virus to their children (30.9 vs. 12.6%, OR = 3.1 [2.7-3.6], p < 0.001) and were less likely to have sent their children to an educational institution 14 days before the testing (48.3 vs. 67.2%, age-adjusted OR = 0.38 [0.33-0.43], p < 0.001). We did not observe increased odds of seropositivity when visiting educational institutions in the 14 days before testing (age-adjusted OR = 1.03 [0.61-1.76], p = 0.902). Increased physical burden of the caregiver and their assessment of their child's worse well-being correlated with increased seropositivity (OR = 2.7 [1.4-5.3], p = 0.004, and 3.3 [1.2-9.5], p = 0.021). Conclusion: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children with and without chronic health conditions is similar. Still, the anxiety in parents of sick children is higher, which leads to a reduced attendance of daycare facilities. Attendance at a daycare facility does not increase the risk of seropositivity in children with health conditions. Caregivers' assessment of the physical well-being in their child is a good predictor of seropositivity.

The aim of the study was to identify critical areas in Brazil for migrants diagnosed with TB and to describe the temporal trend in this phenomenon in recent years. METHODS: This is an ecological study that used spatial analysis and time series analysis. As the study population, all cases of migrants diagnosed with TB from 2014 to 2019 were included, and Brazilian municipalities were considered as the unit of ecological analysis. The Getis-Ord Gi* technique was applied to identify critical areas, and based on the identified clusters, seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL) and Prais-Winsten autoregression were used, respectively, to trace and classify temporal trend in the analyzed series. In addition, several municipal socioeconomic indicators were selected to verify the association between the identified clusters and social vulnerability. RESULTS: 2,471 TB cases were reported in migrants. Gi* analysis showed that areas with spatial association with TB in immigrants coincide with critical areas for TB in the general population (coast of the Southeast and North regions). Four TB clusters were identified in immigrants in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, S?o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, with an upward trend in most of these clusters. The temporal trend in TB in immigrants was classified as increasing in Brazil (+ 60.66% per year [95% CI: 27.21-91.85]) and in the clusters in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Rio de Janeiro (+1.01, +2.15, and + 2.90% per year, respectively).

Here, we aimed to identify clinical factors linked to hospitalization with COVID-19 infection in T2D. Research Design and Methods: We used data from Electronic Medical Record (EHR) registered in the Healthjump database provided by the COVID-19 Research Database consortium. Primary outcomes were to determine clinical factors linked to COVID-19 infection-associated hospitalization. Results: Of 4,445 T2D patients with COVID-19, hospitalization occurred in 228 (5.1%). The risk of Covid-19 infection-related hospitalization was higher with 65years old (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.63), high in patients with a body-mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 (HR 1.59;95% CI, 1.10-2.31), and Blacks than in Caucasians (HR 1.39;95% CI, 1.04-1.85).

The virus specificities of primers were confirmed by using 50 HSV-1, 50 HSV-2, and 8 VZV strains. The assay was performed for 45 min at 65 degrees C. The LAMP assay had a 10-fold higher sensitivity than a PCR assay. An analysis of nucleotide sequence variations in the target and primer regions used for the LAMP assay indicated that 3 of 50 HSV-1 strains had single nucleotide polymorphisms. No HSV-2 or VZV strains had nucleotide polymorphisms. Regardless of the sequence variation, there were no differences in sensitivity with the HSV-1-specific LAMP assay. To evaluate the application of the LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis, we tested clinical samples from 40 genital herpes patients and 20 ocular herpes patients. With the LAMP assay, 41 samples with DNA extraction and 26 direct samples without DNA extraction were identified as positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2, although 37 samples with DNA extraction and just one without DNA extraction were positive by a PCR assay.

METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used to undertake interviews with 45 Royal Melbourne Hospital medical and nursing staff from emergency, intensive care and infectious diseases. Interview questions captured data on HCWs role, familiarity with using protocols, psychological attributes and training for scenarios related to VHF patient management. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Categorical responses were analysed quantitatively and open-ended responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants indicated feeling capable of undertaking their role in managing VHF patients; 77% felt supported through personnel/resources.

The current computational study not only utilizes a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates but also explains (i) why the prescription of chiral drugs was not satisfactory, (ii) what types of modification can make their prescription satisfactory, (iii) the mechanism of action of chiral drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) to block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to human cells, and (iv) the strength of mefloquine to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. As the main protease (M p r o ) of microbes is considered as an effective target for drug design and development, the binding affinities of mefloquine with the M p r o of JC virus and SARS-CoV-2 were calculated, and then compared to know the eliminating strength of mefloquine against SARS-CoV-2. The M p r o of JC virus was taken because mefloquine has already shown a tremendous result of eliminating it from the body. The prescription of a combination of S- (+) -hydroxychloroquine and (+) -mefloquine is considered as a boon by the predicted study. The world is asking for the solution to the upcoming waves of the coronavirus pandemic. The current computational and literature-based prediction expresses the reason for the upcoming waves, and the resolution of it also. Hence, the presented evaluation may play an important role in the current epidemic situation.

Methods The electromyographic response of the upper and lower leg muscles (M. rectus femoris; M. vastus medialis; M. semitendinosus; M. biceps femoris; M. gastrocnemius lateralis) of 15 male patients were measured after an isolated mechanical stimulus of the capsuloligamentous structures during an arthroscopic intervention using a customized intraoperative setup. Target parameters were the short (SLR; <30 milliseconds) and medium latency responses (MLR; >30 milliseconds) after the mechanically-induced trigger. Results The ACL, PCL, LM, and MM displayed high interindividual reproducibility of >76%. The MM was the only structure indicating both an SLR and MLR for all muscles. Although signals could be detected, there was no reproducibility in electromyographic signal activation for the HFP. The most rapid MLR was observed for the PM (quadriceps: 37 milliseconds). Conclusions Each stimulated structure displayed an individual MLR response, which allowed us to create neuromapping combining the anatomical and quantitative representations of the individual muscular activation patterns after isolated mechanical stimulation of the capsuloligamentous knee joint structures, corroborating our hypothesis.

The ORF7a protein has a structural homology with ICAM-1 which binds to the T lymphocyte integrin receptor LFA-1. As COVID-19 has a strong immune component as part of the disease, we sought to determine whether SARS-CoV2 would have a similar structural interaction with LFA-1. Using molecular docking simulations, we found that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a has the key structural determinants required to bind LFA-1 but also the related leukocyte integrin Mac-1, which is also known to be expressed by macrophages. Our study shows that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a protein has a conserved Ig immunoglobulin-like fold containing an integrin binding site that provides a mechanistic hypothesis for SARS-CoV2s interaction with the human immune system. This suggests that experimental investigation of ORF7a-mediated effects on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages (leukocytes) could help understand the disease further and develop effective treatments.","output":"Structural assessment of SARS-CoV2 accessory protein ORF7a predicts LFA-1 and Mac-1 binding potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study was to investigate the quality and reliability of YouTube videos as a source of information in water treatments. We searched videos on YouTube (www.youtube.com) using the following keywords: health resort medicine, spa treatment, spa therapy, hydrotherapy, thermal medicine, balneology, and balneotherapy on June 17th, 2021. The global quality scale (GQS) was used to evaluate the quality of the videos. The assessment of reliability was evaluated using the modified DISCERN tool. Some other video parameters and sources of the videos were also recorded. One hundred twenty-one (121) videos were analyzed. The most common video source was advertisement (46.3%). GQS and modified DISCERN median scores were generally low. They were superior for hydrotherapy and balneotherapy and were also higher in videos uploaded by health-related persons or organizations (physicians, health-related professionals, and health-related websites). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between investigated parameters (like view ratio, number of likes, video power index, video length) and GQS. Only video length was correlated with modified DISCERN for investigated parameters. The median video power index scores were statistically higher for spa therapy and spa treatment. The YouTube content linked with water treatments has poor quality and reliability most of time. The hydrotherapy and balneotherapy keywords have the best quality and reliability. We think that designers of water treatment videos should involve health professionals more often so that the content of their video will better explain the details of medical conditions or interventions.

Many state-of-the-art tools have limited capacity, as they can extract geneCdisease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts. A few studies have explored extracting geneCdisease associations from full-text articles, but there exists a large room for improvements. In this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based RE method, which implements Section Filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract geneCdisease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting geneCdisease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22, 30.30, 29.24 and 23.87% higher than BeFree, DTMiner, BioBERT and RENET, respectively. We applied RENET2 to (i) 1.89M full-text articles from PubMed Central and found 3.72M geneCdisease associations; and (ii) the LitCovid articles and ranked the top 15 proteins associated with COVID-19, supported by recent articles.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection. Since most infected kids were boys in China, there may be sex-dependent immune response in pediatric COVID-19 cases as well.","output":"Sex-dependent immune response and lethality of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quarantine is an important but often misused tool of public health. An effective quarantine requires a process that inspires trust in government, only punishes noncompliance, and promotes a culture of social responsibility. Accomplishing successful quarantine requires incentives and enabling factors, payments, job security, and a tiered enforcement plan. In this article, we examine the variation in state-level quarantine laws and assess the effectiveness of these laws and regulations. We find that most states allow for an individual to have a hearing (63%) and to have a voice in burial and cremation procedures (71%), yet are weak on all other individual rights measures. Only 20% of states have provisions to protect employment when an individual is under quarantine, and less than half have plans for safe and humane quarantines. Decision makers at the state and local levels must make a concerted effort to revise and update quarantine laws and regulations. Ideally, these laws and regulations should be harmonized so as to avoid confusion and disruption between states, and public health officials should work with populations to identify and address the factors that will support successful quarantines if they are ever required.","output":"Raising the Yellow Flag: State Variation in Quarantine Laws."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinicians urgently need reliable and stable tools to predict the severity of COVID-19 infection for hospitalized patients to enhance the utilization of hospital resources and supplies. Published COVID-19 related guidelines are frequently being updated, which impacts its utilization as a stable go-to resource for informing clinical and operational decision-making processes. In addition, many COVID-19 patient-level severity prediction tools that were developed during the early stages of the pandemic failed to perform well in the hospital setting due to many challenges including data availability, model generalization, and clinical validation. This study describes the experience of a large tertiary hospital system network in the Middle East in developing a real-time severity prediction tool that can assist clinicians in matching patients with appropriate levels of needed care for better management of limited health care resources during COVID-19 surges. It also provides a new perspective for predicting patients COVID-19 severity levels at the time of hospital admission using comprehensive data collected during the first year of the pandemic in the hospital.

RASER imaging bursts emerge out of noise and without applying (Radio Frequency) RF pulses when placing spins with sufficient population inversion in a weak magnetic field gradient. A small difference in initial population inversion density creates a stronger image contrast than conventional MRI. This contrast is based on the cooperative nonlinear interaction between all slices. On the other hand, the cooperative nonlinear interaction gives rise to imaging artifacts, such as amplitude distortions and side lobes outside of the imaging domain. Both the contrast and the artifacts are demonstrated experimentally and predicted by simulations based on a proposed theory.

RESULTS: Some structural effects at the neighbourhood level consistently either boost (e.g. population density) or reduce (e.g. income) COVID-19 cases. Other effects differ between the two waves (i.e. age composition, schools and transport infrastructures). CONCLUSIONS: Since certain characteristics influenced the virus diffusion in opposite ways between the two pandemic waves, territorial heterogeneity alone is insufficient to explain COVID-19 outbreaksindividual behaviour also needs to be factored in. Consequently, both econometric and spatial analysis techniques are recommended for tracking the spatiotemporal spread of this disease and for monitoring the effectiveness of policy measures across heterogeneous neighbourhoods.","output":"Do local characteristics act in a similar way for the first two waves of COVID-19?

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearsons correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited peoples movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the new normal standard of life following health guidelines and social distancing.

U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged 12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70). In the random sample, higher overall prevalences were observed among Hispanics and those who reported having a household contact who had previously been told by a health care provider that they had COVID-19.

The team then sought to test the device's efficacy in generating and maintaining negative pressure. The goal proved prescient as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later recommended that all barrier devices use negative pressure. METHODS: Initially, engineers observed simulations of various aerosol\\\\ and droplet\\\\generating procedures using hospital beds and stretchers to determine the optimal working dimensions of the containment device. Several prototypes were made based on these dimensions which were combined with filters and various flow\\\\generating devices. Then, the airflow generated and the pressure differential within the device during simulated patient care were measured, specifically assessing its ability to create a negative pressure environment consistent with standards published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RESULTS: The portable fans were unable to generate any airflow and were dropped from further testing. The vacuums tested were all able to generate a negative pressure environment with the magnitude of pressure differential increasing with the vacuum horsepower. Only the 3.5\\\\horsepower Shop\\\\Vac, however, generated a ?3.0 pascal (Pa) pressure gradient, exceeding the CDC\\\\recommended minimum of ?2.5 Pa for AIIRs.

METHODS: We used electronic medical records (EMR) to obtain data about the total number of the insured population and the number of FMF patients in the two largest health management organizations (HMOs) in Jerusalem, Clalit and Meuhedet. The total number of COVID-19 inpatients at the Hadassah Medical Center, including those with FMF, for the period between the 1 February 2020, and the 10 March 2021 was retrieved from the EMR of Hadassah. COVID-19 course was compared between the FMF inpatient group and age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. Each FMF inpatient was matched with 2 non-FMF controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 between FMF patients and the non-FMF population (0.46% vs 0.41%; p= 0.73).

Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are emerging as critical determinants of both SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and long-term immunity, after either recovery or vaccination. A hallmark of COVID-19 is its highly variable severity and breadth of immune responses between individuals. To address the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon we analyzed the proteolytic processing of S1 spike glycoprotein precursor antigenic peptides across 10 common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), a polymorphic intracellular enzyme that can regulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by generating or destroying antigenic peptides. We utilized a systematic proteomic approach that allows the concurrent analysis of hundreds of trimming reactions in parallel, thus better emulating antigen processing in the cell. While all ERAP1 allotypes were capable of producing optimal ligands for MHC class I molecules, including known SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, they presented significant differences in peptide sequences produced, suggesting allotype-dependent sequence biases. Allotype 10, previously suggested to be enzymatically deficient, was rather found to be functionally distinct from other allotypes. Our findings suggest that common ERAP1 allotypes can be a major source of heterogeneity in antigen processing and through this mechanism contribute to variable immune responses in COVID-19.","output":"Allotypic variation in antigen processing controls antigenic peptide generation from SARS-CoV\\\\2 S1 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fabry disease (FD), like COVID-19, can affect multiple organs, including the lungs.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of host-restricted viral tropism and the potential for transmission of viruses between humans and bats, we exposed a panel of cell lines from bats of diverse species to a prototypical human-origin influenza A virus. All of the tested bat cell lines were susceptible to influenza A virus infection. Experimental evolution of human and avian-like viruses in bat cells resulted in efficient replication and created highly cytopathic variants. Deep sequencing of adapted human influenza A virus revealed a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit not previously described, M285K. Recombinant virus with the PA M285K mutation completely phenocopied the adapted virus. Adaptation of an avian virus-like virus resulted in the canonical PB2 E627K mutation that is required for efficient replication in other mammals. None of the adaptive mutations occurred in the gene for viral hemagglutinin, a gene that frequently acquires changes to recognize host-specific variations in sialic acid receptors. We showed that human influenza A virus uses canonical sialic acid receptors to infect bat cells, even though bat influenza A viruses do not appear to use these receptors for virus entry. Our results demonstrate that bats are unique hosts that select for both a novel mutation and a well-known adaptive mutation in the viral polymerase to support replication. IMPORTANCE Bats constitute well-known reservoirs for viruses that may be transferred into human populations, sometimes with fatal consequences. Influenza A viruses have recently been identified in bats, dramatically expanding the known host range of this virus. Here we investigated the replication of human influenza A virus in bat cell lines and the barriers that the virus faces in this new host. Human influenza A and B viruses infected cells from geographically and evolutionarily diverse New and Old World bats. Viruses mutated during infections in bat cells, resulting in increased replication and cytopathic effects. These mutations were mapped to the viral polymerase and shown to be solely responsible for adaptation to bat cells. Our data suggest that replication of human influenza A viruses in a nonnative host drives the evolution of new variants and may be an important source of genetic diversity.","output":"Influenza A virus polymerase is a site for adaptive changes during experimental evolution in bat cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Construction organizations have been implementing different actions to control and mitigate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their workers and operations.

The pandemic situation resulted in a rapid development of reimbursement for telehealth services. In recent years, evidence on the positive benefits of using telemedicine-based support as part of respiratory therapy follow-up is increasing. It is important to consider patient groups, telemedicine methodology, type of intervention, and targeting criteria in all studies conducted.

This study aimed to calculate the transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to control the disease in Jilin Province, China. METHODS: The data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected, including imported and local cases from Jilin Province as of March 14, 2019. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered/Removed (SEIAR) model was developed to fit the data, and the effective reproduction number (Reff) was calculated at different stages in the province. Finally, the effectiveness of the measures was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 97 COVID-19 infections were reported in Jilin Province, among which 45 were imported infections (including one asymptomatic infection) and 52 were local infections (including three asymptomatic infections). The model fit the reported data well (R2 = 0.593, P < 0.001). The Reff of COVID-19 before and after February 1, 2020 was 1.64 and 0.05, respectively. Without the intervention taken on February 1, 2020, the predicted cases would have reached a peak of 177,011 on October 22, 2020 (284 days from the first case). The projected number of cases until the end of the outbreak (on October 9, 2021) would have been 17,129,367, with a total attack rate of 63.66%. Based on the comparison between the predicted incidence of the model and the actual incidence, the comprehensive intervention measures implemented in Jilin Province on February 1 reduced the incidence of cases by 99.99%. Therefore, according to the current measures and implementation efforts, Jilin Province can achieve good control of the virus's spread. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a moderate transmissibility in Jilin Province, China. The interventions implemented in the province had proven effective; increasing social distancing and a rapid response by the prevention and control system will help control the spread of the disease.","output":"Evaluating the effectiveness of measures to control the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in Jilin Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The fatality rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy is controversial and is greatly affecting discussion on the impact of containment measures that are straining the world's social and economic fabric, such as instigating large-scale isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns.

Coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution, highly infectious, and extremely difficult to control because they have extensive genetic diversity, a short generation time, and a high mutation rate. They can cause respiratory, enteric, and in some cases hepatic and neurological diseases in a wide variety of animals and humans. An enormous, previously unrecognized reservoir of coronaviruses exists among animals. Because coronaviruses have been shown, both experimentally and in nature, to undergo genetic mutations and recombination at a rate similar to that of influenza viruses, it is not surprising that zoonosis and host switching that leads to epidemic diseases have occurred among coronaviruses. Analysis of coronavirus genomic sequence data indicates that SARS-CoV emerged from an animal reservoir. Scientists examining coronavirus isolates from a variety of animals in and around Guangdong Province reported that SARS-CoV has similarities with many different coronaviruses including avian coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-like viruses from a variety of mammals found in live-animal markets. Although a SARS-like coronavirus isolated from a bat is thought to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV, a lack of genomic sequences for the animal coronaviruses has prevented elucidation of the true origin of SARS-CoV. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV shows that the 5' polymerase gene has a mammalian ancestry; whereas the 3' end structural genes (excluding the spike glycoprotein) have an avian origin. Spike glycoprotein, the host cell attachment viral surface protein, was shown to be a mosaic of feline coronavirus and avian coronavirus sequences resulting from a recombination event. Based on phylogenetic analysis designed to elucidate evolutionary links among viruses, SARS-CoV is believed to have branched from the modern Group 2 coronaviruses, suggesting that it evolved relatively rapidly. This is significant because SARS-CoV is likely still circulating in an animal reservoir (or reservoirs) and has the potential to quickly emerge and cause a new epidemic.","output":"The relationship of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus with avian and other coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As an ongoing worldwide health issue, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been causing serious complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure.

We aimed to identify the effects of Nano-curcumin on the modulation of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: Forty COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls were recruited and evaluated for inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion. Subsequently, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: 20 patients receiving Nano-curcumin and 20 patients as the placebo group. The mRNA expression and cytokine secretion levels of IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IL-18 were assessed by Real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULT: Our primary results indicated that the mRNA expression and cytokine secretion of IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and IL-18 were increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy control group. After treatment with Nano-curcumin, a significant decrease in IL-6 expression and secretion in serum and in supernatant (P = 0.0003, 0.0038, and 0.0001, respectively) and IL-1? gene expression and secretion level in serum and supernatant (P = 0.0017, 0.0082, and 0.0041, respectively) was observed.

ADAR1 has two isoforms transcribed from different promoters: ADAR1p150, which is mainly cytoplasmic and interferon-inducible, and constitutively expressed ADAR1p110 that is primarily localized in the nucleus. Mutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi C Goutires syndrome (AGS), a severe autoinflammatory disease in humans associated with aberrant IFN production. In mice, deletion of ADAR1 or selective knockout of the p150 isoform alone leads to embryonic lethality driven by overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes. This phenotype can be rescued by concurrent deletion of cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensor MDA5. These findings indicate that the interferon- inducible p150 isoform is indispensable and cannot be rescued by the ADAR1p110 isoform.

Specifically, conventional statistical reasons to explain poor generalizability such as inadequate model development for the purposes of generalizability, differences in coding of predictors and outcome between development and external datasets, measurement error, inability to measure some predictors, and missing data, all have differing and often complementary treatments, in the two domains.

A tool to predict mortality risk in ventilated patients with COVID-19 could inform decision-making and resource allocation, and allow population-level comparisons across institutions. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 admitted to three tertiary care ICUs in Toronto, Ontario, between 1 March 2020 and 15 December 2020. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify variables predictive of mortality. The primary outcome was the probability of death at three-day intervals from the time of ICU admission (day 0), with risk re-calculation every three days to day 15; the final risk calculation estimated the probability of death at day 15 and beyond. A numerical algorithm was developed from the final model coefficients. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were eligible for inclusion. Median ICU length of stay was 26.9 (interquartile range, 15.4C52.0) days. Overall mortality was 42%. From day 0 to 15, the variables age, temperature, lactate level, ventilation tidal volume, and vasopressor use significantly predicted mortality. Our final clinical risk score had an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 0.9). For every ten-point increase in risk score, the relative increase in the odds of death was approximately 4, with an odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.9).

A number of deep learning-based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis. These approaches, however, suffer from at least one of the following problems: (i) they treat each CT scan slice independently and (ii) the methods are trained and tested with sets of images from the same dataset. Treating the slices independently means that the same patient may appear in the training and test sets at the same time which may produce misleading results. It also raises the question of whether the scans from the same patient should be evaluated as a group or not. Moreover, using a single dataset raises concerns about the generalization of the methods. Different datasets tend to present images of varying quality which may come from different types of CT machines reflecting the conditions of the countries and cities from where they come from. In order to address these two problems, in this work, we propose an Efficient Deep Learning Technique for the screening of COVID-19 with a voting-based approach. In this approach, the images from a given patient are classified as group in a voting system. The approach is tested in the two biggest datasets of COVID-19 CT analysis with a patient-based split.

The cross-dataset analysis has shown that the generalization power of deep learning models is far from acceptable for the task since accuracy drops from 87.68% to 56.16% on the best evaluation scenario. These results highlighted that the methods that aim at COVID-19 detection in CT-images have to improve significantly to be considered as a clinical option and larger and more diverse datasets are needed to evaluate the methods in a realistic scenario.","output":"COVID-19 Detection in CT Images with Deep Learning: A Voting-based Scheme and Cross-Datasets Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a growing concern over the various modes of spread of virus.

Methods: Swab samples were collected from surfaces in Covid-19 wards and laboratory. Sterile premoistened swabs were used to collect samples from high-contact surfaces like door-handles, light-switches, faucet-handles, flushing- buttons, slabs, biosafety-cabinets etc. A total of 48 samples were tested with an RT-PCR test kit, targeting the envelope (E) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. A cycle threshold (Ct) 36 was considered as positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Ct >36 was considered as negative. Results:Among the 48 samples, RT-PCR analysis showed SARS-Cov2 RNA (E-gene positive, RdRp positive) in three sites (6.25%), while six samples (12.5%) were screen-positive (E-gene positive, RdRp negative) despite routine decontamina- tion of the surfaces.

In order to achieve efficient and scalable contact tracing in real time, digital devices can play an important role. While a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk estimation to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people becomes practically impossible but before the fraction of infected people reaches the scale where a lockdown becomes unavoidable), this inference of individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such communication may be encrypted and anonymized, and thus, it is compatible with privacy-preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable of enhancing the performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in the mobile applications.","output":"Epidemic mitigation by statistical inference from contact tracing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus spread across the globe has affected the human life and economies critically On one side, this situation has brought the attention of policymakers to save the mankind, on the other side;this pandemic situation threatened the business across the sphere The firms are worst hit by the virus outbreak and are struggling to survive in this tough phase The objective of this study is to measure the challenges faced by manufacturing and service industry, and how it influenced the financial parameters such as market share, profit margin, and logistics cost, and operating cost of the organization It is also to be observed that in such a crisis, an appropriate strategic plan is required to sustain the businesses Sales, revenue, production, profit margin, raw material availability, in-house employees decreased in manufacturing industries during COVID-19 but no significant change is observed in the service industry Raw material cost, manufacturing cost, logistics cost, and operating cost increased significantly in both manufacturing and services industries Market share, advertising cost, and customer connect decreased in manufacturing industries and increased in services industries The main strategies in crisis are investigated empirically;retrenchment, persevering, innovation, and exit (Wenzel M, Stanske S, Lieberman MB, 2020, Strategic Management Journal, 41, V7?V18), it shows how organizations have taken steps proactively to fight in the crisis of COVID-19","output":"Strategic Responses During Crisis: An Empirical Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Innovative laboratory testing approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed to conduct research to establish estimates of prevalence and incidence. Self-specimen collection methods have been successfully used in HIV and sexually transmitted infection research and can provide a feasible opportunity to scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing for research purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing. To increase participation and minimize bias, epidemiologic research studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response should consider home specimen collection methods.","output":"Willingness to Use Home Collection Methods to Provide Specimens for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Research: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from the young, energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J0537-6910 using data from the second and third observing runs of LIGO and Virgo.

PSR J0537-6910 has the largest spin-down luminosity of any pulsar and is highly active with regards to glitches. Analyses of its long-term and inter-glitch braking indices provided intriguing evidence that its spin-down energy budget may include gravitational-wave emission from a time-varying mass quadrupole moment. Its 62 Hz rotation frequency also puts its possible gravitational-wave emission in the most sensitive band of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Motivated by these considerations, we search for gravitational-wave emission at both once and twice the rotation frequency. We find no signal, however, and report our upper limits. Assuming a rigidly rotating triaxial star, our constraints reach below the gravitational-wave spin-down limit for this star for the first time by more than a factor of two and limit gravitational waves from the $l=m=2$ mode to account for less than 14% of the spin-down energy budget.

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19-positive patient were sex, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and ADT. RESULTS: There were evaluable 9280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in Veneto on 1 April 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT with patients with any other type of cancer (OR 4.86; 95% CI 1.88-12.56). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with non-cancer patients. However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Androgen-deprivation therapies for prostate cancer and risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2: a population-based study (N = 4532)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, iris recognition has been used increasingly as contactless and unaffected by face masks.

Several studies have confirmed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) serves a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. Changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome (GM) cause misfolding and abnormal aggregation of -synuclein (-syn) in the intestine. Abnormal -syn is not eliminated via physiological mechanisms and is transported into the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagus nerve. The abnormal levels of -syn aggregate in the substantia nigra pars compacta, not only leading to the formation of eosinophilic Lewis Bodies in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but also leading to the stimulation of an inflammatory response in the microglia. These pathological changes result in an increase in oxidative stress (OS), which triggers nerve cell apoptosis, a characteristic of PD. This increase in OS further oxidizes and intensifies abnormal aggregation of -syn, eventually forming a positive feedback loop. The present review discusses the abnormal accumulation of -syn in the intestine caused by the GM changes and the increased levels of -syn transport to the CNS via the MGBA, resulting in the loss of DA neurons and an increase in the inflammatory response of microglial cells in the brain of patients with PD. In addition, relevant clinical therapeutic strategies for improving the GM and reducing -syn accumulation to relieve the symptoms and progression of PD are described.","output":"Roles of -synuclein in gastrointestinal microbiome dysbiosis-related Parkinson's disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives COVID-19 infection has been compared to seasonal influenza as an argument against non-pharmacological population based infection control measures known as lockdowns. Our study sought to compare disease severity measures for patients in Ireland hospitalised with COVID-19 against those hospitalised with seasonal influenza. Study Design Retrospective population-based cohort study. Methods COVID-19 hospital episodes and seasonal influenza hospital episodes were identified using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes in the Irish national hospitalisation dataset. Occurrence of key metrics of disease severity, length of stay, intensive care admission, ventilatory support, haemodialysis and in-hospital mortality were measured and compared between the two groups using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, stratified by age. Results Hospitalised COVID-19 episodes had a mean length of stay more than twice as long as hospitalised influenza episodes (17.7 days vs. 8.3 days). The likelihood of all measures of disease severity were greater in COVID-19 episodes, and the odds of in-hospital mortality were five-fold higher in this group compared with seasonal influenza episodes (OR 5.07, 95% C.I. 4.29-5.99, p<0.001).

Several groups have advocated for 1 ventilator to ventilate 2 or more patients in the event of such a shortage. However, differences in patient lung mechanics could make sharing a ventilator detrimental to both patients. Our previous study indicated failure to ventilate in 67% of simulations. The safety problems that must be solved include individual control of tidal volume (VT), individual measurement of VT, individualization of PEEP settings, and individual PEEP measurement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential solutions developed at our institution. METHODS: Two separate lung simulators were ventilated with a modified multiplex circuit using pressure control ventilation. Parameters of the lung models used for simulations (resistance and compliance) were evidence-based from published studies. Individual circuit-modification devices were first evaluated for accuracy. Devices were an adjustable flow diverter valve, a prototype dual volume display, a PEEP valve, and a disposable PEEP display. Then the full modified multiplex circuit was assessed by ventilating 6 pairs of simulated patients with different lung models and attempting to equalize ventilation. Ventilation was considered equalized when VT and end-expiratory lung volume were within 10% for each simulation. RESULTS: The adjustable flow diverter valve allowed volume adjustment to 1 patient without affecting the other. The average error of the dual volume display was -17%. The PEEP valves individualized PEEP, but the PEEP gauge error ranged from 17% to 41%. Using the multiplex circuit, ventilation was equalized regardless of differences in resistance or compliance, reversing the \\"failure modes\\" of our previous study.

Mobile apps are gaining popularity particularly in educational and interventional settings owing to their perceived advantages including support for and engagement of individuals with reading difficulties. In the context of COVID-19, the need for technology-based tools has increased. For practitioners and educators who wish to use apps in their practice or recommend apps to individuals with reading difficulties, it is challenging to identify high-quality apps in app stores. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a systematic search, selection, and appraisal process for tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills. This protocol aimed to (1) provide a systematic method for identifying tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills in the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store and (2) describe an evidence-based approach for quality appraisal of these apps by using structured tools. METHODS: This protocol describes an evidence-based method guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to systematically search, select, and appraise apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills, present in Google Play and the App Store. We intend to perform a systematic and comprehensive search and a 2-step process for screening: (1) broad screening (app titles) and (2) narrow screening (marketing descriptions). Quality appraisal of the included apps will involve two structured appraisal tools: (1) the Mobile Application Rating Scale and (2) the Appraising Apps for Reading Checklist. RESULTS: This method will help determine the number of apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness, present on the Android and iOS platforms. The content, quality, and usability of these apps will be determined using structured appraisal tools. We have planned to conduct searches on Google Play and the App Store in January-March 2021; broad and focused screening, from April 2021; and data extraction and quality appraisal in October 2021.

Kv1.2 expressions in rodent CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) are polarized to distal apical dendrites, and its downregulation specifically enhances dendritic responses to perforant pathway (PP) synaptic inputs. We found that haploinsufficiency of Kv1.2 (Kcna2+/-) in CA3-PCs, but not Kv1.1 (Kcna1+/-), lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) at PP-CA3 synapses, and that the Kcna2+/- mice are normal in discrimination of distinct contexts but impaired in discrimination of similar but slightly distinct contexts. We further examined the neuronal ensembles in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), which represent the two similar contexts using in situ hybridization of immediate early genes, Homer1a and Arc. The size and overlap of CA3 ensembles activated by the first visit to the similar contexts were not different between wild type and Kcna2+/- mice, but these ensemble parameters diverged over training days between genotypes, suggesting that abnormal plastic changes at PP-CA3 synapses of Kcna2+/- mice is responsible for the impaired pattern separation. Unlike CA3, DG ensembles were not different between two genotype mice. The DG ensembles were already separated on the first day, and their overlap did not further evolve. Eventually, the Kcna2+/- mice exhibited larger CA3 ensemble size and overlap upon retrieval of two contexts, compared to wild type or Kcna1+/- mice. These results suggest that sparse LTP at PP-CA3 synapse probably supervised by mossy fiber inputs is essential for gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles.","output":"Gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles associated with contextual discrimination learning is impaired by Kv1.2 insufficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods;however, developing countries in South America had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern Ecuador's response to the novel virus Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) started on February 26, 2020, one month after the outbreak began in China As of today, the countries with more confirmed cases in South America are Brazil and Ecuador Although Brazil has two times the number of cases than Ecuador (Brazil: 700 cases per 100000 people vs Ecuador: 400 cases per 100000), the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the Ecuadorian government Even though there is no cure for COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries","output":"Perspective from Ecuador, the Second Country with More Confirmed Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in South America: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: This study aims to determine whether baseline vitamin D status in newly admitted COVID-19 patients is associated with a severe disease course and mortality. Methods: This retrospective study included newly admitted RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 adult patients with baseline serum vitamin D (VitD) levels from April to September 2020. Suboptimal VitD was defined by 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels based on current guidelines as: VitD insufficiency is equal to or more than 20ng/ml to 30ng/ml and VitD deficiency is less than 20ng/ml with a severely deficient subgroup defined as less than 12ng/ml. Classification of COVID-19 infection was based on CDC criteria and severe disease course were those that belong to the severe and critical categories of COVID-19 classification or those who had any need for respiratory support and/or critical care treatment at any point from admission to discharge. Mortality is based on designated disposition of death from any cause upon discharge. Severe disease course and disposition of death upon discharge were defined in each VitD status group. Data analysis was applied to measure associations of baseline VitD status in COVID-19 patients with outcomes C severe disease course and death. Results: A total of 192 newly admitted COVID-19 patients (mean [SD]age,61.33[16.22] years;101[52.6%] men, 91[47.4%] women;and 106 [55.2%] 65 years and above had baseline VitD level measured upon admission. VitD status of the patients was categorized as sufficient - 39 patients (20.31%), insufficient - 81 patients (42.19%) and deficient - 72 patients (37.5%) with a severely deficient subgroup - 11 patients (5.73%). Overall, majority of patients C 79.69% had suboptimal VitD levels of less than 30ng/ml. When each VitD status group was considered, the VitD deficient group had the greatest number of patients that had a severe disease course at 69.44% and even a higher rate of 81.82% in the severely deficient subgroup. Similarly, most of the patients (80%) with death as outcome did not have VitD levels within the normal range, where 40% of those who died were VitD insufficient and 40% were VitD deficient. When each VitD status was considered, highest rate of death was seen in the VitD deficient group at 22.22% with a higher rate of 36.36% noted in the severely deficient subgroup. When both outcomes were considered, the highest rate of mortality among those that had a severe disease course was in the severely deficient subgroup at 44%. Overall calculations regarding the associations of being not sufficient in baseline vitamin D levels with a severe disease course (P=0.830) and mortality (P=0.956) in newly admitted COVID-19 patients did not reach statistical significance when compared to the vitamin D sufficient group. However, when each VitD status group was analyzed, an increasing gradient was noted with a strongest correlation seen in the severely deficient subgroup and both outcomes C severe disease course (insufficient P=0.714;deficient P=0.562;severely deficient P=0.210) and death (insufficient P=1.00;deficient P=0.785;severely deficient P=0.690). Conclusion: In this single-center, retrospective study, baseline VitD insufficient status and VitD deficient status were not associated with increased risk for a severe COVID-19 disease course and death. Findings of suboptimal baseline VitD levels in the majority of patients suggests, that rational VitD supplementation in COVID-19 patients to achieve normal levels may be beneficial given its general safety and cost. Randomized trials and a larger population size are recommended to further elucidate the potential associations of VitD levels and COVID-19 outcomes observed in this study.

Alternatively, nasal swab (NS) or saliva swab (SS) specimens are used, although available data on test accuracy are limited. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of NPS/NS/SS samples for this purpose. METHODS: Ten patients were included after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NPS samples according to the National Institute of Infectious Disease guidelines. In comparison with this conventional diagnostic method, NPS/NS/SS samples were tested using the cobas 6800 systems RT-PCR device. To investigate the usefulness of the cobas method and the difference among sample types, the agreement and sensitivity were calculated. Five to six samples were collected over a total period of 5-6 d from each patient. RESULTS: Fifty-seven sets of NPS/NS/SS samples were collected, of which 40 tested positive for COVID-19 by the conventional method. Overall, the concordance rates using the conventional method were 86.0%/70.2%/54.4% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas); however, for samples collected up to and including on Day 9 after disease onset (22 negative and one positive specimens), the corresponding rates were 95.7%/87.0%/65.2%. The overall sensitivity estimates were 100.0%/67.5%/37.5% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas). For samples up to 9 d after onset, the corresponding values were 100.0%/86.4%/63.6%.

To resolve the abrupt overloading of COVID-19Csuspected patients in a community, each ED needs to respond in various ways. In our hospital, we increased the isolation beds through temporary remodeling and by performing in-hospital COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing rather than outsourcing them. The aim of this study was to verify the effects of our response to the newly developed viral outbreak. The medical records of patients who presented to an ED were analyzed retrospectively. We divided the study period into 3: pre-COVID-19, transition period of response (the period before fully implementing the response measures), and post-response (the period after complete response). We compared the parameters of the National Emergency Department Information System and information about isolation and COVID-19. The number of daily ED patients was 86.8  15.4 in the pre-COVID-19, 36.3  13.6 in the transition period, and 67.2  10.0 in the post-response period (P < .001). The lengths of stay in the ED were significantly higher in transition period than in the other periods [pre-COVID-19 period, 219.0 (121.0C378.0) min; transition period, 301 (150.0C766.5) min; post-response period, 281.0 (114.0C575.0) min; P < .001].

On February 27, 2020, the first patient with coronavirus was diagnosed in Israel. On March 14, 2020, the Israeli government declared a general lockdown that lasted about a month, which altered the lives of the entire population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the change in the well-being, physical activity, and sleep quality of undergraduate students of education at 2 time points: before (November 2019) and during (April 2020) the first COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: In total, 533 undergraduate students of education submitted an online questionnaire before the lockdown and at its end. The questionnaire comprised 4 parts: a (1) sociodemographic and (2) weekly exercise questionnaire taken from the International Physical Activity QuestionnaireCShort Form; (3) sleep quality, rated using the Mini Sleep Questionnaire; and (4) well-being, rated using the short version of the Mental Health Inventory. This was a pre-post prospective cohort questionnaire study. RESULTS: It was predicted that there would be a decrease in the aforementioned parameters. Contrary to all expectations, an increase was observed in all 3. Results showed that during the lockdown, there was an increase in the level of exercise students engaged in. Overall, 102 (61.4%) of 166 students engaged in a greater amount of physical activity during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to 150 (40.9%) of 367 students who engaged in a greater amount of physical activity before COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these existing issues in a vulnerable, often forgotten, immigrant community. It has been challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information has seldom been disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese. While long-term solutions will require time and changes to policy, some short-term measures can mitigate the current situation. The authors share their experience from Newark, New Jersey, where partnerships of public and private community-based organizations (CBOs) have been successful in establishing trust between the health care system and a fearful Latino community.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of reports assessing the association between thrombosis and the prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The EMBASE, Ovid-MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to December 9, 2021, and additional studies were retrieved via manual searching. Studies were included if they reported the risk of COVID-19-related critical status or COVID-19-related mortality in relation to thrombosis. The related data were extracted by two authors independently, and a random effects model was conducted to pool the odds ratios (ORs). In addition, stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate the association. RESULTS: Among 6,686 initially identified studies, we included 25 studies published in 2020 and 2021, with a total of 332,915 patients according to predefined inclusion criteria. The associations between thrombosis and COVID-19-related mortality and COVID-19-related critical status were significant, with ORs of 2.61 (95% CI, 1.91C3.55, p < 0.05) and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.6C5.24, p < 0.05), respectively.

The present research investigates peoples intention to adopt medical AI as well as the drivers of this adoption in a representative study of two European countries (Denmark and France, N = 1068) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results reveal AI aversion; only 1 of 10 individuals choose medical AI over human physicians in a hypothetical triage-phase of COVID-19 pre-hospital entrance. Key predictors of medical AI adoption are peoples trust in medical AI and, to a lesser extent, the trait of open-mindedness. More importantly, our results reveal that mistrust and perceived uniqueness neglect from human physicians, as well as a lack of social belonging significantly increase peoples medical AI adoption. These results suggest that for medical AI to be widely adopted, people may need to express less confidence in human physicians and to even feel disconnected from humanity. We discuss the social implications of these findings and propose that successful medical AI adoption policy should focus on trust building measuresCwithout eroding trust in human physicians.","output":"Drivers and social implications of Artificial Intelligence adoption in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faeces are not always uniform in consistency.

Because wearing a mask mixes expired air with the subject's inspired air stream, the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide [CO2] is elevated, resulting in mild hypercapnia. Changes in the inspired gas mixture have been demonstrated to alter R2*-weighted Blood Oxygen Dependent (BOLD) contrast. In this study, we investigate a potential for face masking to alter BOLD contrast during a sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in 8 subjects. We utilize a nasal cannula to supply air to the subject wearing a surgical mask in on-off blocks of 90s to displace expired CO2, while the subject performs the sensory-motor task. While only a small fraction (2.5%) of the sensory-motor task activation is related to nasal air modulation, a 30.0% change in gray matter BOLD signal baseline is found due to air modulation. Repeating the scan with mask removed produces a small subject-specific bias in BOLD baseline signal from nasal air supply, which may be due to cognitive influence of airflow or cannula-induced hypoxia. Measurements with capnography demonstrate wearing a mask induces an average increase in ETCO2 of 7.4%. Altogether, these results demonstrate that wearing a face mask during gradient-echo fMRI can alter BOLD baseline signal but minimally affects task activation.","output":"Effect of Wearing a Face Mask on fMRI BOLD Contrast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intracranial aneurysm treatment with flow diverters has shown satisfying results in terms of aneurysm occlusion, and while some cases of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage have been described, no systematic analysis of the risk factors affecting its occurrence has been conducted in a large series of patients. This retrospective analysis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage after flow-diverter treatment is a multicenter, retrospective study using a large series of treated patients to analyze factors affecting the occurrence of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters and presenting with delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage were included from December 2007 to December 2014 in 7 participating centers in France. Patient and aneurysm characteristics were recorded as were characteristics of bleeding (size, lateralization, and time to bleed), treatment, and clinical outcome after 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS Delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurred in 11 patients between 1 and 21 days after the procedure. In 10 of these patients, hemorrhages were ipsilateral to the treated aneurysms. Five of the 11 underwent surgery, and 9 of the 11 had good clinical outcomes at 6 months (mRS 2). CONCLUSIONS The pathogenesis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurring after flow-diverter treatment remains unclear. The multidisciplinary management of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage yields a relatively low morbidity-mortality rate compared with the initial clinical presentation.","output":"Retrospective Analysis of Delayed Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage after Flow-Diverter Treatment: Presentation of a Retrospective Multicenter Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection, which can lead to pneumonia, lung injury, and death in susceptible populations. Understanding viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for development of effective treatments. An Immune-Viral Dynamics Model (IVDM) is developed to describe SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and COVID-19 disease progression. A dataset of 60 individual patients with COVID-19 with clinical viral load (VL) and reported disease severity were assembled from literature. Viral infection and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, viral-induced cell death, and time-dependent immune response are incorporated in the model to describe the dynamics of viruses and immune response. Disease severity are tested as a covariate to model parameters. The IVDM was fitted to the data and parameters were estimated using the nonlinear mixed-effect model. The model can adequately describe individual viral dynamics profiles, with disease severity identified as a covariate on infected cell death rate. The modeling suggested that it takes about 32.6 days to reach 50% of maximum cell-based immunity. Simulations based on virtual populations suggested a typical mild case reaches VL limit of detection (LOD) by 13 days with no treatment, a moderate case by 17 days, and a severe case by 41 days. Simulations were used to explore hypothetical treatments with different initiation time, disease severity, and drug effects to demonstrate the usefulness of such modeling in informing decisions. Overall, the IVDM modeling and simulation platform enables simulations for viral dynamics and treatment efficacy and can be used to aid in clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose-efficacy response analysis for COVID-19 drug development.","output":"Immune-viral dynamics modeling for SARS-CoV-2 drug development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging health problem around the world. At time of this study, the pandemic is still underway, so prevention and control are of great importance. This review provides a comprehensive examination and analysis of the literature related to the challenges of controlling COVID-19. Methods: In this narrative review study, the search was performed on international databases including PubMed, Scopus and Embase, using relevant keywords. The resulting articles and texts were reviewed and screened, and then the relevant information was extracted. Results: The number of patients who are thought to have contracted COVID-19 is much higher than that in the SARS and MERS epidemics. Despite a lower mortality rate, COVID-19 has caused more deaths. One of the challenges that have made the control of the disease more difficult include the emergence of multiple viral mutations. In this review, it was found that the best course of action comprises continuous monitoring of disease-related indicators as part of a series of measures taken together to ensure their effectiveness. Conclusion: It is recommended that governments should form international partnerships in their efforts to overcome the pandemic, and that preventive and control measures should be taken simultaneously. ? 2021 Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

Design: observational cohort study. Setting: large Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability. Participants: patients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation. Main outcome measures: care escalation rates, including hospital admission. Results: between 11-29 March 2020, 162/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management.

In response, we investigated the interactions between autophagy and DTMUV, the effects of the structural and non-structural proteins of DTMUV on autophagy, and the autophagy-related signaling pathways induced by DTMUV. Among the results, DTMUV increased the autophagy flux in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) and BHK-21 cells, while autophagy facilitated viral replication. After we pharmacologically induced autophagy with rapamycin (RAPA), the replication of DTMUV increased by 15.23-fold compared with the control group of DEF cells. To identify which DTMUV protein primarily induced autophagy, all three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins of DTMUV were transfected into cells, and the results showed that non-structural protein 3 (NS3) induced significant autophagy in DEF cells. By means of Western blot, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy, we confirmed that NS3 protein could significantly induce autophagy and autophagy flux. Furthermore, we showed that NS3 induced autophagy in DEF cells through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways using specific inhibitors and RNA interference assays. Finally, autophagy induced by NS3 promoted DTMUV replication.

Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus. Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence.

However, the spikes in concentrations of these indicator organisms in the river did not necessarily coincide with the spikes in the levels of total coliforms and E. coli detected in samples collected on the same dates in Soufriere Bay, indicating that there are other sources of pollution in the Bay besides discharges from the river. Monitoring for chemical indicators of wastewater (i.e., caffeine, sucralose, fluconazole) in the Soufriere River indicated that there are inputs of sewage or human fecal material throughout the watershed.

Very often, there is a significant discrepancy between the building energy performance predicted at the design stage and the actual performance rendered during the building operation. This stems from the difference in user occupancy. In spite of this, user interaction and feedback are rarely taken into account and evidence of the impact of occupant presence patterns on energy consumption is still scarce. Thus, the purpose of this study is to apply crowd-sensing techniques to understand how energy is consumed and how appropriate performance indicators should be defined to provide inputs for building operations regarding more efficient use of resources. METHODS: Monitoring strategies were implemented in an office lab with controlled variables to collect quantitative data on occupancy patterns, ambient factors and energy consumption. In addition, crowd-sensing techniques were applied to model user activity in different ambient conditions over time and to contrast their occupancy with energy consumption patterns in combination with new inquiry tools to identify how occupants perceive their comfort level. In addition, a set of energy efficiency indicators was used to compare energy performance over different periods. RESULTS: It was discovered that there is a strong relation between user occupancy patterns and energy consumption. However, more than 50% of energy was consumed when no user activity was registered. Energy performance indicators revealed that measuring energy efficiency in terms of kWh per surface area encourages a less efficient use of space and, therefore, including a coefficient of person hours is advisable. It was also discovered that users do not fully rely on feedback mechanisms and they prefer to take action to adapt the ambient conditions rather than simply expressing their opinion. Analysis of energy usage during the Covid-19 lock down revealed substantial use of energy contrary to what was expected. This was because home computers were used as terminals only, while the actual tasks were performed on the lab computers, using remote desktop connections, which were turned on 24/7.

DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective study at the Massachusetts General Hospital from June 2015 to June 2019. PATIENTS: All patients with obesity and acute respiratory distress syndrome who were referred for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation evaluation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. INTERVENTION: Evaluation and individualized optimization of mechanical ventilation by the lung rescue team before the decision to proceed with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The control group was those patients managed according to hospital standard of care without lung rescue team evaluation. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: All 20 patients (100%) allocated in the control group received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, whereas 10 of 13 patients (77%) evaluated by the lung rescue team did not receive venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients who underwent lung rescue team evaluation had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.03) and shorter ICU length of stay (p = 0.03). There were no differences between groups in in-hospital, 30-day, or 1Cyear mortality.

Aim Hence, this narrative review aims to provide critical insight for reviving the heterologous prime\\\\boost immunization strategy for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination relative to a brief positive outlook on the mix\\\\dose approach deployed in previous and existing outbreaks (ie, Ebola virus disease (EVD), malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, HIV and influenza virus). Methodology and Materials A Boolean search was carried out to find the literature in MEDLINE\\\\PubMed, Clinicaltrials, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases up till December 22, 2021, using the specific keywords that include SARS\\\\CoV2, COVID\\\\19, Ebola, Malaria, Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B, Influenza, Mix and match, Heterologous prime\\\\boost, with interposition of OR and AND.

Results Therefore, as generally evident by the primary outcomes, that is, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity reported and updated by preclinical and clinical studies for addressing previous and existing outbreaks so far, including COVID\\\\19, it is understood that heterologous prime\\\\boost immunization has been proven successful for eliciting a more efficacious immune response as of yet in comparison to the traditional homologous prime\\\\boost immunization regimen. Discussion Accordingly, with increasing cases of COVID\\\\19, many countries such as Germany, Pakistan, Canada, Thailand, and the United Kingdom have started administering the heterologous vaccination as the technique aids to rationalize the usage of the available vaccines to aid in the global race to vaccinate majority to curb the spread of COVID\\\\19 efficiently.

In this study, metallic coatings were applied on porous polyethylene substrates using a twin wire-arc spray process. Commercially available polyethylene sheets, 3 mm in thickness, were used as substrates. Copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) were successfully deposited on the porous polymer, without prior surface preparation, to form coatings with thickness of about 400 m. Coating surface morphology and cross-sections were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Individual metal splats on the porous and non-porous substrates were observed to study the differences in the bonding mechanisms. The adhesion strength and electrical resistivity of the coatings on porous PE were evaluated. It was found that the bond strength of all three metallic coatings was found to be higher than the ultimate fracture strength of the porous. These results suggest that porosity in the polymer helps to overcome the challenges of metallizing polyethylene and provides a significant reduction in the weight of the polymer. Therefore, all these properties aided in fabricating an extremely lightweight, composite material with potential use in thermal management applications.","output":"Metallization of Porous Polyethylene Using a Wire-Arc Spray Process for Heat Transfer Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The US risdiplam expanded access program (EAP; NCT04256265) was opened to provide individuals with Type 1 or 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who had no satisfactory treatment options access to risdiplam prior to commercial availability. The program was designed to collect safety data during risdiplam treatment. METHODS: Patients were enrolled from 23 non-preselected sites across 17 states and treated with risdiplam orally once daily. Eligible patients had a 5q autosomal recessive Type 1 or 2 SMA diagnosis, were aged 2 months at enrollment, and were ineligible for available and approved SMA treatments or could not continue treatment due to a medical condition, lack/loss of efficacy, or the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 155 patients with Type 1 (n = 73; 47.1%) or 2 SMA (n = 82; 52.9%) were enrolled and 149 patients (96.1%) completed the EAP (defined as obtaining access to commercial risdiplam, if desired). The median treatment duration was 4.8 months (range, 0.3-9.2 months). The median patient age was 11 years (range, 0-50 years), and most patients (n = 121; 78%) were previously treated with a disease-modifying therapy.

It has occurred widespread medical courses suspension, and graduations were anticipated. Field hospitals, set up to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, were the main workplaces of newly graduated doctors. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of medical interns and newly graduated doctors. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study performed using a digital platform. Links to forms were sent in two moments: moment 1 (M1), at the beginning of the pandemic, in the first half of April/2020 and moment 2 (M2), after six months of pandemic, in the second half of September/2020. All students from the medical internship and all doctors graduated since 2018 from the three medical schools in Sergipe-NE-Brazil were invited. RESULTS: 335 forms were answered in April and 148 in September. In M1 88.9% considered themselves exposed to excess of information about COVID-19, which was associated with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.04). Long family physical distance was also associated with these symptoms, as increased appetite (p = 0.01), feeling shortness of breath (p = 0.003) and sweating (p = 0.007). Fear of acquire COVID-19 was reported as intense by almost half of participants, and of transmitting by 85.7% in M1. In M2 41.2% reported the death of friends or relatives. Psychiatric illness was described by 38.5% and psychotropic drugs use by 30.1% in M1, especially those who lived alone (p = 0.03) and the single ones (p = 0.01).

In pts >60 years (y), early prediction for adverse outcome is central to adopt therapeutic strategies to mitigate mortality. Multiorgan, but specifically, respiratory failure is associated with aging and known comorbid conditions [i.e obesity, cardiovascular disease]. Previous reports suggest that innate immunity effectors [i.e neutrophils and lymphocytes] readapt during acute infection. During acute COVID-19 infection, neutrophilia/lymphopenia are linked to deregulated cytokines, a phenomenon that seems to be associate with disease severity. In this study, we seek to investigate the predictive role of peripheral blood count modifications [absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte (AMC) counts], in risk evaluation for life-threatening COVID-19 among elderly pts. Methods: After IRB approval, 104 pts admitted at Baylor St Lukes Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 PCR between April-June 2020 were selected for analysis. 66/104 (63.4%) pts were older than 60 y. In elderly pts, disease severity was estimated according to the World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China guidelines (mild vs severe vs life-threatening). To detect at diagnosis differential ANC, ALC and AMC expression, cases were categorized into mild/severe (censor=0) vs life-threatening (censor=1). Students t-test and chi-square analysis for continuous and categorical variables were performed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis including: (1) Hemopoietic factors [ANC, ALC, AMC] and (2) comorbid/inflammatory [CRP, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score] were obtained. SAS software was used for analysis. Results: 27/66 (40.9%) and 39/66 (50.09%) pts were mild/severe vs life-threatening COVID-19 disease. For mild/severe vs life-threatening disease, median age, BMI, Charlson comorbid score, were 68 vs 71 y, p=0.78; 27.7 vs 30, p=0.09; 5.40 vs 5.69, p=0.68, respectively. ANC, ALC, AMC, IL6 and CRP were 3.98 K/UL vs 6.79 K/uL, p=0.008; 0.90 K/UL vs 0.66 K/uL, p=0.01; 0.54 K/uL vs 0.43 K/uL, p=0.01; 43.2 vs 187.3, p=0.02; 10.1 vs 17.8, p=0.0001, for patients with mild/severe vs life-threatening disease (Fig 1). On univariate analysis, predictive variables for life-threatening disease were higher ANC (OR=1.24[1.02-1.49], p=0.02); lower ALC (OR=0.21[0.05-0.8], p=0.02), lower AMC (OR=0.11[0.01-0.86], p=0.03), and higher CRP (OR=1.19 [1.07-1.32], p=0.001). In multivariate analysis considering hemopoietic parameters, higher ANC (OR=1.53 [1.17-2.01], p=0.001) and lower AMC (OR=0.01 [0.001-0.28], p=0.006) retained predictive value. Detectable evidence at diagnosis for higher ANC, low AMC and ALC (3/3 hemopoietic factors) was discriminative for life-threatening COVID-19 disease (3 vs those with <3 factors, 100% vs 50%. Likelihood ratio= 7.73, p=0.01). A cutoff of 5.58 K/UL, 0.22 K/uL, 0.66 K/uL were associated severity prediction with sensitivity of 73.6%, 76.3%, 81.4% for ANC, AMC and ALC, respectively. Conclusions: In elderly COVID-19 pts exhibiting elevated CRP, a combination of high ANC, low monocyte and lymphocyte count is predictive for adverse COVID-19 outcome. Recent evidence suggests that monocytes redistribute from peripheral blood into the lungs to participate in tissue injury. Our data suggests that neutrophils/monocytes/lymphocytes induce differential early signature with ability for prediction of life-threatening disease. This signature may assist in identifying pts necessitating risk-adaptive interventions such as steroids, biologic agents and/or novel anti-inflammatory strategies.

A potential alternative is phage therapy, in which phages infect and lyse the bacterial host. However, phage therapy poses serious drawbacks and safety concerns, such as the risk of genetic transduction of antibiotic resistance genes, inconsistent pharmacokinetics, and unknown evolutionary potential. In contrast, metallic nanoparticles possess precise, tunable properties, including efficient conversion of electronic excitation into heat. In this work, we demonstrate that engineered phage-nanomaterial conjugates that target the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are highly effective as a treatment of infected wounds in mice. Photothermal heating, performed as a single treatment (15 min) or as two treatments on consecutive days, rapidly reduced the bacterial load and released Zn(2+) to promote wound healing. The phage-nanomaterial treatment was significantly more effective than systemic standard-of-care antibiotics, with a >10 greater reduction in bacterial load and 3 faster healing as measured by wound size reduction when compared to fluoroquinolone treatment. Notably, the phage-nanomaterial was also effective against a P. aeruginosa strain resistant to polymyxins, a last-line antibiotic therapy. Unlike these antibiotics, the phage-nanomaterial showed no detectable toxicity or systemic effects in mice, consistent with the short duration and localized nature of phage-nanomaterial treatment.

Testosterone exhibits an immunosuppressive effect, and androgens play a modulatory role on protease enzymes. It is known that various comorbidities, including obesity; pregnancy; diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); hypertension; cancer; chronic kidney, liver, and lung diseases; cerebrovascular disease; heart conditions; human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunologic disease; and immune suppression; affect the severity of COVID-19 infection.

Supervised principal components analysis was used to build a weighted gene expression risk score (WGERS) to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in participants with mild and moderate illness were similar, but significantly different from severe illness. When comparing severe versus non-severe illness, we identified >4000 genes differentially expressed (FDR<0.05).

However, the rather slow biomolecular binding events often present challenges for conventional MD (cMD), due to limited simulation timescales (typically over hundreds of nanoseconds to tens of microseconds). In this regard, enhanced sampling methods, particularly accelerated MD (aMD), have proven useful to bridge the gap and enable all-atom simulations of biomolecular binding events. Here, we will review the recent method developments of Gaussian aMD (GaMD), ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD), which have greatly expanded our capabilities to simulate biomolecular binding processes. Spontaneous binding of various biomolecules to their receptors has been successfully simulated by GaMD. Microsecond LiGaMD and Pep-GaMD simulations have captured repetitive binding and dissociation of small-molecule ligands and highly flexible peptides, and thus enabled ligand/peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics calculations.

METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs' perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients' main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored using descriptive statistics, diagrams, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 1237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Among these, 1000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (1000/1237; 81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic.

In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% (1011/1785) of cases, as opposed to 32% (87/274) when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61% (1165/1919), compared to 35% (544/1556) for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, and administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, nonpandemic setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear future role for VCs in nonpandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs' perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","output":"Suitability of Video Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: Cross-sectional Survey Among Norwegian General Practitioners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is controlled by complex mechanisms. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of PD-L1 expression is important for the exploration of new insights into PD-1 blockade therapy. Detailed mechanisms of the in situ expression of PD-L1 in tissues of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) have not yet been clarified. We examined the mechanisms of PD-L1 expression focusing on the phosphorylation of downstream molecules of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon gamma (IFN-?3) signaling in vitro and in vivo by immunoblotting and multi-fluorescence immunohistochemistry (MF-IHC), respectively. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that PD-L1 expression in OSCC cell lines is upregulated by EGF via the EGF receptor (EGFR)/PI3K/AKT pathway, the EGFR/STAT1 pathway, and the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway, and by IFN-?3 via the JAK2/STAT1 pathway. MF-IHC demonstrated that STAT1 and EGFR phosphorylation was frequently shown in PD-L1-positive cases and STAT1 phosphorylation was correlated with lymphocyte infiltration and EGFR phosphorylation. Moreover, the phosphorylation pattern of the related molecules in PD-L1-positive cells differed among the cases investigated. These findings indicate that PD-L1 expression mechanisms differ depending on the tissue environment and suggest that the examination of the tissue environment and molecular alterations of cancer cells affecting PD-L1 expression make it necessary for each patient to choose the appropriate combination drugs for PD-1 blockade cancer treatment.","output":"In Situ PD-L1 Expression in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Is Induced by Heterogeneous Mechanisms among Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably heightened health and financial concerns for many individuals. Similar concerns, such as those associated with poverty, impair performance on cognitive control tasks. If ongoing concerns about COVID-19 substantially increase the tendency to mind wander in tasks requiring sustained attention, these worries could degrade performance on a wide range of tasks, leading, for example, to increased traffic accidents, diminished educational achievement, and lower workplace productivity. In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults' concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention. Experiment 1 tested mainly European participants during an early phase of the pandemic. After completing a survey probing COVID-related concerns, participants engaged in a continuous performance task (CPT) over two, 4-min blocks, during which they responded to city scenes that occurred 90% of the time and withheld responses to mountain scenes that occurred 10% of the time. Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT. These findings suggest that although COVID-19 increased anxiety in a broad swath of society, young adults are able to hold these concerns in a latent format, minimizing their impact on performance in a demanding sustained attention task.","output":"Do concerns about COVID-19 impair sustained attention?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In these intense COVID-multiple times, there is a need to recognize if an individual is wearing a face mask or not to ensure himself just as others around.

Derogatory nomenclatures such as Chinese-virus or Corona-jihad can be seen as a part of a disjunctive politics of representation as opposed to representing with a metonymic effect. Such politics violates the protocol on naming new human infectious diseases set by World Health Organization. It also insinuates a long-term socio-political impression on the mental state of an individual or a social group, which may have an emasculating effect on the global solidarity to fight the virus. This calls for a nuanced psychosocial investigation with a specific analysis of how the ensuing stigmatization and fear can aggravate the contagion. With specific reference to the Indian sub-continent, this paper explains the socio-political orientation behind the essentialisation of a religious group that has led to the indictment of the minority community. By using Wagners theory of essentialisation and Critical Race Theory, this article shall endeavor to explore how media may play a crucial role in stigmatizing communities.

Owing to the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, their use in mHealth PA interventions seems obvious; nevertheless, there are gaps in the literature on the evaluation reporting processes and best practices of such interventions. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review is to analyze the development and evaluation trajectory of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions and to review systematic theory- and evidence-based practices and methods that are implemented along this trajectory. The secondary objective is to identify the range of evidence (both quantitative and qualitative) available on smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions to provide a comprehensive tabular and narrative review of the available literature in terms of its nature, features, and volume. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies examining smartphone-based PA interventions published between 2008 and 2018. In line with scoping review guidelines, studies were not rejected based on their research design or quality. This review, therefore, includes experimental and descriptive studies, as well as reviews addressing smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA in all age groups (with a subanalysis conducted for adolescents). Two groups of studies were additionally included: reviews or content analyses of PA trackers and meta-analyses exploring behavior change techniques and their efficacy. RESULTS: Included articles (N=148) were categorized into 10 groups: commercial smartphone app content analyses, smartphone-based intervention review studies, activity tracker content analyses, activity tracker review studies, meta-analyses of PA intervention studies, smartphone-based intervention studies, qualitative formative studies, app development descriptive studies, qualitative follow-up studies, and other related articles. Only 24 articles targeted children or adolescents (age range: 5-19 years). There is no agreed evaluation framework or taxonomy to code or report smartphone-based PA interventions. Researchers did not state the coding method, used various evaluation frameworks, or used different versions of behavior change technique taxonomies. In addition, there is no consensus on the best behavior change theory or model that should be used in smartphone-based interventions for PA promotion. Commonly reported systematic practices and methods have been successfully identified. They include PA recommendations, trial designs (randomized controlled trials, experimental trials, and rapid design trials), mixed methods data collection (surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions), scales to assess app quality, and industry-recognized reporting guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA showed promising results for behavior change. Although there is a plethora of published studies on the adult target group, the number of studies and consequently the evidence base for adolescents is limited. Overall, the efficacy of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions can be considerably improved through a more systematic approach of developing, reporting, and coding of the interventions.","output":"Smartphone-Based Interventions for Physical Activity Promotion: Scoping Review of the Evidence Over the Last 10 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The paper builds on the classical understanding of the interplay between material processes and political conflicts, but generalises it in several key respects. This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or classes); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generates different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis.","output":"Generalising the political economy of structural change: A Structural Political Economy approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) infections have been occasionally described in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre, case-control study, we included 54 patients with CPE infection: 30 case-patients (COVID-19) and 24 controls (non-COVID-19), collected between March and May 2020. We compared the epidemiological, clinical features, and outcome between cases and controls. RESULTS: CPE infection was more frequent in COVID-19 patients than in controls (1.1 vs. 0.5%, p = .005). COVID-19 patients were younger, had a lower frequency of underlying diseases (p = .01), and a lower median Charlson score (p = .002). Predisposing factors such as antimicrobial use, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission, were more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .05). There were 73 episodes of infection (42 cases and 31 controls) that were more frequently hospital-acquired and diagnosed at the ICU in COVID-19 patients (p < .001). Urinary tract was the most common source of infection (47.9%), followed by pneumonia (23.3%). The frequency of severe sepsis or shock (p = .01) as well as the median SOFA score (p = .04) was higher in cases than in controls. Klebsiella pneumoniae (80.8%), Serratia marcescens (11%) and Enterobacter cloacae (4.1%) were the most common bacteria in both groups (KPC 56.2%, OXA-48 26% and VIM 17.8%). Overall 30-d mortality rate of COVID-19 patients and controls was 30 and 16.7%, respectively (p = .25).

In recent years, there has seen a significant increase in both the growth rate and cases of NSSI in Eastern countries, such as Japan, India, and China. In China, most schools have a mental health office that comprises mental health professionals (MHPs), who are the first to respond to student mental health problems, which include NSSI. MHPs possess comprehensive knowledge as well as unique insight into adolescent NSSI. However, very few studies on NSSI have incorporated their perspectives. In this work, we seek to add novel insight by conducting a study focusing on adolescent NSSI from the perspective of MHPs. Methods: We recruited a total of 24 MHPs from different schools using purposive sampling and conducted a semi-structured interview on NSSI-related issues. Each interview was voice recorded and lasted ~30 min. A thematic analysis was performed for the responses to study the most common and concerning issues underlying NSSI. Results: We extracted three major themes and eight sub-themes from the interview records, which included (1) the impact of Chinese culture on NSSI (sex-bias discrimination, overly high expectations, and inappropriate parenting style); (2) life events in school (internet use, academic pressure, and romantic relationships); and (3) opinions on the status quo of NSSI in China (ignorance and stigma). Conclusion: Results showed that culturally sensitive influential factors, such as sex-bias discrimination, the imposing of unrealistic expectations for personal achievement, and inappropriate parenting style, should be given more attention to prevent, assess, and intervene in NSSI.

The majority of approved antiviral agents are inhibitors of virus-specific targets that are encoded by individual viruses. These inhibitors are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents.

However, correlations of increased blood levels of a particular cytokine with wasting in AIDS have not been consistent observations, perhaps because cytokines act principally as paracrine and autocrine hormones, as well as indirectly by activating other systems.

By 2 separate conventional meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials of common respiratory viruses and observational studies of pandemic H1N1, pooled effects show no significant difference between N95 respirators and medical masks against common respiratory viruses for laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86C1.13, I(2) = 0.0%), clinical respiratory illness (risk ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.45C1.09, I(2) = 83.7%, P = .002), influenza-like illness (risk ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.54C1.05, I(2) = 0.0%), and pandemic H1N1 for laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.49C1.70, I(2) = 0.0%, P = .967). But by network meta-analysis, N95 respirators has a significantly stronger protection for HCWs from betacoronaviruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome, middle east respiratory syndrome, and corona virus disease 2019 (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.20C0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide moderate and very-low quality evidence of no significant difference between N95 respirators and medical masks for common respiratory viruses and pandemic H1N1, respectively. And we found low quality evidence that N95 respirators had a stronger protective effectiveness for HCWs against betacoronaviruses causative diseases compared to medical masks. The evidence of comparison between N95 respirators and medical masks for corona virus disease 2019 is open to question and needs further study.","output":"Protective efficient comparisons among all kinds of respirators and masks for health-care workers against respiratory viruses: A PRISMA-compliant network meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To summarise currently reported neonatal cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS A search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020, by combining the terms 'coronavirus' OR 'covid' OR 'SARS-CoV-2') AND ('neonat*' OR 'newborn') in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, MedRxiv, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review and the WHO COVID-19 database, with no language restrictions. Quality of studies was evaluated by using a specific tool for assessment of case reports and/or case series. RESULTS Twenty-six observational studies (18 case reports and 8 case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was 5 days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days. CONCLUSIONS Most neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms, generally were left in spontaneous breathing and had a good prognosis after median 10 days of hospitalisation. Large epidemiological and clinical cohort studies, as well as the implementation of collaborative networks, are needed to improve the understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.","output":"Coronavirus infection in neonates: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest advances of deep learning and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven more than once their high accuracy in disease detection. In this chapter, we propose a new deep learning-based approach for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images. The proposed approach applies, in an efficient way, the techniques of transfer learning and fine-tuning from pre-trained CNN models (InceptionV3, VGG16, MobileNet, EfficientNet, etc.). The dataset used for our experiments has three classes: normal, COVID-19, and other pathologies. The dataset is split into three sub-sets as follows: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for the final test. To avoid underfitting or overfitting problems during the training process, we apply regularization techniques (L1 & L2 regularizations, dropout, data augmentation, early stopping, cross-validation, etc.), which help in learning and providing a generalizable solution. As a result, we demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed CNNs for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. A comparison of different architectures shows that VGG16 and MobileNet provide the highest scores: 97.5% and 99.3% of accuracy respectively, 98.7% and 99.3% of sensitivity respectively. In addition, both models provide the scores of 96.3% and 99.2% respectively for specificity. The proposed solution is deployed in the cloud to provide high availability in real time, thanks to a responsive website, and this without the need to download, install, and configure the required libraries. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Chest X-ray Images Analysis with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, large amounts of COVID-19 misinformation are spreading on social media.

Two infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene revealed a close relation to the QX-like genotype which has not been detected in Sudan before. Whole genome analysis of IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251C15/2014 isolate by next generation sequencing revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides harbouring 13 open reading frames: 5-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3. Highest nucleotide sequence identity of 93% for the whole genome was found with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate ITA/90254/2005 and the 4/91 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251C15/2014 isolate clustered together with viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis gave evidence for distinct patterns of origin of RNA in the Sudanese isolate in multiple genes. Several sites of recombination were scattered throughout the genome suggesting that the Sudan-QX-like strain emerged as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental viruses from 4/91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005 genotypes.

The aim of the review is to discuss common features of these risk factors and the impact of vitamin D. RECENT FINDINGS The recently discovered relationship between vitamin D and the infection pathway of the virus via the renin--angiotensin system (RAS) and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin play an important role. The frequency of studies showing a relationship between a low vitamin D status in comorbidities and severe COVID-19 courses makes an impact of vitamin D effects likely. SUMMARY There is a direct relationship between vitamin D, body fat and age in COVID-19 courses. With age, the ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D decreases, and leads to vitamin D-deficits. If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes. Treatment with vitamin D supplements should be based on severity of the vitamin D deficiency.","output":"Obesity, vitamin D deficiency and old age a serious combination with respect to coronavirus disease-2019 severity and outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers across the world have risen to the demands of treating COVID-19 patients, potentially at significant cost to their own health and wellbeing. There has been increasing recognition of the potential mental health impact of COVID-19 on frontline workers and calls to provide psychosocial support for them. However, little attention has so far been paid to understanding the impact of working on a pandemic from healthcare workers own perspectives or what their views are about support. METHODS: We searched key healthcare databases (Medline, PsychINFO and PubMed) from inception to September 28, 2020. We also reviewed relevant grey literature, screened pre-print servers and hand searched reference lists of key texts for all published accounts of healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and views about support during COVID-19 and previous pandemics/epidemics. We conducted a meta-synthesis of all qualitative results to synthesise findings and develop an overarching set of themes and sub-themes which captured the experiences and views of frontline healthcare workers across the studies. RESULTS: This review identified 46 qualitative studies which explored healthcare workers experiences and views from pandemics or epidemics including and prior to COVID-19. Meta-synthesis derived eight key themes which largely transcended temporal and geographical boundaries. Participants across all the studies were deeply concerned about their own and/or others physical safety. This was greatest in the early phases of pandemics and exacerbated by inadequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), insufficient resources, and inconsistent information. Workers struggled with high workloads and long shifts and desired adequate rest and recovery. Many experienced stigma. Healthcare workers relationships with families, colleagues, organisations, media and the wider public were complicated and could be experienced concomitantly as sources of support but also sources of stress. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are not unprecedented; the themes that arose from previous pandemics and epidemics were remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of COVID-19 globally today. We have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of previous crises, mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce worldwide.

The peptide L-glutamyl-L-tryptophan (EW/IM862) has been claimed to exhibit inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo. However, the potential role of natural peptides with respect to anti-angiogenic properties is unsettled. The current study explores anti-angiogenic effects of the dipeptides WL, EW, IW, and WE. METHODS AND RESULTS Using a bottom-up strategy, we first evaluated the effects of the peptides on VEGFR-2 signalling and quantified their effects in different angiogenesis assays. WL consistently had the strongest effects on phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and downstream signalling. Therefore, this peptide was chosen in comparison with EW to further assess anti-angiogenic properties. However, sprout formation in 3D fibrin gel bead assay was significantly inhibited by EW only. Furthermore, vessel sprouting in the mouse aortic ring assay was decreased by the presence of WL and EW compared to control. Results from a chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that under VEGF stimulation WL and EW decreased the number of blood vessels versus control. These results were in line with those obtained in a matrigel plug assay. The VEGF-induced increase in the hemoglobin content was nearly abolished when treatment was combined with either WL or EW application. In the murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, WL exhibited a small albeit significant anti-angiogenetic effect. CONCLUSION Comprehensive screening of WL suggests an anti-angiogenic effect, demonstrated in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. Thus, WL is a dipeptide with potential anti-angiogenic effects and is worthy for further exploration.","output":"Characterization of tryptophan-containing dipeptides for anti-angiogenic effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Dual-energy CT perfusion imaging for differentiating WHO subtypes of thymic epithelial tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fast way to reconstruct the three-dimensional molecular conformation of SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins is addressed in this article, involving the most worrying variant discovered in patients from Brazil, the lineage B.1.1.28/P.1.

This study aimed to quantify in-hospital GV in CAP patients, including determining the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glucocorticoid (GC) treatment on GV. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of CAP patients (N = 40) with or without T2DM and treated or not with GCs. The primary endpoint was GV measured as glucose standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and postprandial glucose excursions (PPGE) based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Analysis of glucose data was split into daytime and nighttime when possible. RESULTS: Patients included had a mean age of 74 (range 55 to 91) years. SD (95%CI) increased by a factor of 1.93 (1.40 to 2.66) and 2.29 (1.38 to 3.81) in patients with T2DM and not treated with GCs during the daytime and the nighttime, respectively (both P < 0.01), and by a factor of 1.42 (1.04 to 1.97) in patients treated with GCs but without T2DM during the daytime (P = 0.031) compared to patients without T2DM and not treated with GCs. CV (95%CI) increased by 5.1 (0.0 to 10.1) and 8.1 (1.0 to 15.2) percentage points during the daytime and the nighttime, respectively, in patients with T2DM and not treated with GCs compared to patients without T2DM and not treated with GCs (P = 0.046 and P = 0.026, respectively). PPGE (95% CI) increased during lunch by 2.5 (0.7 to 4.3) mmol/L (45 (13 to 77) mg/dL) in patients with T2DM and treated with GCs compared to patients without T2DM and not treated with GCs (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: CAP patients receiving GCs, especially those with T2DM, are at great risk of developing high GV and therefore require clinical attention to mitigate GV.

Patient receiving maintenance haemodialysis are at increased risk for infection by SARS-CoV-2 with poor outcome. So, the purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on maintenance haemodialysis. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a haemodialysis unit of tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh from April to August 2020. All patients, who were on maintenance haemodialysis, twice or thrice weekly, were screened by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of symptoms. All data were collected in case record forms and patients were followed-up over phone. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 133 patients (males 70, 52.6%) were on regular maintenance haemodialysis in the study centre. Most patients were in 5th and 6th decades of life. Twenty-one (15.8%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR with female (16, 76.2%) predominance. Eighteen (18/21, 85.7%) patients had symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and rest three (3/21, 14.3%) patients were diagnosed during routine screening. Common presentations were fever (42.9%), cough (66.7%) and respiratory distress (66.7%) and most had multiple symptoms. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in blood group A was 8(38%) and blood group O was 8(38%). There were no significant differences of mortality rate among blood groups. Most patients (16/21, 76.2%) infected by SARS-CoV-2 were referred to COVID-dedicated hospitals, five (5/21, 23.8%) were shifted to intensive care unit (ICU). Outcome was poor; 17 (17/21, 89%) patients died in hospitals and four (4/21, 19%) patients became free of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving children and adults with PCD and thus evidence of efficacy for interventions are usually extrapolated from people with cystic fibrosis. Our planned RCT seeks to address some of these unmet needs by employing a currently prescribed (but unapproved for long-term use in PCD) macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin) and a novel mucolytic agent (erdosteine). The primary aim of our RCT is to determine whether regular oral azithromycin and erdosteine over a 12-month period reduces acute respiratory exacerbations among children and adults with PCD. Our primary hypothesis is that: people with PCD who regularly use oral azithromycin and/or erdosteine will have fewer exacerbations than those receiving the corresponding placebo medications. Our secondary aims are to determine the effect of the trial medications on PCD-specific quality-of-life (QoL) and other clinical outcomes (lung function, time-to-next exacerbation, hospitalisations) and nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are currently undertaking a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy RCT to evaluate whether 12 months of azithromycin and/or erdosteine is beneficial for children and adults with PCD. We plan to recruit 104 children and adults with PCD to a parallel, 22 partial factorial superiority RCT at five sites across Australia. Our primary endpoint is the rate of exacerbations over 12 months. Our main secondary outcomes are QoL, lung function and nasopharyngeal carriage by respiratory bacterial pathogens and their associated azithromycin resistance.

METHODS Six anaesthetized and muscle-relaxed adult rabbits were stabilized on HFJV. CS was performed using all permutations of three CS methods (Continual negative pressure, negative pressure applied during Withdrawal, and HFJV in Standby) and 6 French gauge (6 FG) and 8 French gauge (8 FG) catheter, randomly assigned. The sequence was repeated using post-suction sighs. P(trach), absolute (respiratory inductive plethysmography) and regional (electrical impedance tomography; expressed as percentage of vital capacity for the defined region of interest, %Z(VCroi) ) EELV were measured before, during and 60 sec post-suction. RESULTS CS methods exerted no difference on P(trach), EELV(RIP), or %Z(VCroi) . 8FG catheter resulted in a mean (95%CI) 20.0 (17.9,22.2) cm H(2)O greater loss of P(trach) during suction compared to 6FG (Bonferroni post-test). Mean ( SD) EELV(RIP) was -6(3) and -2(1) ml/kg with the 8 and 6 FG catheters (P < 0.0001; Bonferroni post-test).

This is an approach that can be used in other difficult hydrophobic peptides.","output":"Expression and purification of coronavirus envelope proteins using a modified -barrel construct"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS By associating features with orthonormal bases, we analyse the values of the extracted features for the daily biweekly growth rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths on national and continental levels. METHODS By adopting the concept of Fourier coefficients, we analyse the inner products with respect to temporal and spatial frequencies on national and continental levels. The input data are the global time series data with 117 countries over 109 days on a national level; and 6 continents over 447 days on a continental level. Next, we calculate the Euclidean distance matrices and their average variabilities, which measure the average discrepancy between one feature vector and all others. Then we analyse the temporal and spatial variabilities on a national level. By calculating the temporal inner products on a continental level, we derive and analyse the similarities between the continents. RESULTS On the national level, the daily biweekly growth rates bear higher similarities in the time dimension than the ones in the space dimension. Furthermore, there exists a strong concurrency between the features for biweekly growth rates of cases and deaths. As far as the trends of the features are concerned, the features are stabler on the continental level, and less predictive on the national level. In addition, there are very high similarities between all the continents, except Asia. CONCLUSIONS The features for daily biweekly growth rates of cases and deaths are extracted via orthonormal frequencies. By tracking the inner products for the input data and the orthonormal features, we could decompose the evolutionary results of COVID-19 into some fundamental frequencies. Though the frequency-based techniques are applied, the interpretation of the features should resort to other methods. By analysing the spectrum of the frequencies, we reveal hidden patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic. This would provide some preliminary research merits for further insightful investigations. It could also be used to predict future trends of daily biweekly growth rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths.","output":"Extracted features of national and continental daily biweekly growth rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths via Fourier analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men. Common treatments include active surveillance, surgery, or radiation. Androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy are usually reserved for advanced disease or biochemical recurrence, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but they are not considered curative because PCa cells eventually develop drug resistance. The latter is achieved through various cellular mechanisms that ultimately circumvent the pharmaceuticals mode of action. The need for novel therapeutic approaches is necessary under these circumstances. An alternative way to treat PCa is by repurposing of existing drugs that were initially intended for other conditions. By extrapolating the effects of previously approved drugs to the intracellular processes of PCa, treatment options will expand. In addition, drug repurposing is cost-effective and efficient because it utilizes drugs that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy. This review catalogues the drugs that can be repurposed for PCa in preclinical studies as well as clinical trials.","output":"Overcoming Drug Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer by Drug Repurposing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed what may soon become a permanent digital transition in the domains of work, education, medicine, and leisure.

In contrast to bulky tumor cells, CSCs remain less differentiated and resistant to therapy even when targeted with tissue-specific antigenic markers. This makes CSCs responsible for not only tumor initiation, development, but also tumor recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that CSCs can undergo cell senescence, a non-proliferative state of cells in response to stress. While cell senescence attenuates tumor cell proliferation, it is commonly regarded as a tumor suppressive mechanism. However, mounting research indicates that CSC senescence also provides these cells with the capacity to evade cytotoxic effects from cancer therapy, exacerbating cancer relapse and metastasis. Recent studies demonstrate that senescence drives reprogramming of cancer cell towards stemness and promotes CSC generation. In this review, we highlight the origin, heterogeneity and senescence regulatory mechanisms of CSCs, the complex relationship between CSC senescence and tumor therapy, and the recent beneficial effects of senotherapy on eliminating senescent tumor cells.","output":"Mechanisms of Cancer Stem Cell Senescence: Current Understanding and Future Perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaphylactic reactions to mRNA COVID\\\\19 vaccines have been reported, with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) they contain being considered a possible culprit allergen.

However, social distancing policies and restrictions on public activities have been implemented since the outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in Taiwan. These restrictions not only prevent older individuals from performing meaningful activities but also have actual impacts on their daily life. This study aims to elucidate the intervening role of meanings of life activities on the relationship between functional status and COVID-19 disruptions. Data were collected from a sample of 526 community-dwelling older adults with disabilities in Taiwan between April and July, 2020. Utilizing Multiple Regression Analysis, the research findings were as follows. First, participants with better functional status experienced more COVID-19 related disruptions to their daily routine. In the meantime, they also valued their life activities as more meaningful than those with worse functional status. Second, higher levels of meanings in performing life activities also positively related to COVID-19 disruptions. Third, meanings of life activities fully mediated the relationship between functional status and COVID-19 disruptions. That is, disabled older individuals with better functional status may experience more COVID-19 related disruptions because their accessibility to meaningful activities was limited. Since preventive approaches to control the spread are necessary during COVID-19 epidemic, efforts should be made to sustain meaningful life activities participation among disabled older adults. Based on the findings of this study, this would be especially critical to the well-being of more capable older individuals with disabilities during the pandemic.","output":"Functional Status, Meanings of Life Activities, and COVID-19 Related Disruptions among Disabled Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted immunization of centralized nodes in large-scale networks has attracted significant attention. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or quarantine) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of the current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central among these n nodes is immunized. This process can globally immunize a network. We find that even for small n (10) there is significant improvement in the immunization (quarantine) which is very close to the levels of an immunization with full knowledge. We develop an analytical framework for our method and determine the critical percolation threshold p(c) and the size of the giant component P() for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n   we recover prior work on targeted immunization, whereas for n = 1 we recover the known case of random immunization. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, p(c) increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization with complete information. In particular, we find a new general scaling relationship between |p(c)() ? p(c)(n)| and n as |p(c)() ? p(c)(n)|  n(?1)exp ( ? n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)  k(?), 2 <  < 3, we find that p(c) has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n = 1 to O(log N) (where N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, having knowledge of log N nodes and immunizing them can dramatically reduce epidemic spreading.

Originating from military experiences, the phenomenon also has relevance for healthcare professionals dealing with wars, natural disasters and infectious diseases. The deontological basis of medicine prioritises duty to the individual patient over duty to wider society. These values may place healthcare professionals at increased risk of moral injury, particularly in crisis contexts where they may be party to decisions to withdraw or divert care based on resource availability. We conducted a systematic review of medical literature to understand the extent and clinical and socio-demographic correlates of moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review of reports included in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, EMCARE and HMIC databases using search terms: moral injury AND covid OR coronavirus OR pandemic. We also searched Google Scholar and Ovid Database and conducted reference searching. We searched for published quantitative primary research as well as advance online publications and pre-print research. Findings are reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA). Two authors independently assessed the included studies methodological quality using a seven-item checklist. RESULT: Our databases search identified 498 records and other sources identified 4 records. We screened 391 records after removing duplicates. 4 reports met our protocol requirements. Three papers used cross-sectional designs. One reported longitudinal outcomes of their sample already described in one of the three papers. Only one study used a MI scoring system validated for healthcare professionals. Others used scoring validated in military populations. These papers reported outcomes from 3334 subjects, with a higher proportion of females. The largest study (3006 subjects) reported MI in 41.3% of their sample. Overall, factors associated with greater MI included: providing direct care to COVID-19 patients; sleep troubles; being unmarried; aged <30 years; female gender; and Buddhist/Taoist faith. Nurses reported a greater severity of MI than physicians. MI significantly correlated with anxiety, depression and burnout. The longitudinal study reported that more stressful and less supportive work environments predicted greater MI at 3 months follow-up. The average quality assessment score of these studies was 4/7.

Now known to the world as COVID-19, the devastating disease of what has become a pandemic started its spread from Wuhan, China and swiftly engulfed the whole world with almost 11 million cases, in a span of around six months. It has not only increased the global burden of disease but has heavily dented many social institutions, including education. METHODS: This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures of lockdown, quarantine, and social distancing have affected students. We look specifically into the effects on individuals mental health, that is, the stress and anxiety levels of college and university students using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). RESULTS: Among 494 respondents, 61% were females, and the majority (77.3%) of the students were in the age group of 19C25 years. Among the respondents, 125 (25.3%), 45 (9.1%) and 34 (6.9%) experienced minimal to moderate, severe, and most extreme levels of anxiety, respectively. The variables of gender, age and year of study were significant at the 0.25 level by univariate analyses. Nevertheless, the ordinal regression indicates that only gender was significant. The odds of a female student being more anxious are higher compared to a male student (OR = 1.779, 95% CI [1.202C2.634], P = 0.004). The most prominent stressors attained from the qualitative feedback from the Pakistani students are associated with online teaching, concerns about their academic performance and completion of the current semester, uncertainty related to exam dates, and the status of the following semester. CONCLUSIONS: This study will add to the existing body of literature on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and psychological health of students. The study outcomes will provide basic data for further applied and action research and a framework for universities and policy makers in Pakistan and the neighboring countries in the region with the same cultural contexts. Thus, relevant health interventions can be designed for better mental health and educational attainments of students from higher educational institutions. This pathological pandemic may well lead to another pandemic of mental and behavioral illness. All stakeholders should join force regardless of pre-existing differences and inequalities to ensure the well-being of future generations, specifically students from higher educational institutions.

HTLV-1 has currently infected up to 10 million globally with highly endemic areas in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. We have previously shown that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enhance HTLV-1 transmission by promoting cellCcell contact. RESULTS: Here, we separated EVs into subpopulations using differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) at speeds of 2 k (2000g), 10 k (10,000g), and 100 k (100,000g) from infected cell supernatants. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs contain the highest viral/host protein abundance in the 2 k subpopulation (2 k > 10 k > 100 k). The 2 k and 10 k populations contained viral proteins (i.e., p19 and Tax), and autophagy proteins (i.e., LC3 and p62) suggesting presence of autophagosomes as well as core histones. Interestingly, the use of 2 k EVs in an angiogenesis assay (mesenchymal stem cells + endothelial cells) caused deterioration of vascular-like-tubules. Cells commonly associated with the neurovascular unit (i.e., astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages) in the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) showed that HTLV-1 EVs may induce expression of cytokines involved in migration (i.e., IL-8; 100 k > 2 k > 10 k) from astrocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (i.e., IL-8; 2 k > 10 k). Finally, we found that EVs were able to promote cellCcell contact and viral transmission in monocytic cell-derived dendritic cell. The EVs from both 2 k and 10 k increased HTLV-1 spread in a humanized mouse model, as evidenced by an increase in proviral DNA and RNA in the Blood, Lymph Node, and Spleen.

After populations recover from fishing pressure, abundances and densities of formerly fished species increase, and we should therefore expect changes in demographic traits compared to those in exploited populations. To test this, we used capture-mark-recapture data for 10 Galaxias maculatus populations across a density gradient mediated by different degrees of fishery closure. We examined the extent to which density-dependent () and density-independent (DI) effects interact to affect specific growth rates in post-recruit populations. We found that population density, stream temperature and individual size interact to affect growth rates. When population densities were high, compensatory responses of far slower growth rates were strongest, indicating that  growth is a key mechanism regulating post-recruit populations of G. maculatus. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding  and DI processes, their interactions, function and effectiveness for freshwater fisheries management. For FPAs to be effective, the extent and quality of target species' habitats must serve as key criteria for protection to alleviate competition for limited resources that underpins  processes.","output":"Interacting effects of density and temperature on fish growth rates in freshwater protected populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 usually begins with respiratory symptoms but may also cause neurological disturbances by direct (viral invasion) or indirect (immune-mediated) mechanism.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A. hierochuntica ethanolic (KEE), and aqueous (KAE) extracts on CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity in rats using the biochemical markers for renal functions and antioxidant status as well as histopathological examinations of kidney tissue. A. hierochuntica contained 67.49 mg GAE g(?1) of total phenolic compounds (TPC), 3.51 g g(?1) of total carotenoids (TC), and 49.78 and 17.45 mg QE g(?1) of total flavonoids (TF) and total flavonols (TFL), respectively. It resulted in 128.71 mol of TE g(?1) of DPPH-RSA and 141.92 mol of TE g(?1) of ABTS-RSA. A. hierochuntica presented superior antioxidant activity by inhibiting linoleic acid radicals and chelating oxidation metals. The HPLC analysis resulted in 9 and 21 phenolic acids and 6 and 2 flavonoids in KEE and KAE with a predominance of sinapic and syringic acids, respectively. Intramuscular injection of vit. E + Se and oral administration of KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE at 250 mg kg(?1) body weight significantly restored serum creatinine, urea, K, total protein, and albumin levels. Additionally, they reduced malondialdehyde (MOD), restored reduced-glutathione (GSH), and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE protected the kidneys from CCl(4)-nephrotoxicity as they mainly attenuated induced oxidative stress.

In conclusion, A. hierochuntica, especially KAE, has the potential capability to restore oxidative stability and improve kidney function after CCl(4) acute kidney injury better than KEE. Therefore, A. hierochuntica has the potential to be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of drug-induced nephrotoxicity.","output":"Antioxidant Activity, Phenolic Profile, and Nephroprotective Potential of Anastatica hierochuntica Ethanolic and Aqueous Extracts against CCl(4)-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious disease, which causes economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide.

However, when lactating animals feed on Aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-containing feed, the hydroxyl metabolite aflatoxin M(1) (AFM(1)) contaminates the milk and dairy products. The objective of the current study was to assess the level of AFM(1) in raw milk, normally pasteurized milk and Ethiopian cottage cheese collected from value chain actors (producers, collectors, processors and retailers). Cross-sectional study and simple random techniques were used to collect primary samples. A total of 160 composite samples was collected; raw milk (n = 64), pasteurized milk (n = 64) and cheese (n = 32) was analyzed. Quantitative analysis of AFM(1) was conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicate that AFM(1) was detected in all milk products. Results along value chains show that the concentration of AFM(1) in raw milk from collectors was significantly higher than from producers, and in pasteurized milk from processors and retailers (p < 0.05). However, no significant (p > 0.05) difference was observed in cottage cheese value-chain actors in all regions. Comparison of AFM(1) mean values among all dairy products shows that raw milk had a significantly higher concentration of AFM(1) followed by pasteurized milk and cottage cheese. However, there was no significant difference between raw and pasteurized milk (p > 0.05). The mean AFM(1) contamination in milk products ranged from 0.137 to 0.319 g/L (mean value 0.285 g/L). The contamination percentages of AFM(1) in raw milk (62.50%), pasteurized milk (67.20%) and cottage cheese (25%) were above the regulatory limit set by the European Union (EU) (0.05 g/L). According to USA/Ethiopian Standard (US/ES) (0.50 g/L), 21.87%, 25% and 1% exceeded the regulatory limit for the above products, respectively.

It then elaborates three main tenets of new materialisms methodology, theory, and ontology: its attention to matter in its physicality;the embedded and entangled subject;and the vitality or agency of objects.

The aims of this study were to assess the case fatality rate of children admitted to an inner-city hospital for acute poisoning and to compare the demographics and source of poisoning of fatal cases. METHODS This was a retrospective review of patient data recorded in the Hospital Information System for Loghman Hakim Hospital, that is, the central referral hospital for poisoning in Tehran, Iran. We searched Hospital Information System for all admissions for poisoning in children (age, 0-12 years) over the 10-year period from March 2010 to March 2020, and all cases were included in the analysis. We determined the case fatality rate by dividing the number of fatal cases by the number of included cases. RESULTS Of 8158 children admitted for poisoning, 28 cases (0.3%) died, among whom 19 (67.9%) were boys and 9 (32.1%) girls. The median age was 42 months, ranging from 2 to 144 months. Twenty-two cases (78.6%) were 0 to 5 years old. The most common cause of mortality in acute poisoning was methadone (n = 13, 46.4%), followed by raw opium (n = 5, 17.9%), aluminum phosphide, carbon monoxide, and wild mushrooms (n = 2 deaths each, 7.1%). Tramadol, colchicine, and petroleum accounted for 1 death each (3.6%). CONCLUSIONS Mortality from unintentional poisoning disproportionately affects children younger than 5 years. Opioids (ie, methadone, opium, tramadol) accounted for two thirds of deaths in our sample.

Existing systematic reviews are scarce, outdated and incomplete. The primary aim of this systematic review is to identify multivariable models and/or predictors associated with clinical outcomes in subjects with CLBP (namely pain intensity, disability, return to work, psychological well-being and quality of life). METHODS We will systematically search Ovid MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science databases for longitudinal studies, published until June 2017, including adults with CLBP (defined as persistent pain with  3 months duration), which studied the association between multivariable models and/or predictors with at least one of the selected clinical outcomes after  3 months of follow-up. Articles' screening and selection will be conducted by two reviewers, blindly and independently. Disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Models' discriminative ability will be assessed using C-statistic. The link between multivariable models and predictors with the clinical outcome will be analysed through association measures. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the available evidence will be performed. Meta-analysis will be conducted to aggregate each type of measure. In the absence or in the presence of only slight to moderate of heterogeneity, we will use the fixed or random effects model, respectively. In case of moderate to severe heterogeneity, an attempt to explain variability in detail will be made through subgroups and sensitivity analyses.

Immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CPT) is one such therapeutic option. Methods: A systematized search was conducted for articles published between December 2019 and 18th January 2021 focusing on convalescent plasma efficacy and safety in COVID-19. The primary outcomes were defined as mortality benefit in patients treated with convalescent plasma compared to standard therapy/placebo. The secondary outcome was pooled mortality rate and the adverse event rate in convalescent plasma-treated patients. Results: A total of 27,706 patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and a total of 3,262 (2,127 in convalescent plasma-treated patients and 1,135 in the non-convalescent plasma/control group) patients died. The quantitative synthesis in 23 studies showed that the odds of mortality in patients who received plasma therapy were significantly lower than those in patients who did not receive plasma therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53C0.80, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 15%). The mortality benefit remains the same even for 14 trials/prospective studies (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43C0.81, p = 0.001, I(2) = 22%) as well as for nine case series/retrospective observational studies (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65C0.94, p = 0.01, I(2) = 0%). However, in a subgroup analysis for 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality between the CPT group compared to the non-CPT group (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53C1.08, p = 0.13, I(2) = 7%). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of 10 RCTs, excluding the study with the highest statistical weight, displayed a lower mortality rate compared to that of non-CPT COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42C0.97, p = 0.04, I(2) = 0%). The observed pooled mortality rate was 12.9% (95% CI 9.7C16.9%), and the pooled adverse event rate was 6.1% (95% CI 3.2C11.6), with significant heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance: Our systemic review and meta-analysis suggests that CPT could be an effective therapeutic option with promising evidence on the safety and reduced mortality in concomitant treatment for COVID-19 along with antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, steroids, and other supportive care. Future exploratory studies could benefit from more standardized reporting, especially in terms of the timing of interventions and clinically relevant outcomes, like days until discharge from the hospital and improvement of clinical symptoms.","output":"Mortality Benefit of Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by loss of motor and sensory function that results from immune-mediated inflammation, demyelination, and subsequent axonal damage.

Acute pericarditis with or without myocardial involvement is diagnosed on clinical presentation, serum inflammatory markers, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Multimodality imaging may also have an additional diagnostic value. Patients are usually managed medically, but some patients develop a life-threatening pericardial tamponade necessitating pericardial drainage.

The procedure was successfully performed in all patients. No conversions to a multiple-port approach or to an open procedure were necessary. There were no mortalities, major complications, or recurrences during the mean follow-up period of 4 weeks. CONCLUSION Single incision ventral hernia repair is technically feasible, effective, and reproducible. The technique is easy to master, and safe for any patient who is a candidate for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Further data collection with long-term follow-up will be needed to ensure equivalent outcomes. There will be demand for this approach by patients for cosmetic reasons, and it may serve as a bridge to natural orifice techniques.","output":"Single incision laparoscopic ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate novel emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages in Japan that harbor variants in the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD).

The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from these patients were examined for variants in spike protein RBD. In January 2021, three family members (one aged in their 40s and two aged under 10 years old) were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring W152L/E484K/G769V mutations. These three patients were living in Japan and had no history of traveling abroad.

The aim of this international study was to explore and compare the perceived impact of COVID-19 and associated public health restrictions on the lives of people living with dementia and informal carers and access to dementia care across five countries. METHODS: Informal carers and people living with dementia who were residing in the community in the UK, Australia, Italy, India, and Poland were interviewed remotely between April and December 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of the pandemic and how restrictions have impacted on their lives and care. Transcripts were analysed by researchers in each country using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen people living with dementia and 111 informal carers participated across the five countries. Four themes emerged: (1) Limited access and support; (2) Technology and issues accessing remote support; (3) Emotional impact; and (4) Decline of cognitive and physical health reported by carers. Whilst variations were noted, the pandemic has indirectly affected people with dementia and carers across all five countries. The pandemic removed access to social support services and thus increased carer burden. Remote services were not always provided and were very limited in benefit and usability for those with dementia. As a result, carers appeared to notice reduced cognitive and physical health in people with dementia. Particular differences were noted between India and Poland vs. the UK, Italy, and Australia, with less impact on care provision in the former due to limited uptake of support services pre-pandemic based on cultural settings. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has amplified dementia as a global public health problem, and people affected by the condition need support to better access vital support services to live well.

However, the molecular regulators that establish and maintain the features of GM-CSF-positive CD4 T cells are unknown. In order to identify these regulators, we isolated human GM-CSF-producing CD4 T cells from human peripheral blood by using a cytokine capture assay. We compared these cells to the corresponding GM-CSF-negative fraction, and furthermore, we studied na?ve CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, and bulk CD4 T cells from the same individuals as additional control cell populations. As a result, we provide a rich resource of integrated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from these primary human CD4 T cell subsets and we show that the identified signatures are associated with human autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis. By combining information about mRNA expression, DNA accessibility, and predicted transcription factor binding, we reconstructed directed gene regulatory networks connecting transcription factors to their targets, which comprise putative key regulators of human GM-CSF-positive CD4 T cells as well as memory CD4 T cells.

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition. Nevertheless, although the violence of the pandemic may suggest the use of heroic treatments to reduce the frightening mortality that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that experimental treatments should only be used within approved and controlled protocols, the only ones that can provide useful and specify information on the validity of the treatments.","output":"Coagulopathy and thromboembolic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: pathogenesis and management strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Worldwide mandates for social distancing and home-quarantine have contributed to loneliness and social isolation. We conducted a systematic scoping review to identify network-building interventions that address loneliness and isolation, describe their components and impact on network structure, and consider their application in the wake of COVID19. METHODS: We performed forward and backward citation tracking of three seminal publications on network interventions and Bibliographic search of Web of Science and SCOPUS. We developed data charting tables and extracted and synthesized the characteristics of included studies, using an iteratively updating form. FINDINGS: From 3390 retrieved titles and abstracts, we included 8 studies. These interventions focused on building networks at either individual- or group-levels. Key elements that were incorporated in the interventions at varying degrees included (a) creating opportunities to build networks; (b) improving social skills; (c) assessing network diagnostics (i.e. using network data or information to inform network strategies); (d) promoting engagement with influential actors; and (e) a process for goal-setting and feedback. The effect of interventions on network structures, or the moderating effect of structure on the intervention effectiveness was rarely assessed. CONCLUSIONS: As many natural face-to-face opportunities for social connection are limited due to COVID19, groups already at risk for social isolation and loneliness are disproportionately impacted. Network-building interventions include multiple components that address both the structure of individuals networks, and their skills and motivation for activating them. These intervention elements could be adapted for delivery via online platforms, and implemented by trained facilitators or novice volunteers, although more rigorous testing is needed.","output":"Individual- and group-level network-building interventions to address social isolation and loneliness: A scoping review with implications for COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was monitored in environmental samples from rural and vulnerable areas (a presidio, worker accommodation units, and river waters upstream and downstream of a rural community) from Minas Gerais State region, Southern Brazil, in August 2020.

The model adopts a Bayesian framework for probabilistic graph matching, operating on semantic relation networks constructed from distributed representations of individual concepts and of relations between concepts. Through comparisons of model predictions with human performance in a novel mapping task requiring integration of multiple relations, as well as in several classic studies, we demonstrate that the model accounts for a broad range of phenomena involving analogical mapping by both adults and children.

The implementation of evidence-based treatments can improve the quality of care. METHODS: The new clinical practice guideline is based on publications retrieved by a systematic search in the Medline databases via PubMed and in the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, followed by a structured consensus process leading to the adoption of graded recommendations. RESULTS: Therapeutic anticoagulation can be considered in patients who do not require intensive care and have an elevated risk of thromboembolism (for example, those with D-dimer levels  2 mg/L). For patients in intensive care, therapeutic anticoagulation has no benefit. For patients with hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, prone positioning and an early therapy attempt with CPAP/noninvasive ventilation (CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure) or high-flow oxygen therapy is recommended. Patients with IgG-seronegativity and, at most, low-flow oxygen should be treated with SARS-CoV-2- specific monoclonal antibodies (at present, casirivimab and imdevimab). Patients needing no more than low-flow oxygen should additionally be treated with janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. All patients who need oxygen (low-flow, high-flow, noninvasive ventilation/CPAP, invasive ventilation) should be given systemic corticosteroids. Tocilizumab should be given to patients with a high oxygen requirement and progressively severe COVID-19 disease, but not in combination with JAK inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy, prone positioning, and invasive ventilation are important elements of the treatment of hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.

Changing the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) tension in arterial blood is commonly used as a cerebral vasoactive stimulus to assess the cerebral vascular response, changing cerebral blood flow (CBF) by up to 5-11 percent/mmHg in normal adults. Here we describe two approaches to generating the CO(2) challenge using a computer-controlled gas blender to administer: i) a square wave change in CO(2) and, ii) a ramp stimulus, consisting of a continuously graded change in CO(2) over a range. Responses were assessed regionally by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We studied 8 patients with known cerebrovascular disease (carotid stenosis or occlusion) and 2 healthy subjects. The square wave stimulus was used to study the dynamics of the vascular response, while the ramp stimulus assessed the steady-state response to CO(2). Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps were registered by color coding and overlaid on the anatomical scans generated with 3 Tesla MRI to assess the corresponding BOLD signal change/mmHg change in CO(2), voxel-by-voxel. Using a fractal temporal approach, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) maps of the processed raw BOLD signal per voxel over the same CO(2) range were generated. Regions of BOLD signal decrease with increased CO(2) (coded blue) were seen in all of these high-risk patients, indicating regions of impaired CVR. All patients also demonstrated regions of altered signal structure on DFA maps (Hurst exponents less than 0.5; coded blue) indicative of anti-persistent noise. While 'blue' CVR maps remained essentially stable over the time of analysis, 'blue' DFA maps improved.

Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%.

This creek has long been considered as a dumping ground for industrial wastes and has resulted in surface and ground water pollution in the entire lower Indus Basin. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), Nitrogen Content Index (NI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) were compared prior (2019) and during (2020) lockdown in the creek. There was a significant enhancement in NDVI, NDWI, NDCI, and NI values, and reduction in NDTI and TSM values during the lockdown period. When compared with prior year (2019), the values of indices suggested an improvement in water quality and an indicative change in aquatic ecology in the creek. The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the improvement in water quality of Buddha Nala was more evident in the upstream and downstream sections than the middle section.

It is written with the goal of rationalizing and informing public health concerns related to this sometimes-strange new science of \\"nano,\\" while raising awareness of nanomaterials' toxicity among scientists and manufacturers handling them.We show that humans have always been exposed to tiny particles via dust storms, volcanic ash, and other natural processes, and that our bodily systems are well adapted to protect us from these potentially harmful intruders. There ticuloendothelial system, in particular, actively neutralizes and eliminates foreign matter in the body,including viruses and nonbiological particles. Particles originating from human activities have existed for millennia, e.g., smoke from combustion and lint from garments, but the recent development of industry and combustion-based engine transportation has profoundly increased an thropogenic particulate pollution. Significantly, technological advancement has also changed the character of particulate pollution, increasing the proportion of nanometer-sized particles--\\"nanoparticles\\"--and expanding the variety of chemical compositions. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between particulate air pollution levels, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, and mortality. Adverse effects of nanoparticles on human health depend on individual factors such as genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry, size, shape,agglomeration state, and electromagnetic properties. Animal and human studies show that inhaled nanoparticles are less efficiently removed than larger particles by the macrophage clearance mechanisms in the lungs, causing lung damage, and that nanoparticles can translocate through the circulatory, lymphatic, and nervous systems to many tissues and organs, including the brain. The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function.Examples of toxic effects include tissue inflammation, and altered cellular redox balance toward oxidation, causing abnormal function or cell death. The manipulation of matter at the scale of atoms,\\"nanotechnology,\\" is creating many new materials with characteristics not always easily predicted from current knowledge. Within the nearly limitless diversity of these materials, some happen to be toxic to biological systems, others are relatively benign, while others confer health benefits. Some of these materials have desirable characteristics for industrial applications, as nanostructured materials often exhibit beneficial properties, from UV absorbance in sunscreen to oil-less lubrication of motors.A rational science-based approach is needed to minimize harm caused by these materials, while supporting continued study and appropriate industrial development. As current knowledge of the toxicology of \\"bulk\\" materials may not suffice in reliably predicting toxic forms of nanoparticles,ongoing and expanded study of \\"nanotoxicity\\" will be necessary. For nanotechnologies with clearly associated health risks, intelligent design of materials and devices is needed to derive the benefits of these new technologies while limiting adverse health impacts. Human exposure to toxic nanoparticles can be reduced through identifying creation-exposure pathways of toxins, a study that may someday soon unravel the mysteries of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Reduction in fossil fuel combustion would have a large impact on global human exposure to nanoparticles, as would limiting deforestation and desertification.While nanotoxicity is a relatively new concept to science, this review reveals the result of life's long history of evolution in the presence of nanoparticles, and how the human body, in particular, has adapted to defend itself against nanoparticulate intruders.","output":"Nanomaterials and nanoparticles: sources and toxicity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In traditional classroom education the teacher can easily perceive or obtain the engagements of the students by observing them.

METHODS: Blood samples were collected prospectively from adult patients presenting to the emergency department. Circulating levels of caspase-cleaved (apoptosis) and total cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) (total cell death) were determined using M30 and M65 enzyme assays, respectively. Intact CK-18 (necrosis) was estimated by subtracting M30 levels from M65. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients and 27 matched sick controls (with respiratory symptoms not due to COVID-19) were enrolled. Compared with sick controls, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p = 0.046, total cell death) and M30 (p = 0.0079, apoptosis). Hospitalised COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.014) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.004, necrosis) than discharged patients. Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.004), M30 (p= 0.004) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.033) than hospitalised non-ICU admitted patients.

Although natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is promising, it is not applicable to clinical practice thus far due to safety concerns. As a transitional procedure between standard laparoscopic surgery and NOTES, single-port transumbilical laparoscopic surgery might be an ideal alternative. The main advantage of single-port transumbilical laparoscopic surgery is that it is performed with existing instruments. Thus, we applied single-port surgery for cholecystectomies and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. METHODS Between July and October 2008, 37 adults with gallbladder pathologies were enrolled in this study. Only one transumbilical incision was made for accessing the abdominal cavity and a multichannel port system was assembled with existing devices. Standard laparoscopic instruments were used to perform the cholecystectomy. RESULTS There were 13 males and 24 females. The mean age of the patients was 47.5 +/- 12.2 years. Twenty-nine patients had gallbladder stones, 7 patients had gallbladder polyps, and 1 patient had biliary dyskinesia. The mean operative time was 83.6 +/- 40.2 minutes. Gallbladder perforations occurred in 11 patients. In 5 patients, the procedure was converted to a standard laparoscopic technique due to technical difficulties. Complications occurred in 2 patients; specifically, a mesenteric injury was caused by the inadvertent grasping of the small-bowel mesentery during the removal of the wound retractor and an inadvertent injury of the right hepatic duct. The mean hospital stay was 2.7 +/- 1.5 days. CONCLUSIONS Our series has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of single-port transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy. When technical difficulties arise, early conversion to a standard laparoscopic technique is advised to avoid serious complications. Additional studies randomizing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy and single-port transumbilical cholecystectomy are necessary for defining the exact role of this procedure.","output":"Single-port transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a preliminary study in 37 patients with gallbladder disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Building reliable phylogenies from very large collections of sequences with a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites is challenging because sequencing errors and recurrent/backward mutations interfere with the phylogenetic signal, confounding true evolutionary relationships. Massive global efforts of sequencing genomes and reconstructing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 strains exemplify these difficulties since there are only hundreds of phylogenetically informative sites and millions of genomes. For such datasets, we set out to develop a method for building the phylogenetic tree of genomic haplotypes consisting of positions harboring common variants to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate phylogenetic inference of resolvable phylogenetic features. RESULTS: We present the TopHap approach that determines spatiotemporally common haplotypes of common variants and builds their phylogeny at a fraction of the computational time of traditional methods. To assess topological robustness, we develop a bootstrap resampling strategy that resamples genomes spatiotemporally. The application of TopHap to build a phylogeny of 68,057 genomes (68KG) produced an evolutionary tree of major SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. This phylogeny is concordant with the mutation tree inferred using the co-occurrence pattern of mutations and recovers key phylogenetic relationships from more traditional analyses. We also evaluated alternative roots of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and found that the earliest sampled genomes in 2019 likely evolved by four mutations of the most recent common ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes. An application of TopHap to more than 1 million genomes reconstructed the most comprehensive evolutionary relationships of major variants, which confirmed the 68KG phylogeny and provided evolutionary origins of major variants of concern.","output":"TopHap: Rapid inference of key phylogenetic structures from common haplotypes in large genome collections with limited diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are a family of ion channels whose members are distributed among all kinds of animals, from invertebrates to vertebrates.

In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, small businesses have been exposed to serious risks, since their viability primarily depends on the consumer demand of the population, which in turn has declined sharply in these force majeure circumstances. Small businesses are either waiting for the lifting of restrictive measures, or they are counting on state support, or they are looking for other ways out of the current situation in order to preserve jobs, the level of income of employees, remain on the market and ensure the supply of vital goods and services to the population. Economic and social stability in the region and in the country as a whole largely depends on the ability of small businesses to assume these obligations. Description of the data or materials used. The study was conducted using the method of semi-formal interviews with owners of enterprises with a staff of up to one hundred people (small businesses). The experts surveyed included 17 small business entrepreneurs from seven Russian regions (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Omsk region (Omsk), Krasnodar territory (Anapa), Volgograd region (Cherepovets), Arkhangelsk region (Arkhangelsk), Kemerovo region (Jurga)) and by population (cities with millions of people, large and medium-sized cities). The surveyed entrepreneurs represented both industrial production and service companies. The interview was conducted using remote means of communication using a specially developed guide. The results of the study showed that the conditions of the pandemic forced small businesses to change the usual format of work, transform traditional business processes, and switch to remote customer service.

Main funding source(s): Dutch Olympic Committee*Dutch Sports Federation (NOC*NSF) Amsterdam Movement Sciences (AMS) ABSTRACT: Most studies investigating the cardiotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 focus on cardiac complications in severely ill patients. Little is known about eventual sustained cardiac involvement after recovery from COVID-19, especially in patients with a moderate or mild course of illness. Furthermore, as physical exercise can potentially worsen the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 peri- or myocarditis, cardiac involvement in athletes or in the physically active population warrants investigation. Finally, the risk of arrhythmias in such individuals remains largely unknown. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of myocardial and pericardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection, long-term cardiac sequelae after infection, and risks of SCD/SCD in a predominantly healthy/physical active population, including athletes. We performed a systematic PubMed and MedRxiv search through December 19th, 2020, with the combined terms or synonyms for: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cardiovascular imaging, cardiac MRI, athletes. Exclusion criteria were: no CMR investigations reported, 1 comorbidities, age 16 years, and reviews. Two investigators independently screened and assessed all identified manuscripts, and additionally searched for reported arrhythmia outcomes. The initial search yielded 127 papers; after extensive review, we included a total of nine papers comprising 607 recovered post-COVID patients/athletes. The table summarises the main CMR findings. No study reported arrhythmias except for Ho et al. who found 18% undefined arrhythmias at baseline. In 5 studies in 201 patients, the weighted mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 55%, elevated T2 48%, myocardial LGE 35%, and pericardial LGE 17%. One study (Knight et al.) did not report T1 and T2 measurements. Ho et al. and Ming-Yen et al. found respectively 40% and 19% of patients to meet the Lake Louise Criteria (LLC) for myocarditis; Puntmann et al. reported that 60% had active myocardial inflammation. Second, in 1 study in 139 healthcare workers, the mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 42%, T2 4%, LGE 30%, and 5% met LCC for myocarditis. Third, in 3 studies in 96 athletes, the weighted mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 21%, T2 24%, myocardial LGE 4%, and pericardial LGE 29%. Brito et al., Clark et al. and Rajpal et al. reported that respectively 0%, 5% and 15% met the LCC for myocarditis. Studies investigating peri- and myocardial sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection report varying prevalences of cardiac abnormalities. Such studies are limited in numbers, generally include a low number of individuals, and report no follow-up; only 1 study reported non-specified arrhythmia outcomes. Based on the available studies, the short-term risk for post-COVID-19 SCD due to arrhythmias caused by myocardial inflammation appears to be low. Prospective investigations in larger, well-defined populations, including longer-term follow up and arrhythmia monitoring, are urgently needed.","output":"Post corona infection cardiac abnormalities and the risk for sudden cardiac death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Escherichia coli bacteria are the most common causes of diarrhea and septicemia in calves. Moreover, calves form a major reservoir for transmission of pathogenic E. coli to humans. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) C VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea.

Disease severity is variable and it is unclear why certain groups of patients develop severe disease. Recent report suggests that 10% of patients with life threatening COVID-19 have auto-antibodies (AAbs) against type 1 interferons (IFN-1) but very few describe their impact in LTR. We therefore sought to identify AAbs in LTR with COVID-19 by using a customized proteomic microarray (CPM) bearing 120 antigens. Methods We retrieved samples collected for routine care within 3 months prior to and after diagnosis of COVID-19 of 13 LTR. IgA and IgG AAbs were analyzed using CPM. Predefined antibody score (ab-score) was used for downstream analysis. COVID severity was defined as per center for disease control guidelines. Changes in ab-scores from pre- to post-COVID were assessed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests;association between continuous variables and AAbs using Spearman's correlation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the association between changes in AAbs pre- to post-COVID and COVID severity. Results Among 13 LTR COVID severity was moderate (n=6), severe (n=4) and critical (n=3). Levels of 76 IgA antibodies and 9 IgG antibodies increased between pre and post covid samples (FDR adjusted p<0.05). In exploratory analysis, antibody response over time for one IgA antibody (IgA Nucleosome) and four IgG AAbs correlated with higher COVID severity (unadjusted p<0.05). IFN lambda is an antiviral cytokine and AAbs to it correlated with COVID severity (p=0.031). Such AAbs are shown to block the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. No significant differences were observed in antibody response in the groups who were alive (n=9) versus deceased (n=4) and three inflammatory markers, ferritin, D dimer and absolute lymphocyte count.

In addition, these reports may be subject to significant under-reporting due to a limited testing capacity of a country to identify suspect cases. This study estimated the number of seasonal excess deaths attributable to the COVID-19 epidemic in 31 provinces of Iran. Methods: We gathered the nationwide and provincial time series of the seasonal all-cause mortality data from spring 2015 to summer 2020 (21 March 2015 to 21 September 2020), in accordance with the Solar Hijri (SH) calendar, from the National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR). We estimated the expected number of seasonal deaths for each province using a piecewise linear regression model which we established based on the mortality figures for the previous years and considered any significant deviations from the expectation during winter, spring, and summer of 2020 to be directly associated with COVID-19. Results: Our analysis shows that from the start of winter to the end of summer (from 22 December 2019 to 21 September 2020), there were a total of 58.9K (95%CI: 46.9K - 69.5K) excess deaths across all 31 provinces with 27% (95%CI: 20% - 34%) estimated nationwide exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, 2 provinces in the central and northern Iran, namely Qom and Golestan, had the highest level of exposure with 57% (95%CI: 44% - 69%) and 56% (95%CI: 44% - 69%), respectively, while another 27 provinces had significant levels of excess mortality in at least one season with >20% population-level exposure to the virus.

RESULTS: Mortality for all adults of working age was similar to the annual average over the previous 5 years. Monthly excess mortality peaked in April, when the number of deaths was 54.2% higher than expected and was lowest in December when deaths were 30.0% lower than expected.Essential workers had consistently higher excess mortality than other groups throughout 2020. There were also large differences in excess mortality between the categories of essential workers, with healthcare workers having the highest excess mortality and social care and education workers having the lowest. Excess mortality also varied widely between men and women, even within the same occupational group. Generally, excess mortality was higher in men. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, excess mortality was consistently higher for essential workers throughout 2020, particularly for healthcare workers. Further research is needed to examine excess mortality by occupational group, while controlling for important confounders such as ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

In contrast, 32/193 (17%) pwCF were able to increase their PA levels: 12 (38%) and 11 (34%) reported undertaking home-based training and outdoor activities more frequently; 6 (19%) reported an increase in routine PA, and another 3 (9%) started new activities. Among pwCF without LTX, 5% and 4% reported to undertake less airway clearance and inhalation therapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals unfavorable consequences of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on PA of pwCF with unknown long-term consequences for their overall physical fitness and lung health. Strategies to overcome this undesirable situation are needed; increased uptake of telehealth PA programs and virtual exercise classes to promote PA participation might be one promising approach along with vaccination of pwCF and their close contacts.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic restrictions continuously impact on physical activity in adults with cystic fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airbnb, which launched its business in 2009, has experienced explosive growth by creating value through the sharing economy business model.

Emotions and confidence are important factors in the career decision-making process. This process of choosing a specific direction towards a career often opens students to many uncertain situations, leading them to stress and anxiety. Emotional intelligence and generalized self-efficacy facilitate students in effective career decision-making by coping with difficulties during academia. The present study aimed to find the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) on career decision-making (CDM) and generalized self-efficacy (GSE) among university students in China. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 310 undergraduate students from different universities of China. A cross-sectional research design was used and a convenient sampling technique was utilized. For the present study, Wong and Law emotional intelligence, generalized self-efficacy, and career decision-making difficulties scales were utilized. RESULTS: Findings of the study show that there is a significant relationship between EI, GSE, and career decision-making difficulties. Results revealed a significant positive relationship of GSE with emotional intelligence. GSE has a significant negative relationship with career decision-making difficulties. Moreover, EI has a significant negative relationship with career decision-making difficulties. CONCLUSION: The study will help students to utilize emotional intelligence skills during academic and vocational life.

We propose a theoretical framework that links trust, trustworthiness and inequality. The key feature is that agents do not necessarily observe the entire income distribution but base their assessment on reference groups (i.e. they might hold a biased view of reality). In this framework the negative impact of inequality on interpersonal trust is related to the individual-specific perception of inequality. This has important implications for the empirical analyses since researchers typically do not observe perceptions but only objective measures of inequality (e.g. the Gini coefficient). We show that the use of the latter is appropriate only under restrictive assumptions and in general will result in an underestimation of the true effect. An unbiased estimate of the effect of inequality on trust can be obtained with a measure of individual-specific perceptions of inequality. Survey data support our framework. Perceptions of higher inequality exert a strong negative effect on trust.

METHODS Province X and province Z with large difference on the timing to include icotinib in medical insurance were selected as sample provinces to compare and analyze the price, volume and expenditure changes of three targeted drugs (gefitinib, erlotinib and icotinib) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using the sample hospital procurement data covering two provinces from 2013 to 2018 in the China Medical Economic Information Network (CMEI) database. RESULTS In two sample provinces, icotinib's daily cost had been the lowest among three sample drug's for a long time. Province Z has included icotinib in the basic health insurance since 2013. After that, the market shares of icotinib's volume and expenditure had increased rapidly from 0, and remained at about 85% for a long period of time, occupying the dominant position in province Z's market. However, province X has not included icotinib until 2016. The highest market share of icotinib's volume was only 8% in province X's market. There was little difference of sample drugs' daily cost between two provinces. After the national health insurance negotiation, the daily cost of sample drugs decreased significantly, with an overall decrease between 60% to 79%. By the second half of 2018, the daily cost of sample drugs was almost the same. CONCLUSION Timely inclusion of high-quality domestic innovative drugs in the scope of medical insurance reimbursement can greatly promote the use of high-quality domestic innovative drugs. Compared with foreign drugs with same indications, high-quality domestic innovative drugs can save money for patients, which will greatly benefit them.","output":"Case Study of Icotinib on The Impact of Domestic Innovative Drugs Timely Covered by Medical Insurance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nutrient timing involves manipulation of nutrient consumption at specific times in and around exercise bouts in an effort to improve performance, recovery, and adaptation. Its historical perspective centered on ingestion during exercise and grew to include pre- and post-training periods. As research continued, translational focus remained primarily on the impact and outcomes related to nutrient consumption during one specific time period to the exclusion of all others. Additionally, there seemed to be increasing emphasis on outcomes related to hypertrophy and strength at the expense of other potentially more impactful performance measures. As consumption of nutrients does not occur at only one time point in the day, the effect and impact of energy and macronutrient availability becomes an important consideration in determining timing of additional nutrients in and around training and competition. This further complicates the confining of the definition of nutrient timing to one very specific moment in time at the exclusion of all other time points. As such, this review suggests a new perspective built on evidence of the interconnectedness of nutrient impact and provides a pragmatic approach to help frame nutrient timing more inclusively. Using this approach, it is argued that the concept of nutrient timing is constrained by reliance on interpretation of an anabolic window and may be better viewed as a garage door of opportunity to positively impact performance, recovery, and athlete availability.","output":"Nutrient Timing: A Garage Door of Opportunity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 pose significant challenges to public transportation Several recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the high risk of transmission among passengers on public buses if special precautions are not taken This study presents a combined experimental and numerical analysis to identify transmission mechanisms on an urban bus and assess strategies to reduce risk The effects of the ventilation and air-conditioning systems, opening windows and doors, and wearing masks are analyzed Specific attention is paid to the transport of submicron- and micron-sized particles relevant to typical respiratory droplets High-resolution instrumentation was used to measure size distribution and aerosol response time on a campus bus of the University of Michigan under these different conditions Computational fluid dynamics was employed to measure the airflow within the bus and evaluate risk A risk metric was adopted based on the number of particles exposed to susceptible passengers The flow that carries these aerosols is predominantly controlled by the ventilation system, which acts to uniformly distribute the aerosol concentration throughout the bus while simultaneously diluting it with fresh air The opening of doors and windows was found to reduce the concentration by approximately one half, albeit its benefit does not uniformly impact all passengers on the bus due to the recirculation of airflow caused by entrainment through windows Finally, it was found that well fitted surgical masks, when worn by both infected and susceptible passengers, can nearly eliminate the transmission of the disease ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Disease transmission through expiratory aerosols on an urban bus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health and pandemic ethics frequently concern themselves with organizing principles, utility, and public policy.

By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination. At 3C8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting. Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem. The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis. MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis. These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease. This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination.","output":"Late onset, symptomatic, demyelinating encephalomyelitis in mice infected with MHV-JHM in the presence of maternal antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The risk of congenital infections in neonates born to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected mothers and those breastfed by infected mothers remains largely unknown. Objective To describe the outcomes and clinical features of neonates born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, to follow up neonates who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of delivery for a period of 1 month, and to identify potential risk factors associated with disease transmission. Methods This prospective observational study on neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers between June 2020 and January 2021 was carried out after getting written informed consent in a tertiary care government hospital (Government Medical college Kannur, North Kerala, India). The clinical and demographic characteristics of infected mothers were reviewed. Neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection within 24 hours of birth, with repeat testing on day 5 for those who were negative at birth. The demographic and clinical characteristics as well as potential risk factors for disease transmission in these neonates were evaluated. Results A total of 342 neonates (95.3%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at birth. Rooming-in and breastfeeding was practiced in 75% of at-risk neonates. Fifty neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at birth (14.3%);293 neonates who tested negative at birth remained so on day 5, except one baby isolated with a caretaker who also tested positive, indicating postnatal infection. There was no statistically significant increased risk of infection in neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers compared to those born to mothers who had already become negative at delivery. Mild symptoms were present in 8% of positive neonates. On one-month follow up, all neonates were well and gaining weight. Conclusion Vertical transmission, in particular trans-placental, may be possible in SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers. Maternal infection at the time of delivery is not a predictor for increased vertical transmission compared to mothers whose infections had resolved prior to delivery.

There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. METHODS: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.","output":"Individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccination in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Primary health care delivery in the developing world faces many challenges.

The link to the survey was shared in different social networking platforms between 6th and 22nd of April 2020. The questionnaire collected responses related to the sociodemographic variables, exposure history, precautionary measures used, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) score. Results A total of 541 participants responded to the questionnaire. Only 422 respondents' responses from 23 states of India who completed the questionnaire were included for assessment. The mean age of the participants was 30.5 (SD=10.9) years. Female constituted 60.4% (n=255) of the respondents. The pre-existing medical illness that the respondents had were diabetes mellitus, four per cent (n=17), hypertension, five per cent (n=21), thyroid dysfunction, nine per cent (n=38), and mental illness, five per cent (n=21). The median (IQR) of the DASS-21 item scale was found to be 16 (4-32). The percentage of the respondents who reported stress was 35.5% (n=149), anxiety, 32% (n=135), and depression, 34.7% (n=146). Respondents with sociodemographic variables like being single, student status, competed education till graduation, homemakers, working in public sector, and history of mental illness were more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. A majority of the respondents were practicing hand hygiene and social distancing. Respondents who were unaware of their exposure status were more likely to have depression. Conclusion The Indian population is experiencing the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may increase with the spread of the infection. India needs to gear up to face mental health consequences. People with a pre-existing physical and psychological illness needs extra care and precaution to prevent any relapse or development of complications.","output":"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risk factors during the initial stage among the general population in India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of three diagnostic tests for the detection of Campylobacter fetus venerealis (Cfv) using field samples were estimated using a Bayesian latent class model (BLCM), accounting for the absence of a gold standard. The tests included in this study were direct immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Twelve farms from two different populations were selected and bull prepuce samples were collected. The IFAT was performed according to the OIE Manual. The conventional PCR was performed as multiplex, targeting the gene nahE for C. fetus species identification and insertion element ISCfe1 for Cfv identification. The RT-PCR was performed as uniplex: one targeting the gene nahE for C. fetus and the other targeting the insertion ISCfe1 (ISC2) for Cfv. Results from the BLCM showed a median Se of 11.7% (Bayesian credibility interval (BCI): 1.93C29.79%), 53.7% (BCI: 23.1C95.0%), and 36.1% (BCI: 14.5C71.7%) for IFAT, PCR, and RT-PCR respectively. The Sp were 94.5% (BCI: 90.1C97.9%), 97.0% (BCI: 92.9C99.3%), and 98.4% (BCI: 95.3C99.7%) for IFAT, PCR, and RT-PCR respectively. The correlation between PCR and RT-PCR was positive and low in samples from both sampled population (0.63% vs 8.47%).

The RLR for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in three 20-year periods were assessed using data from a single community-based cohort study of predominantly White participants. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Framingham study in 3 epochs (epoch 1, 1960-1979; epoch 2, 1980-1999; epoch 3, 2000-2018) were evaluated. The RLR of a first ASCVD event (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or stroke) from 45 years of age (adjusting for competing risk of death) in the 3 epochs were compared overall, and according to the following strata: sex, body mass index, blood pressure and cholesterol categories, diabetes, smoking, and Framingham risk score groups. RESULTS: There were 317 849 person-years of observations during the 3 epochs (56% women; 94% White) and 4855 deaths occurred. Life expectancy rose by 10.1 years (men) to 11.9 years (women) across the 3 epochs. There were 1085 ASCVD events over the course of 91 330 person-years in epoch 1, 1330 ASCVD events over the course of 107 450 person-years in epoch 2, and 775 ASCVD events over the course of 119 069 person-years in epoch 3. The mean age at onset of first ASCVD event was greater in the third epoch by 8.1 years (men) to 10.3 years (women) compared with the first epoch. The RLR of ASCVD from 45 years of age declined from 43.7% in epoch 1 to 28.1% in epoch 3 (P<0.0001), a finding that was consistent in both sexes (RLR [epoch 1 versus epoch 3], 36.3% versus 26.5% [women]; 52.5% versus 30.1% [men]; P<0.001 for both). The lower RLR of ASCVD in the last 2 epochs was observed consistently across body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and Framingham risk score strata (P<0.001 for all). The RLR of coronary heart disease events and stroke declined in both sexes (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 6 decades, mean life expectancy increased and the RLR of ASCVD decreased in the community-based, predominantly White Framingham study. The residual burden of ASCVD underscores the importance of continued and effective primary prevention efforts with better screening for risk factors and their effective treatment.","output":"Temporal Trends in the Remaining Lifetime Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Among Middle-Aged Adults Across 6 Decades: The Framingham Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the pandemic, to date, around 180 million cases have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide with an estimated 3.9 million death toll.

However, the adverse events associated with vaccination have not been fully investigated. Of concern are some serious cardiovascular events such as myocarditis, pericarditis or perimyocarditis development post-vaccination. In this report, we present an unusual case of acute perimyocarditis and pericardial effusion 10 days following the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination in Qatar. At the time of presentation, the patient presented with non-specific symptoms of headache, diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy and dehydration. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Once admitted to the emergency department, she started to deteriorate with very low blood pressure readings reaching 40/33 mmHg which was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. After 5.5 liters of intravenous fluids, echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. Findings were consistent with pericardial effusion, signs of impending cardiac tamponade and acute perimyocarditis. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were elevated. Hospital course was complicated with cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemodynamic instability. Eventually, the patient recovered after a three-week hospital stay and was discharged on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs).

The construction of these hospitals can be considered as the concrete expression of a therapeutic innovation which recognized insanity as an illness that could be treated in such specialised institutions. The spatial diffusion of these innovative institutions through 19th and 20th century France is analysed and we explore how far this can be understood through theories of diffusion of innovations including geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion (or whether other conceptual models are more appropriate). The research reported here particularly focuses on the period 1800C1961. It involved the construction of an original historical database of both psychiatric hospitals and information on the cities where these institutions were located. This was used to examine and interpret the different phases of development of psychiatric institutions and the parts of the country and types of geographical setting where they were concentrated. A multiple correspondence analysis was then performed to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process. The study shows the limitations of classical models of spatial diffusion, which are found to be consistent with some, but not all aspects of the development of psychiatric institutions in France. An alternative political ecology approach seems more appropriate to conceptualise the various processes involved; national policies, social representations, medicalisation of care of mental illness, and urban and economic growth all seem to be associated with the emergence of a variable and complex pattern. This paper also opens a large field of research. Compared with other western countries, the geography of French psychiatric care is relatively under-researched, although there has been a strong spatial dimension to mental health policy in the country. This analysis provides a context for studies of more contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation, which is strongly structured by the past heritage of these large asylum facilities.","output":"The geography of institutional psychiatric care in France 1800C2000: Historical analysis of the spatial diffusion of specialised facilities for institutional care of mental illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a case study focusing on conceptualizing uncertainties that three groups of high school students and their English teacher have articulated during the re-organization of their teaching and learning due to the COVID19 pandemic.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted among Israeli adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB predictor variables as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R squared = 0.78). Men (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

We studied the clinicopathological characteristics of DPAs with different pathological types and conducted long-term follow-up to explore its prognosis and identify methods for appropriate clinical management of DPAs. METHODS: In total, 95 DPA cases confirmed by postoperative pathology were enrolled, of which 58 underwent endoscopic papillectomy (EP) and 37 underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The cases were classified into three anatomical and two histomorphological types according to the histopathology and location of endoscopic features. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics of DPAs with different pathological types and investigated the factors associated with recurrence in the EP subgroup. RESULTS: Although EP was associated with fewer adverse events, the complete resection rate was significantly lower (72.4% vs. 100.0%, p < 0.001) and the recurrence rate significantly higher than with PD (16.3% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001). Among eight EP cases with recurrence, six had intra-DPA (75%). A positive resection margin (HR 23.67, 95% CI 6.42-87.27; p < 0.001) and MUC2-negative status (HR 3.47, 95% CI 1.16-10.40; p = 0.026) were independent risk factors for recurrence after EP. CONCLUSION: We identified different pathological types within DPAs, which presented varying clinicopathological features. The majority of peri-DPAs and mixed-DPAs were of the intestinal type histologically and EP is the primary recommendation. However, intra-DPA was mainly of the pancreaticobiliary type, which tends to get positive resection margins; thus, surgical resection is more suitable.","output":"Indicative value of pathological classification of duodenal papillary adenomas in clinical diagnosis and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to analyze the anatomical structures relevant for endodontic microsurgery in the mandibular posterior teeth using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 963 mandibular posterior teeth were analyzed in CBCT scans from 133 patients. The buccolingual and mesiodistal dimensions of the root and the buccal bone thickness overlying the root were measured at the site of root resection (apical 3 mm). At this location, the relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root was classified into three types (separated, contact, and exposed), and the distance from the root apex to the mandibular canal was measured. RESULTS The thickest buccolingual dimension of the roots was found in the mesial roots of first molars, at 5.59  0.97 mm. The buccal bone thickness overlying the root became thicker in posterior tooth locations. In the first premolar and first molar mesial root, contact was the most common type of relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root. As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the distance from the apex to the mandibular canal became shorter. CONCLUSIONS As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the buccal bone thickness increased and the distance to the mandibular canal became closer; therefore, particular attention is required for posterior teeth. The first premolar and the first molar mesial root are often in contact with the buccal cortical bone, which may allow infections to spread to the buccal structure more easily and negatively affect for post-surgical healing.

A wide range of clinical specimens has been used to detect SARS-CoV-2. However, to date, a consensus has not been reached regarding the most appropriate specimens to use for viral RNA detection in assessing COVID-19 patients for discharge.

In this retrospective longitudinal study of viral RNA detection in 60 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we used saliva, oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab (O/N swab) and anal swab procedures from admission to discharge. The conversion times of saliva and anal swab were longer than that of O/N swab. The conversion time of hyper sensitive-CRP was the shortest and correlated with that of CT scanning and viral detection. Some patients were found to be RNA-positive in saliva while RNA-negative in anal swab while the reverse was true in some other patients, which indicated that false negatives were inevitable if only the anal swab is used for evaluating suitability for discharge. These results indicated that double-checking for viral RNA using multiple and diverse specimens was essential, and saliva could be a candidate to supplement anal swabs to reduce false-negative results and facilitate pandemic control.","output":"Saliva specimen complements anal swab in assessing patients with COVID-19 for discharge from hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real\\\\world evidence (RWE) is an emerging scientific discipline which is being increasingly utilized for decision making on prescription\\\\only medicines.

Next, MCP-1-overexpression plasmid and small interfering RNA were transfected into human and rat FLSs. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell migration and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis of FLSs following MCP-1 transfections, respectively. Furthermore, western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of p-P38, p-PI3K, PI3K, CD31, VEGF, TNF- and IL- in FLSs following MCP-1 transfection. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and ELISAs were used to analyze the expression levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), estrogen receptor, MCP-1 and pentraxin-3 in patients with clinical RA, followed by correlation analysis of clinical data. Finally, expression validation, diagnostic and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of MCP-1 were performed. RESULTS: MCP-1 promoted FLS proliferation and migration, and affected the apoptosis of FLSs. In addition, the expression levels of p-P38, p-PI3K, PI3K, CD31, VEGF, TNF- and IL- were also affected by MCP-1. In patients with clinical RA, the expression level of MCP-1 was increased. Moreover, CRP expression level was significantly up-regulated in RA. Clinically, MCP-1 was strongly correlated with tender joint count, swollen joint count, visual analog scale for general health and disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-MCP-1, and was moderately correlated with DAS28 and DAS28-CRP.

Therefore, the result will be beneficial to design strategies for prioritizing maternal healthcare even with the COVID-19 pandemic period. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2 to August 30, 2020 among pregnant women attending ANC services at public hospitals in Northeast Ethiopia. Thus, a total of 389 women were included in the study with a simple random sampling technique. The bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression models were employed to identify factors significantly associated with ANC utilization. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI was estimated to show the strength of association. Finally, a P-value of <0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of antenatal care utilization. RESULTS: Overall, 114 (29.3%) pregnant women had fully utilized antenatal care services during the pandemic period. Mother age 35 years (AOR=11.79, 95% CI=1.18C 117.8), secondary education and above (AOR=4.74, 95% CI=1.04C 21.61), history of stillbirth before recent pregnancy (AOR=0.007, 95% CI=0.001C0.12), interruption and diversion of services due to COVID-19 response (AOR=0.675, 95% CI=0.142C0.742), fear of COVID-19 (AOR=0.13, 95% CI=0.06C0.31), and lack of transport access (AOR=4.15, 95% CI=1.04C16.54) were predictors of full antenatal care service utilization. CONCLUSION: Three of every ten pregnant women who attended the obstetric outpatient clinics have fully utilized the antenatal care services.

METHODS Subjects were recruited and classified into one of the following four groups: normal controls (n = 52), diabetes without DR (n = 49), non-proliferative DR (n = 51) and proliferative DR (n = 38). Using OCTA, the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the choriocapillaris vessel densities were measured and compared in different macular areas: the fovea (1-mm diameter circular area), parafovea (1-3-mm diameter ring) and perifovea (3-6-mm ring). RESULTS With DR progression, vessel densities in the SCP and DCP as well as the choriocapillaris decreased, while the foveal avascular zone area increased (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with controls, the SCP and DCP vessel densities of the diabetes without DR group were decreased in all areas of the macula (p < 0.020 for all), while the choriocapillaris vessel density was decreased only in the perifoveal area (p = 0.823 for the foveal area; p = 0.631 for the parafoveal area; p = 0.039 for the perifoveal area). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that all retinal and choroidal microvascular indices were significantly associated with the DR severity.

We explored the manifestations and formation mechanism of the problem of insufficient resilience in community public health crisis governance, based on the complex adaptive system theory, which emphasizes interaction among subjects and between subjects and the environment to improve the adaptability to the environment. Questionnaires and in-depth interviews were conducted in 28 counties (districts) of 14 cities of 7 provinces in China; 2345 questionnaires and 71 interview data were collected, and we conducted descriptive statistical analysis on questionnaire data. It is found that some communities faced insufficient resilience problems such as simply isolating households and communities, blindly setting limits, layer-by-layer law, and rejecting and repelling all individuals from or even related to Hubei. These problems are due to the fact that the community have a non-interactive relationship, which is a one-dimensional linear governance model to some extent. The legal content of the building of a comprehensive disaster-reduction demonstration community implemented by the Chinese government is compelled to stay at the level of system design to some extent, with its existence playing an ornamental role but lacking a substantial one.

Unfortunately, there is still no sign that the epidemic spread is slowing down. China, as the first country suffering from the widespread outbreak of the epidemic, has effectively contained the spread of the epidemic since March, 2020. Therefore, confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 20 to March 18, 2020 were taken as the sample set to establish the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. The model was used to analyze changes in the numbers of individuals becoming infected, exposed (latently infected), susceptible, and recovered in the experimental groups taking different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and in the control group not taking any NPIs, so as to evaluate effects of different NPIs. By doing so, the research expects to provide references to other countries for formulating corresponding policies. The results show that type-A NPIs for reducing daily contacts with infected and exposed cases and type-B NPIs for decreasing the probability of post-exposure infections both can delay the timing of large-scale infections of the susceptible population, timing of the number of exposed individuals to peak, and timing of peaking of the number of infected cases, as well as decrease the peak number of exposed cases. Moreover, type-B NPIs have more significant effects on susceptible and exposed populations. Type-C NPIs for improving the recovery rate of patients are able to effectively reduce the peak number of patients, greatly decrease the slope of the curve for the number of infected cases, substantially improve the recovery rate, and lower the mortality rate;however, these NPIs do not greatly delay the timing of the number of infected cases to peak. In addition to these, considering effects of different NPIs on the susceptible and exposed populations and in delaying the timing for the number of infected cases to peak, it is found that the governments organization of medical supply related companies to resume production exerts the best effect. As for reducing the epidemic number of patients in the core epidemic area (CEA, Hubei Province), delivery and putting-into-operation of Leishenshan hospital shows the best effect, followed by dispatching of medical staff to support Wuhan, delivery and putting-into-operation of Huoshenshan hospital, and construction of mobile cabin hospitals.","output":"Effect evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions taken in China to contain the COVID-19 epidemic based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A satisfied employee is an asset for any organization to produce good results.

The aim of this investigation was the evaluation of female representation at a large, national urological meeting. Materials & Methods: The program of the annual meetings of 2011, 2018, 2019 and the virtual conference in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic has been retrospectively quantified by gender and categorized by chair or speaker, type, and topic of the session. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis has been performed to identify gender inequity and variables influencing gender distribution. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 2.504 chairs and speakers have been invited in 2018 and 2019. Female speakers or chairs were represented in 17.8%, indicating a gender gap of 64.7%. There was a total of 114 (14.6%) female chairs without significant differences between both years in 2018 and 2019 respectively [14.2% vs. 14.9%;p=0.772] and 331 (19.2%) female speakers with significant more women in 2019 [16.4% vs. 22.1%;p=0.003]. There were significant differences between session type, topic, and gender distribution for chairs and speakers, respectively. The topic surgical techniques was an independent variable for both, underrepresented female chairs and speakers, respectively (p<0.001).

However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates. Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans. We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto. Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses. We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup. In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95% CI: 185.4C271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95%: 30.7C299.7).

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n = 56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effect regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally across several months. RESULTS: A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing.

However, the agricultural sector is facing numerous challenges such as climate change, widespread insecurity, price volatility, poor government policies and the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the already existing problems. This paper reviews the state of the COVID 19 pandemic in Nigeria and its effects on the agricultural sector and outlines the role of commissioners of agriculture in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on farmers with a view to catalyzing sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. When the first case of COVID-19 was reported in February, 2020, the Federal government of Nigeria took some measures to help curb the spread of the virus. Although, these measures were critical to saving lives, they also significantly caused a disruption in agricultural activities and food systems in several ways such as decline in availability of farm labour and mechanization, limited availability of agricultural inputs, decline in food imports and exports, reduction in food supply, decline in household income and food consumption, increased food insecurity, panic buying and sharp price spikes. This paper suggests that commissioners of agriculture have important roles to play to help mitigate these negative impacts on agricultural livelihoods and food systems. These include a push for a bill to integrate social protection mechanisms into the Nigerian legal framework, lobby for increased budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector, formulation of good agricultural policies and provision of adequate infrastructures, organization of these farmers into farming clusters to help stimulate agglomeration economies by integrating agricultural value chains and development strategies, and frameworks and initiatives that will ensure a seamless transition from emergency response to resilience building.","output":"Mitigating COVID-19 effects on farmers: the role of commissioners of agriculture in Nigeria.

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of perinatal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for mminimising viral transmission. Overall, 91 pregnant women in labour, or with indication for induction of labour, with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. On the day of admission, each pregnant woman underwent a nasopharyngeal swab to validate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whenever delivery was by caesarean section, an amniotic fluid sample was collected after uterus incision. Neonates were tested twice: first by nasopharyngeal swab at birth and secondly either at 24 h after (when babies were isolated) or at discharge (when rooming-in). All samples underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests by nasopharyngeal swab of the pregnant women produced positive results in 47 patients. This cohort gave birth to 48 infants who were double tested by nasopharyngeal swab and included in the prospective observational study. Moreover, in this same cohort, 39 amniotic fluid samples were taken during caesarean section. All samples underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and came back negative.

Several studies have recently been published on the impact of COVID-19-related loneliness among older populations, but little has been written about the experiences of already-lonely older individuals; those that had lived with persistent loneliness before the advent of COVID-19. This qualitative study sought to understand how already lonely older individuals navigated and endured the social isolation of the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals aged 65 or older who scored a 6 or above on the three-item UCLA Loneliness Risk screening tool. Interviews were coded using the constant comparative method. Themes and understandings of loneliness that reoccurred within and across interviews were identified and collected. RESULTS: Already-isolated, older interviewees did not necessarily experience the abject loneliness hypothesized by analysts. Most interviewees used long-standing arrangements, in place to mitigate loneliness and endure social isolation, to manage the social deprivation of COVID-19. As a result, their loneliness did not compound during long bouts of mandated social isolation. To the contrary, loneliness during the pandemic appeared to carry a new valence for interviewees, as COVID-19 imbued their isolation with new meaning, rendering their loneliness necessary and responsible. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Exploring individuals' subjective perceptions of loneliness can help provide a deeper understanding of what it means to be isolated and alone during COVID-19, and aid in designing strategies to mitigate loneliness.","output":"The Lived Experience of Already-Lonely Older Adults During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advances in the metagenomics field have had huge effects on the identification and characterization of newly emerging viral pathogens.

Except for lung injury, it is possible that COVID-19 patients develop liver injury. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched. The incidence of abnormal liver biochemical tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin (ALB), was pooled. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated to explore the association of abnormal liver biochemical tests with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included. The pooled incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission and during hospitalization was 27.2% and 36%, respectively. Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed at admission, abnormal ALB was the most common, followed by GGT, AST, ALT, TBIL, and ALP (39.8%, 35.8%, 21.8%, 20.4%, 8.8%, and 4.7%). Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed during hospitalization, abnormal ALT was more common than AST and TBIL (38.4%, 28.1%, and 23.2%). Severe and/or critical patients had a significantly higher pooled incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators at admission than mild and/or moderate patients. Non-survivors had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators than survivors (RR = 1.34, p = 0.04).

These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.","output":"Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a systematic review of the literature specifically aimed to explore myocardial injury in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients who were hospitalized with severe complicated infections.

Blood samples were collected from 21 healthy Holstein cows at 5, 10, 14, and 21 d postpartum. Serum samples were used to measure concentrations of total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, urea, glucose, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin (Hp), -hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and insulin-like growth factor-1. The shift of percentage of activated neutrophils for phagocytosis (PPC) and oxidative burst (POB) and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for PC (MFIPC), OB (MFIOB), and endocytic and proteolytic degradation measured via DQ-ovalbumin (MFIDQ) were evaluated using flow cytometry. Mixed linear regression models were used to assess the associations of serum concentrations of metabolites and blood neutrophil counts with each neutrophil function assay outcome accounting for d postpartum, parity, and body condition score. Pearson correlation tests (r) were used to describe the relationships of metabolites and neutrophil counts with neutrophil function assays that were significant in the regression models. Greater serum concentrations of Hp were associated with lesser OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = -0.2 for both), but greater PPC and MFIDQ (r = 0.3 for both). Greater serum NEFA and cholesterol were associated with lesser (r = -0.3) and greater (r = 0.2) POB function, respectively. Blood neutrophil counts were associated with PPC (r = -0.2) and MFIDQ (r = -0.3). At 5 d postpartum, greater serum total protein was associated with greater OB function (POB and MFIOB; r = 0.4 for both). Other markers were not associated with neutrophil function. Some metabolic and inflammatory markers in healthy postpartum dairy cows were associated with circulating neutrophil function. However, these associations only explained a small proportion of the variance in neutrophil function. Serum Hp concentration was most associated with neutrophil function changes but had opposite directions of association with OB- and PC-related functions.

In this study, we evaluate 3 systems of allocation for V-V ECMO in both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 3 systems of ECMO allocation (MN, MDH, and OHI) across 4 ECMO Centers of Excellence. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the scores and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Cut points for priority groups were evaluated by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. Results: Of 124 patients, 38% were treated for COVID-19 ARDS. The median age was 48 years and 73% were male. The in-hospital mortality rate was 38% and increased to 42% at 30 days.

METHODS: Based on the sixth Standard Occupational Classification codes, 2015 census data were linked with data from the fifth Korean Working Conditions Survey, which measured how frequently workers directly come into contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace. RESULTS: A total of 30 occupational groups, including 7 occupations from the healthcare and welfare sectors and 23 from other sectors, were classified as high-risk occupational groups involving frequent contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace (more than half of the working hours). Approximately 1.4 million (women, 79.1%) and 10.7 million workers (46.3%) are employed in high-risk occupations. Occupations with a larger proportion of women are more likely to be at a high-risk of infection and are paid less. For wage-earners in high-risk occupations, protective resources to deal with COVID-19 (e.g., trade unions and health and safety committees) are less prevalent among temporary or daily workers than among those with permanent employment.

The political process is often seen as integral to bringing about change, largely due to orthodox understandings of the nature of law, in which law is made by parliaments and capable of revision in only limited instances. In recent years, theorists such as Bruno Latour (2013, 2009), Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (2015) and Serge Gutwirth (2015) have taken a more expansive view of the nature of law and its effects. According to these theorists, law also emerges from outside the political process, including through various practices such as those of professionals working within legal systems, and those engaged in resistance, navigation and subversion (Seear 2020). This article explores these processes using Karen Barad's (2015) work on lightning. As we will explain, Barad presents lightning as a queer, non-linear, uncertain and indeterminate phenomenon, using it to understand causation in new ways. Along with Barad's ideas, the article draws on interview data (N = 35) collected for two research projects in Canada. These interviews were conducted with senior drug use-related policy makers, service providers, advocates and lawyers based in British Columbia and Ontario, Canada. The interviews explore how key Canadian experts view drug law, debates about law and policy and whether they support reform. We also explore how these experts navigate the criminalisation of drugs and whether any insights can be drawn from their practices, including their attempts to navigate, subvert or change the law. First we consider experts concern about current prohibitionist legal frameworks, finding it widespread, along with appetite for change. Second, we examine experts accounts of strategies used for working around or challenging punitive frameworks. We find that change, like lightning, is complicated and messy; simplistic approaches to changes are not always possible, and may in fact make matters worse. There are multiple, unpredictable effects in engaging and resisting law, and thus difficulty in tackling criminalisation in any clear and simple way. Practices and processes of responding to and resisting drug-use criminalisation can thus be understood in terms that reflect the queer, indeterminate, unpredictable and multidirectional nature of Barad's lightning. In concluding, we note that this way of understanding legal processes and resistance has implications for the future of Canadian drug policy, including debates about whether it is possible to work within a framework of overarching criminalisation.","output":"A highly charged field: Mapping energies, currents and desires for reform in Canadian expert responses to drug law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article sought to understand public perceptions on city landscaping during the outbreak of COVID-19 The research aimed to discuss the theoretical aspects related to restrictions on travel during the pandemic and city landscaping and to conduct an empirical study of experiences of the Vilnius Pop-up Beach, Lithuania The thematic analysis selected for the empirical study is not limited and flexible, allowing for revealing the experiences and public opinion, including that expressed in the media, relating to the Vilnius Pop-up Beach The analysis resulted in the identification of several themes: \\"Nostalgia for heroic landscape\\", \\"Changing memory landscape\\", and \\"Enjoying the landscape of freedom\\", which demonstrated the controversy surrounding the changing city landscape Analysis showed the interaction of public perceptions on city landscaping The results of this research highlight the importance in future sustainable landscape development of paying attention to the different city experiences Public perceptions should be heard and respected when considering the unique landscape of the past, present, and future and its impact on city memories Thus, possible directions for future research should include more in-depth explorations on alternative travel experiences, looking for possible uncovered, unforeseen, sensitive, and meaningful travel experiences, which emerged during the outbreak of COVID-19","output":"Public Perceptions on City Landscaping during the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease: The Case of Vilnius Pop-Up Beach, Lithuania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A lateral flow assay (LFA) is a paper-based, point-of-need test designed to detect a specific analyte in complex samples in low-resource settings. Although LFA has been successfully used in different applications, its use is still limited when high sensitivity is required, especially in the diagnosis of an early-stage condition. The limit of detection (LOD) is clearly related to the signal-generating system used to achieve the visual readout, in many cases involving nanoparticles coupled to a biomolecule, which, when combined, provides sensitivity and specificity, respectively. While colloidal gold is currently the most-used label, other detection systems are being developed. Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) demonstrate outstanding features to improve the sensitivity of this technology by producing an increased contrast in the paper background. Based on the necessity of sensitivity improvement, the aim of this work is a comparative study, in terms of analytical performance, between commercial streptavidin gold nanoparticles (streptAv-AuNPs) and avidin carbon nanoparticles (Av-CNPs) in a nucleic acid lateral flow assay. The visual LOD of the method was calculated by serial dilution of the DNA template, ranging from 0.0 to 7 pg L(?1)/1.5  10(4) CFU mL(?1)). The LFA achieved visual detection of as low as 2.2  10(?2) pg L(?1) using Av-CNPs and 8.4  10(?2) pg L(?1) using streptAv-AuNPs. These LODs could be obtained without the assistance of any instrumentation. The results demonstrate that CNPs showed an increased sensitivity, achieving the nanomolar range even by visual inspection.

Regional variation in internet access and telehealth use are well-documented, but the effect of neighborhood factors, including the pervasiveness of broadband internet, on older adults' telehealth usage in the context of internet access is not known. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how individual and neighborhood characteristics, including the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription, are associated with engagement in telehealth among older adults with internet access. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 5117 community-living older adults aged &#8805;65 years, who participated in the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study with census tract-level data for participants' places of residence from the American Community Survey. RESULTS: Of an estimated 35.3 million community-living older adults, 21.1 million (59.7%) were internet users, and of this group, more than one-third (35.8%) engaged in telehealth. In a multivariable regression model adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level factors, age, education, income, and the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription were associated with engagement in telehealth, while race, health, county metropolitan status, and neighborhood social deprivation were not. Among internet users, living in a neighborhood at the lowest (versus highest) tertile of broadband internet subscription was associated with being 40% less likely to engage in telehealth (adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.87), all else equal.

SETTING: Ophthalmology department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitrio do Porto (CHUP), Oporto, Portugal. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, non-randomized, retrospective study. METHODOLOGY: Data of all patients waiting for cataract surgery were analysed at the beginning of May 2020, after two months without performing elective surgery. The waiting time since surgical inscription was considered an independent and overriding factor. Also, higher priority was given to patients with white or brunescent cataracts and patients with low visual acuity: corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) &#8804;20/200 in binocular patients or CDVA &#8804;20/63 in monocular patients. Criteria of medium priority included patients that remained with anisometropia and patients with glaucoma or low to moderate risk of chronic angle closure. Data of scheduled surgeries in the following months were then analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients were waiting for phacoemulsification in our center. 191 patients (26.64%) had more than 4.5 months on the waiting list; the medium waiting time was 3.511.57 months. According to both priority criteria and waiting time, 48.6% (n=348) were categorized as priority cases. A total of 158 patients (22.0%) met the highest priority; 61 patients (8.5%) met the medium priority criteria. In 129 patients (18.0%), priority was considered based solely on higher waiting time. This algorithm allowed us to operate all priority cases within the first three months.

The current analysis aimed to investigate the predictors of healing among Italian COVID-19 patients. We also assessed the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome. METHODS We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. We analyzed information from 2446 charts of Italian patients admitted for certified COVID-19 in 27 hospitals. Healing from COVID-19 infection, defined as two consecutive negative swabs, was reported in 544 patients (22.2%), 95% of them were hospitalized. RESULTS Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly lower in healing compared with nonhealing patients (63  15 vs. 69  15 and 2  2 vs. 3  2, both P < 0.05). In multivariable regression model, predictors of healing were younger age (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P = 0.0001), absence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.70, P = 0.003) or heart failure (OR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70, P = 0.001). In the subgroup of patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart failure (n = 1498), no differences were observed in the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that younger age and absence of comorbidities play a major role in determining healing in patients with COVID-19.

Recent literature has implicated COVID-19 in the reported increase in new-onset DM cases, as well as mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS cases, however a rise in HHS cases alone has not been well reported [1,2]. We noted an anecdotal increase in the frequency of HHS cases in our pediatric tertiary care center following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate further, a retrospective chart review evaluating all patients with DM admitted in the first 6 months of 2019 and the first 6 months of 2020 was conducted. A diagnosis of HHS was defined as a blood glucose over 600 mg/dL with a serum osmolality (calculated or measured) greater than 320 mOsm/kg on initial laboratory evaluation. Patients with DKA, defined as a serum bicarbonate level less than 16 mmol/L with evidence of significant ketosis (serum ketones greater than 3 mmol/L), were excluded from the study. During the first 6 months of 2019, 1 patient met inclusion criteria. However, the diagnosis of HHS was complicated by a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, which may have contributed to the hyperosmolar state, and a nonketotic lactic acidosis. Five HHS cases were noted in the first 6 months of 2020, 4 of which occurred in May and June. For the 2020 HHS cohort, the average patient age  SD was 12  3.34 years. The mean  SD laboratory values included bicarbonate 18.2  1.64 mmol/L, serum blood glucose 776.8  30.75 mg/dL, calculated serum osmolality 328  4.18 mOsm/kg, and HgA1C 12.72  1.16%. All 5 patients in the 2020 cohort had new-onset DM, with 4 of the 5 patients having at least 1 positive DM antibody (GAD antibodies were positive in 3, ICA/IA-2 antibodies in 2, and Zinc Transporter 8 antibodies in 1). No patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, and only 1 patient was tested for COVID-19 by PCR, which returned negative. However, SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was not available, and it is unknown if these patients had prior COVID-19 illness. In conclusion, we noted an increased incidence of HHS at our hospital, particularly among new-onset, antibody positive DM patients during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further study and investigation are needed to determine the cause of this increased local incidence, and if infectious, social, or economic influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed.

METHODS: Clinical key, Uptodate, Ovid, Ebscohost, Pubmed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Dynamed, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Once the search was completed, dynamic sleep MRI data were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen articles reported on 410 OSA patients and 79 controls that underwent dynamic sleep MRI and were included in this review. For meta-analysis of dynamic sleep MRI data, eight articles presented relevant data on 160 OSA patients. Obstruction was reported as follows: retropalatal (RP) 98%, retroglossal (RG) 41% and hypopharyngeal (HP) in 5%. Lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW) collapse was found in 35/73 (48%) patients. The combinations of RP + RG were observed in 24% and RP + RG + LPW in 16%. If sedation was used, 98% of study participants fell asleep compared to 66% of unsedated participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic sleep MRI has demonstrated that nearly all patients have retropalatal obstruction, retroglossal obstruction is common and hypopharyngeal obstruction is rare.

This analysis allows, on one hand, providing control of morbidity and mortality of patients with socially significant pathologies and, on the other hand, monitoring the effectivity of treatments to identify and correct their shortcomings. Time-related changes in results of myocardial revascularization performed for ACS patients in the Russian Federation in 2020 were analyzed and compared with the values of 2016-2019 based on data of the Russian Ministry of Health Care monitoring.Material and methods Yearly absolute, relative, and calculated indices of revascularization for ACS were analyzed and compared based on data of the Russian Ministry of Health Care monitoring in 2016-2020.Results In the Russian Federation in 2020, the lowest number of hospitalizations for ACS (403,a931) was recorded with an unprecedented ratio of 1a/a1.8 for STEMI/nSTEACS, respectively. In Russia in 2020, the proportion of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (pPCI) for STEMI continued growing; it reached 44% and peaked to the maximum for 2016-2020. At the same time, the thrombolytic therapy (TLT) remained essential in the structure of reperfusion strategies during those years (24.0-27.3a% of all STEMI cases). Total death rate of admitted patients with STEMI in Russia was stable at the level of 13.1-14.6a%. In 2020, there were no significant differences in quality indexes of the treatment for STEMI from the previous period (2016-2019). A yearly relative increase in the number of PCIs for STEACS (from 16a% in 2016 to 30a% in 2020 and from 30% to 46% for high-risk nSTEACS) was observed. In 2020, a significant increase in death rate was observed for nSTEACS as a whole (to 4.1a%) and for individual subgroups (high-risk nSTEACS, to 4.5a%; after PCI for nSTEACS, to 1.8a%; and after PCI for high-risk nSTEACS, to 2.8a%) whereas mean death rate values in these subgroups in 2016-2019 were 2.75a%, 3.45a%, 1.5a%, and 2.3a%, respectively.Conclusion The analysis of revascularization indexes in ACS patients based on the Ministry of Health Care of Russia monitoring performed in 2016-2020 showed a number of positive trends, including an increase in the total number of revascularization procedures; a decrease in the time from the disease onset to the endovascular treatment; an increase in the availability of stenting for severe ACS; and general stabilization of the mortality. On the other hand, the Russian Federation is considerably behind European countries in several qualitative and quantitative parameters of health care in ACS, such as pPCI availability, symptom-to-balloon time, total mortality of all hospitalized STEMI patients, and revascularization for nSTEACS. Despite the gradual improvement of relative quantitative indexes of myocardial revascularization for ACS, negative changes in the absolute number of myocardial revascularizations for various forms of ACS and a notable increase in the death rate in nSTEACS were observed in 2020, including patients after PCI.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was to determine the number of grants and funding amount the NIH allocated for COVID-19 by research type and clinical/scientific area. The secondary outcome was to calculate the time from the funding opportunity announcement to the award notice date. ResultsThe NIH awarded a total of 56,169 grants in 2020, of which 2.0% (n=1,108) were allocated for COVID-19 research. The NIH had a $42 billion budget that year, of which 5.3% ($2.2 billion) was allocated to COVID-19 research. The most common clinical/scientific areas were social determinants of health (n=278, 8.5% of COVID-19 funding), immunology (n=211, 25.8%), and pharmaceutical interventions research (n=208, 47.6%). There were 104 grants studying COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions, of which 2 grants studied the efficacy of face masks and 6 studied the efficacy of social distancing.

AIM: To assess the feasibility of using an auricular point acupressure (APA) mobile app as a self-guided tool to learn and self-administer APA to manage chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to compare cLBP outcomes between 2 groups (app vs app + telehealth). DESIGN: A 2-phase study design was used. In phase 1, participants (app group, n = 18) had in-person study visits and installed the app to learn and self-administer APA to manage cLBP. In phase 2, all research activities occurred remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so a second group was recruited (app + telehealth, n = 19). The app + telehealth group underwent a virtual session, installed the app, and were provided the opportunity for questions and verification on the accuracy of the self-administered APA. SETTING: The participants were recruited by distributing study flyers at outpatient clinics and referrals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants with chronic low back pain were eliglbe for the study. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design with a mixed methods approach, all participants were instructed to download the APA app, provided an APA kit (includes seeds embedded within pre-cut squares of adhesive tape), and advised to self-administer APA with guidance from the app for 4 weeks to manage their cLBP. Study outcomes were collected at the preintervention time point as well as postintervention and 1-month follow-up. Interviews were also conducted at the postintervention time point. RESULTS: Of the 37 participants enrolled, six dropped out, and the attrition rate was 16%. Adherence to APA practice was high (85%-94%). After 4 weeks of APA treatment, participants in the app + telehealth group experienced a 29% decrease in pain intensity during the postintervention time point and a 35% reduction during the 1-month follow-up. Similar improvements were noted in pain interference (28%) and physical function (39%) for participants in the app + telehealth group at the 1-month follow-up. These changes are slightly higher compared with those in the app group (21% pain intensity reduction, 23% improved pain interferences, and 26% improved physical function) during the 1-month follow-up. Overall, APA was found to be feasible using the app and the qualitative findings showed acceptability of the intervention in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to learn and self-administer APA with an app, supplemented with either in-person or telehealth sessions, presenting a promising intervention toward cLBP self-management.

METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for Vaborem compared to BAT in CRE-KPC patients over a 5 year time horizon. The model structure for Vaborem simulated the clinical pathway of patients with a confirmed CRE-KPC infection. Model inputs for clinical effectiveness were sourced from the TANGO II trial, and published literature. Costs, resource use and utility values associated with CRE-KPC infections in the UK were sourced from the British National Formulary, NHS reference costs and published sources. RESULTS: Over a 5 year time horizon, Vaborem use increased total costs by 5165 and increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.366, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 14,113 per QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of discharge to long-term care (LTC), the annual cost of LTC and the utility of discharge to home. At thresholds of 20,000/QALY and 30,000/QALY, the probability of Vaborem being cost-effective compared to BAT was 79.85% and 94.93%, respectively.

This study utilises long period grating (LPG) optical fibre sensors, incorporated into the lumen of endotracheal tubes (ETTs), to monitor in real time, Pseudomonas aeruginosa surface colonisation and biofilm formation. The wavelength shift of LPG attenuation bands was monitored for 24 h and compared with biofilm biomass, quantified using confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging. Biofilm formation was compared on uncoated ETTs and optical fibres, and on a biofilm resistant acrylate polymer, after challenge in an artificial sputum or minimal growth medium (RPMI-1640). The LPG sensor was able to detect a biofilm biomass as low as 81 g cm-2, by comparison with the confocal image quantification. An empirical exponential function was found to link the optical attenuation wavelength shift with the inverse of the biofilm biomass, allowing quantification of biofouling from the spectral response. Quantification from the sensor allows infection interception and early device removal, to reduce, for example, the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia.","output":"Real time monitoring of biofilm formation on coated medical devices for the reduction and interception of bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims at applying optimal control to investigate different vaccination strategies against the epidemic spread of viral diseases.

The current study aimed to investigate (1) whether social distancing measures, particularly limiting close social interactions, are associated with loneliness among older adults, and (2) whether the association between social distancing measures and loneliness is moderated by sociodemographic characteristics. Data were from the fourth wave (April 29 to May 26, 2020) of the nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS) COVID-19 Survey. We used data on adults 50 years or older (N = 3,283). Multivariate logistic regression models of loneliness were examined to test the independent effects of social distancing measures and their interaction with sociodemographic characteristics on loneliness. Four indicators of social distancing measures were considered: (a) avoiding public spaces, gatherings, or crowds, (b) canceling or postponing social activities, (c) social visits, (d) close contact (within 6 feet) with others. Cancelling or postponing social activities and avoiding close contact with other people were associated with 36% and 41% greater odds of loneliness, respectively. Furthermore, males and non-Hispanic Whites who had no close contact with others had a significantly greater probability of reporting loneliness than those who had contact.

Tissue damage has been documented both clinically and histologically in multiple systems including the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal distress may be correlated with histopathologic findings. Studies have shown direct infection of epithelial cells in the GI tract in patients with the disease. The objective of this study is to identify specific histologic alterations that are present in patients with COVID-19. METHODS/CASE REPORT: At our institution, a retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate all COVID-positive patients who underwent any gastrointestinal procedure within 30 days after their positive test. The time frame included January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Chart reviews were performed to document radiographic studies, endoscopic findings, histopathologic analysis, and clinical symptoms. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): A total of 26 patients met our criteria for inclusion in the study. The cohort consisted of 10 males and 16 females ranging in age from 13 to 78 years. Tissue was sent for histologic analysis in 19 of these individuals. Tubular adenomas (13), chronic gastritis (11), and prominent intestinal lymphoid aggregates (7) were the most common pathologic findings (Table 1). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the histopathologic findings rendered from GI procedures of patients with COVID-19 may be non-specific and may not reveal any morphologic correlate to the clinical signs and symptoms.

In the present study, we aimed to assess whether human cardiac cells could release immune mediators upon stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs). Commercially available human cardiac fibroblasts and an immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line were stimulated in vitro with TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 agonists. In addition, cytosolic RLRs were activated in cardiac cells after transfection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC). Upon stimulation of TLR3, TLR4, MDA5, and RIG-I, but not upon stimulation of TLR2, human cardiac fibroblasts produced high amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. On the contrary, the immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line was unresponsive to the tested TLRs agonists. Upon RLRs stimulation, cardiac fibroblasts, and to a lesser extent the cardiomyocyte cell line, induced anti-viral IFN- expression. These data demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblasts and an immortalized human cardiomyocyte cell line differently respond to various TLRs and RLRs ligands. In particular, human cardiac fibroblasts were able to induce pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines on their own. These aspects will contribute to better understand the immunological function of the different cell populations that make up the cardiac tissue.","output":"Human cardiac fibroblasts produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon TLRs and RLRs stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy, a highly regulated degradative process that promotes cellular homeostasis, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental component of the cellular response against viral infection. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy during Junn virus (JUNV) multiplication using human A549 cells.

JUNV infection also induced the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62, suggesting that complete autophagic flux was triggered. In addition, we showed that inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine significantly reduces viral multiplication. Moreover, viral yield was increased when autophagy was induced using rapamycin. Furthermore, JUNV infection induced the colocalisation of p62, ATG16, RAB5, RAB7A and LAMP1 with the autophagosomal LC3 protein. That suggests that phagosomes undergo the maturation process during viral infection. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA experiments targeting essential autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin 1) reduce viral protein synthesis and viral yield.

However, several aspects of this effect remain poorly understood, for example regarding the role of prior religiosity and stress-induced anxiety. This paper explores these aspects in the context of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The latter has impacted dramatically on many people's well-being; hence it can be considered a highly stressful event. Through online questionnaires administered to UK (n = 140) and USA (n = 140) citizens professing either Christian faith or no religion, this paper examines the impact of the coronavirus crisis upon common people's religious beliefs. Anxiety about the coronavirus and prior religiosity showed an interaction effect upon change in religious beliefs (t(276) = 2.27, p = .024): for strong believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased strengthening of religious beliefs (r = .249), while for non-believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased scepticism towards religious beliefs (r = - .157). These observations are consistent with the notion that stress-induced anxiety enhances support for an individual's existing ideology already embraced before a stressful event occurs.

The search strategy used keywords, \\"etomidate,\\" \\"adrenal insufficiency,\\" \\"glucocorticoid,\\" and \\"intensive care.\\" Both authors reviewed electronic data search titles, abstracts and extracted data, which were checked by the other reviewer. Primary outcome was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome was adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS There were 29 trials of etomidate versus comparators in 8584 patients. Etomidate was associated with adrenal insufficiency (risk ratio (rr) = 154, 95% CI; 142, 167, p < 0.001) and increased overall relative mortality rates (rr = 1.09, CI;1.04,1.16, p = 0.001). Meta-regression showed that with etomidate there was a continuous progressive relative risk of mortality associated with increasing severity of illness (predefined in each article by standard critical illness scores). In those patients who had a predicted mortality rate > the median for this analysis (predicted mortality 44%) the relative mortality rate (rr) = 1.20, Ci;1.12,1.29, p < 0.001, the absolute risk difference (rd) = 0.08, CI;0.05,0.11, p < 0.0001 and the number needed to harm (1/rd) was 12.5.

EMA is an ideal tool to measure weight-related behaviors, such as parental feeding practices, stress, and dietary intake, as these occur on a daily basis and vary across time and context. A recent systematic review recommended standardized reporting of EMA design for studies that address weight-related behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To answer the call for reporting study designs using EMA, this paper describes in detail the EMA design of the Family Matters study and how it was adapted over time to improve functionality and meet the needs of a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse sample. METHODS: Family Matters is an incremental, 2-phased, mixed methods study, conducted with a racially and ethnically diverse, immigrant and refugee sample from largely low-income households, designed to examine risk and protective factors for child weight and weight-related behaviors in the home environment. The Family Matters study intentionally recruited White, Black, Hmong, Latino, Native American, and Somali parents with young children. Parents in phase 1 of the study completed 8 days of EMA on their smartphones, which included signal-contingent surveys (eg, asking about the parents stress at the time of the survey), event-contingent surveys (eg, descriptions of the meal the child ate), and end-of-day surveys (eg, overall assessment of the childs day). RESULTS: A detailed description of EMA strategies, protocols, and methods used in phase 1 of the Family Matters study is provided. Compliance with EMA surveys and participants time spent completing EMA surveys are presented and stratified by race and ethnicity. In addition, lessons learned while conducting phase 1 EMA are shared to document how EMA methods were improved and expanded upon for phase 2 of the Family Matters study. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study provided an important next step in identifying best practices for EMA use in assessing weight-related behaviors in the home environment.

On the 11th of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and nations around the world have taken drastic measures to reduce transmission of the disease. The situation is similar in Switzerland, a small high-income country in Central Europe, where the first COVID-19 case was registered on the 25th of February 2020. Through literature review as well as correspondence with public health professionals and experts in mathematical modeling, this case study focuses on the outbreaks impact on Switzerland and on the measures this country has implemented thus far. Along with the rapid spread of the virus, the political organization, economy, healthcare system, and characteristics of the country greatly influence the approach taken in facing the crisis. Switzerland appears to be structurally well-prepared, but, according to mathematical modeling predictions, in order to avoid total collapse of healthcare facilities, the measures taken by the Swiss Government need to reduce the virus transmission chain by at least 70%. Fortunately, updated models on April 22nd show evidence that the non-pharmaceutical measures invoked have decreased transmission by an estimated 89%, proving effective management by the federal government and allowing for progressive deconfinement measures.","output":"Understanding the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Real-Time Analysis of Switzerlands First Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While the efficacy and guidelines for implementation of rapid response systems are well established, limited information exists about rapid response paradigms for paediatric cardiac patients despite their unique pathophysiology. METHODS: With endorsement from the Paediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, we designed and implemented a web-based survey of paediatric cardiac and multidisciplinary ICU medical directors in the United States of America and Canada to better understand paediatric cardiac rapid response practices. RESULTS: Sixty-five (52%) of 125 centres responded. Seventy-one per cent of centres had a300 non-ICU beds and 71% had dedicated cardiac ICUs. To respond to cardiac patients, dedicated cardiac rapid response teams were utilised in 29% of all centres (39% and 5% in centres with and without dedicated cardiac ICUs, respectively) [p = 0.006]. Early warning scores were utilised in 62% of centres. Only 31% reported that rapid response teams received specialised training. Transfers to ICU were higher for cardiac (73%) compared to generalised rapid response events (54%). The monitoring and reassessment of patients not transferred to ICU after the rapid response was variable. Cardiac and respiratory arrests outside the ICU were infrequent. Only 29% of centres formally appraise critical deterioration events (need for ventilation and/or inotropes post-rapid response) and 34% perform post-event debriefs. CONCLUSION: Paediatric cardiac rapid response practices are variable and dedicated paediatric cardiac rapid response systems are infrequent in the United States of America and Canada.

However, hydroxychloroquine may prolong the QTc interval, thus increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. Many patients with COVID-19 have comorbidities, necessitating the use of several drugs simultaneously with hydroxychloroquine. However, the risk of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between hydroxychloroquine and these co-medications has not been identified. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the risk of QT interval prolongation due to DDIs between hydroxychloroquine and frequently used concurrent drugs. Methods and Results: Using 447,632 patients and 1,040,752 electrocardiograms, we investigated the risk of QT prolongation due to DDIs between hydroxychloroquine and 118 concurrent drugs frequently used in real-world practice. In the analysis, we observed that 11 drugs (trimebutine, tacrolimus, tramadol, rosuvastatin, ciclosporin, sulfasalazine, rofecoxib, diltiazem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and isoniazid) show DDIs with hydroxychloroquine in the direction of QT prolongation. Conclusions: : We found 11 drugs that show significant ( p <0.05) DDIs with hydroxychloroquine, thereby increasing the risk of QT prolongation in patients. It is necessary to consider prescribing alternative drugs that have less DDI when these drugs are concurrently administered with hydroxychloroquine. Further investigation is needed to assess more profoundly the risk of QT prolongation due to DDI with hydroxychloroquine of each drug that we found in this analysis.","output":"Risk of QT Prolongation through Drug-drug Interactions between Hydroxychloroquine and Concomitant Drugs Prescribed in Real-world Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Formal education in global health (GH) and short-term experiences in GH (STEGH) are offered by many emergency medicine (EM) residency programs in the United States.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies utilising tocilizumab in COVID-19 on different databases (PubMed/MEDLINE/Scopus) and preprint servers (medRxiv and SSRN) from inception until 20 July 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42020195690). Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed. The impact of tocilizumab and concomitant corticosteroid therapy or tocilizumab alone versus standard of care (SOC) on the death rate, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and bacterial infections were assessed. Results. Thirty-nine studies with 15,531 patients (3657 cases versus 11,874 controls) were identified. Unadjusted estimates (n = 28) failed to demonstrate a protective effect of tocilizumab on survival (OR 0.74 ([95%CI 0.55C1.01], p = 0.057), mechanical ventilation prevention (OR 2.21 [95%CI 0.53C9.23], p = 0.277) or prevention of ICU admission (OR 3.79 [95%CI 0.38C37.34], p = 0.254).

The present study seeks to elucidate the composition of the microbiota associated with the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii and the functional strategies of the main symbionts. We combined microscopic approaches with metagenome-guided microbial genome reconstruction and amplicon community profiling toward this goal. Microscopic imaging revealed that the host and microbial cells appeared within dense biomass patches that are presumably syncytial tissue aggregates. Based on abundances in amplicon libraries and metagenomic data, SAR324 bacteria, Crenarchaeota, Patescibacteria, and Nanoarchaeota were identified as abundant members of the V. pourtalesii microbiome; thus, their genomic potentials were analyzed in detail. A general pattern emerged in that the V. pourtalesii symbionts had very small genome sizes, in the range of 0.5 to 2.2 Mb, and low GC contents, even below those of seawater relatives. Based on functional analyses of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we propose two major microbial strategies: the \\"givers,\\" namely, Crenarchaeota and SAR324, heterotrophs and facultative anaerobes, produce and partly secrete all required amino acids and vitamins. The \\"takers,\\" Nanoarchaeota and Patescibacteria, are anaerobes with reduced genomes that tap into the microbial community for resources, e.g., lipids and DNA, likely using pilus-like structures.

The microbial community was found to be concentrated within biomass patches and is dominated by small cells (<1 m). MAG analyses showed consistently small genome sizes and low GC contents, which is unusual compared to known sponge symbionts.

However, TLRs do not contain the conserved dual immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs that typically recruit Syk to many other receptors. One possibility is that the Syk-TLR association is indirect, relying on an intermediary scaffolding protein. We previously identified a role for the palmitoylated transmembrane adapter protein SCIMP in scaffolding the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn, for TLR phosphorylation, but the role of SCIMP in mediating the interaction between Syk and TLRs has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that SCIMP recruits Syk in response to lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4 activation. We also show that Syk contributes to the phosphorylation of SCIMP and TLR4 to enhance their binding. Further evidence pinpoints two specific phosphorylation sites in SCIMP critical for its interaction with Syk-SH2 domains in the absence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Finally, using inhibitors and primary macrophages from SCIMP(-/-) mice, we confirm a functional role for SCIMP-mediated Syk interaction in modulating TLR4 phosphorylation, signaling, and cytokine outputs. In conclusion, we identify SCIMP as a novel, immune-specific Syk scaffold, which can contribute to inflammation through selective TLR-driven inflammatory responses.","output":"The transmembrane adapter SCIMP recruits tyrosine kinase Syk to phosphorylate Toll-like receptors to mediate selective inflammatory outputs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In these days, the role that fine particles in urban areas could play in facilitating the pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus is becoming increasingly important It is also well known that exposure to air pollution and in particular to fine dust favors diseases involving the respiratory system In this context of strong concern, we argue that urban forests can contribute to reduce the concentrations of particulates or in any increase their dispersion Not all tree species have the same performance in removing particulates In this short article, recent works are commented that classify urban forest species according to their ability to reduce particulate matter ambient concentrations, and we conclude highlighting the significant role that urban forests could play in improving air quality and human wellbeing in the future","output":"Urban forests at the time of COVID-19 protect us from fine dust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeHospitality and tourism researchers are yet to provide evidence of actual crisis management amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially from a resource-scarce destination perspective. By adapting a crisis management framework, the authors elected to fill this gap by exploring small and medium-sized hospitality and tourism operators' (SMHTOs) personal experiences of managing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Ghana. The study uncovers their crisis-coping strategies as well as immediate- and long-term post-recovery strategies.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative lens, informed by phenomenology as well as theoretical saturation, data were collected from 20 owner-managers (OMs) and non-owner managers (NOMs) of accommodation, restaurants, travel and tour (T&T) agencies and souvenir shop operators via a combination of telephone and socially distanced face-to-face interviews as well as participant observation. Data were thematically analysed involving both deductive and inductive coding techniques. Data validity and reliability were confirmed using member check and inter-rater/coder reliability statistic in SPSS, respectively.FindingsImpacts of the pandemic on businesses included shutdowns, booking cancellations, revenue drops, lay-offs and defaults in the payment of pension contributions and taxes. The pandemic greatly impacted the accommodation, T&T and souvenir shop operators compared to food and beverage (F&B) operators due to the temporary closure of Ghana's borders and major attractions. The study identified six phases in SMHTOs crisis management process: awareness, combating the spread of COVID-19, coping mechanisms, short-term/immediate and long-term recovery measures and lessons learned. Besides, state institutions and personal beliefs influenced the coping and recovery actions used by SMHTOs.Practical implicationsIt is critical for governments and industry management institutions to consider the capabilities and specific actions taken by SMHTOs during a crisis such as COVID-19 in the efforts to support their crisis preparedness and response strategies. Furthermore, SME operators in the industry must see insurance uptake as one important measure that could help them cope with the losses instigated by the impact of a crisis and possibly speed up their recovery.Originality/valueThe study extends the general crisis management framework by including additional phases of crisis management and the specific activities carried out by SMHTOs in managing the COVID-19 crisis. This makes this study one of the first studies in Africa that examined crisis-coping and post-recovery strategies amongst small and medium-sized hospitality and tourism firms.","output":"Managing the COVID-19 crisis: coping and post-recovery strategies for hospitality and tourism businesses in Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children and causes significant disease in the elderly and immunocompromised. Recently there has been an acceleration in the development of candidate RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutics. However, the effects of RSV genomic variability on the implementation of vaccines and therapeutics remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Fogarty International Center held a workshop to summarize what is known about the global burden and transmission of RSV disease, the phylogeographic dynamics and genomics of the virus, and the networks that exist to improve the understanding of RSV disease. Discussion at the workshop focused on the implications of viral evolution and genomic variability for vaccine and therapeutics development in the context of various immunization strategies. This paper summarizes the meeting, highlights research gaps and future priorities, and outlines what has been achieved since the meeting took place.

Understanding the balance of cellular factors that inhibit or promote arenavirus infection may have important implications for the development of effective antiviral strategies. Here, we identified the cell-intrinsic zinc transmembrane metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, as a restriction factor against arenaviruses. Notably, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ZMPSTE24 in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells increased arenavirus glycoprotein-mediated viral entry in pseudoparticle assays and live virus infection models. As a barrier to viral entry and replication, ZMPSTE24 may act as a downstream effector of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) antiviral function; though through a yet poorly understood mechanism. Overexpression of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins did not restrict the entry of pseudoparticles carrying arenavirus envelope glycoproteins and live virus infection. Furthermore, gain-of-function studies revealed that IFITMs augment the antiviral activity of ZMPSTE24 against arenaviruses, suggesting a cooperative effect of viral restriction. We show that ZMPSTE24 and IFITMs affect the kinetics of cellular endocytosis, suggesting that perturbation of membrane structure and stability is likely the mechanism of ZMPSTE24-mediated restriction and cooperative ZMPSTE24-IFITM antiviral activity. Collectively, our findings define the role of ZMPSTE24 host restriction activity in the early stages of arenavirus infection. Moreover, we provide insight into the importance of cellular membrane integrity for productive fusion of arenaviruses and highlight a novel avenue for therapeutic development.","output":"Inhibition of Arenavirus Entry and Replication by the Cell-Intrinsic Restriction Factor ZMPSTE24 Is Enhanced by IFITM Antiviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, due to its rapid and persistent global spread. In order to combat the pandemic, the WHO has recommended barrier measures that have affected the lives of people in many countries. Objectives: The present study aims to determine the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices related to barrier measures related to Covid-19 among secondary school students in the south of Benin during Physical and Sports Education (PSE) classes. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study carried out among 1000 students, including 387 girls from secondary schools in the Littoral department in southern Benin, using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The majority of the students surveyed showed average levels of knowledge (70%) and attitudes (66.6%) but a poor level of practice (0.0%) with regard to barrier measures at PSE or not. Conclusion: Awareness of the pandemic must therefore be reinforced among students in order to improve their knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to compliance with the recommended barrier measures. This will help prevent PSE classes from spreading COVID-19 in Beninese schools.

Methods We conducted an uncontrolled interrupted time series analysis of EMS calls (January 1, 2019 - March 1, 2021) in Marin County, California analyzing call volume (All calls, n=46,055); patient refusal of EMS care or transport and patient care resolved on scene (Calls with opportunity for transport; n=37,401); and call severity (Transported calls; n=27,887). Results Pre-COVID-19 (1/1/2019-3/2/2020), EMS transported patients were predominately female (50.6%), 80+ years old (31.6%), and Marin County residents (68.0%). During COVID-19 (3/3/2020-3/1/2021), EMS transported patients were predominately male (52.7%), 35-64 years old (29.8%), and Marin County residents (70.4%). After the first stay-at-home order on 3/17/2020, call volume immediately decreased by 48% (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=0.52; 95% CI=0.35,0.79) for children (0-15 years) and 34% for adults 80+ years (aIRR=0.66;95% CI=0.46,0.95). The odds of a transported call being prioritized as severe doubled (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.26; 95% CI=1.11,4.59). Though transport refusals increased by 69% for children after the first order (aOR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.13-2.52]), immediately following the second order on 12/8/2020, transport refusals decreased by 30% for children but increased 38-40% for adults 35-79 years (aOR=1.40 [95% CI=1.04-1.89] for 35-64 years; 1.38 [95% CI=1.02-1.87] for 65-79 years).

We describe our experience in such patients who were admitted to our tertiary care hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Our hospital is a tertiary care center accredited by Joint Commission International and Nurses Magnet Programs and runs active organ transplantation services. The patient population and treating ICU physicians are all Muslim. We collected twelve-month data from the year 2020 of patients who died in our ICU. Coronavirus Disease 2019 infected patients were treated separately and were not included in the study to give true reflection of the end-of-life care in Muslim patients under ordinary circumstances. Patient demographics, characteristics before and at ICU admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and DNAR details in ICU, and therapies administered in last 24 hours before death were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to organize the collected data. Continuous variables were described as median with Interquartile Range Q1-Q3 (IQR), and categorical variables were described as number and percentages, as appropriate. RESULTS: 104 Muslim patients died during the study period. Their median age was 64 years and 51% were male. These patients had a median of 5 underlying comorbidities and a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 6 at baseline, highlighting their moribund status. 56% had underlying illness that would have qualified them for hospice before admission. Patients spent a median of 10 days (IQR 6-15) in the ward before ICU admission, had a high APACHE II score of 23 (IQR 20-33) and lactic acid of 3.7 (IQR 2.2-4.8) upon ICU admission. Their duration of mechanical ventilation (6 days;IQR 4-9), ICU stay (6 days;IQR 2-13) and hospital length of stay (10 days;IQR 6-15) were relatively long. 92% were \\"Full Code\\" at ICU admission and the status was changed to 'do-not-attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) in about 67% of the cohort before death. 42 patients had CPR done and 8 were made DNAR after one CPR. DNAR decision was made after median of 13 days (IQR 7-22 days) of hospital admission and 5 days (IQR 2.5-9 days) before death. DNAR discussions were led by Intensivists in 89% of the cases. Until the very end, patients in both groups were on tube feeds, underwent blood draws, had few limitations on therapy or withdrawal of care. There was hardly any involvement of Muslim chaplain and palliative care service. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of DNAR is accepted in Muslim patients even though decision is made near end of life. Many patients with terminal disease ended up in the ICU and role of hospice and palliative care needs to be increased in this population. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: DNAR is acceptable in Muslim patients, however, active mechanisms need to be developed to avoid terminal patients suffering undue ICU course at end of life.

The current FMD vaccine provides no protection until 7 days after the vaccination, which reduces its effectiveness in the case of an outbreak. Therefore, to find an alternative method of applying antiviral agents for rapid and enhanced inhibition of the FMD virus (FMDV), we compared the antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents and attempted to apply them in combination. First, we measured and compared the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) to the mean inhibition effects of FMDV, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) to the mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents such as ribavirin, guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), 6-azauridine, and recombinant adenovirus expressing three small interference RNAs (Ad-siRNA) or porcine interferon- (Ad-porcine IFN-) in swine kidney cells (IBRS-2). The selectivity indices of ribavirin (35.2) and 6-azauridine (34.6) were higher than that of guanidine-HCl (26.9). The selectivity indices of Ad-siRNA or Ad-porcine IFN- were 7  10(3) or 7  10(4) based on the adenoviral titer. Next, we tested the combined effects of the FMDV inhibition agents. Enhanced inhibition effects were observed in the IBRS-2 cells and in suckling mice from the combination of Ad-porcine IFN- and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin. The combined application of these recombinant adenoviruses and ribavirin may enhance their inhibitory effect on FMDV and overcome FMDV resistance against antiviral agents.","output":"Enhanced inhibition of foot-and-mouth disease virus by combinations of porcine interferon- and antiviral agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most efficient countermeasure against infectious agents and their caused diseases is the development and wide use of safe and effective vaccines.

Our assay is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single tube within 40 min, requiring only a single temperature control (62 C). The RT-LAMP reagents were added to the sample vial, while CRISPR Cas12a reagents were deposited onto the lid of the vial.

Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease.

The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes.

We compared moribund and surviving (14%) whiteleg shrimp Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei from an experimental challenge with YHV-1. Although grossly normal, all survivors were positive for YHV-1 by specific, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, histological analysis or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating that they were not resistant but tolerant to YHV-1. On the other hand, real-time PCR analysis revealed that mean YHV-1 copies/ng total RNA for survivors (2.81046.9104) were approximately 40 times lower (P<0.05) than those in moribund shrimp (1.21066.7105 copies/ng total RNA).

No signs of meningism were found. A throat swab for viral pathogens (taken prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) returned negative, and blood culture showed no growth. Within a few days she returned to the Accident & Emergency Department with worsening of the rash but was again discharged. The following week she was admitted with abdominal pain and a prominent purpuric rash on her legs. Results Full blood count, Rheumatoid Factor, Anti-Nuclear Antibodies, ANCA and Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibodies, serum Tryptase & C1 esterase inhibitor were all within normal limits. Urine culture grew E.coli. Complement C3 was raised at 2.24 g/L (0.75-1.65) and C4 was within normal range. Her blood pressure was raised at 173/104 mmHg. Antistreptolysin O serology was also normal. Urine analysis revealed haematuria and mild proteinuria. Urine Protein:Creatinine ratio of 22mg/mmol (normal <50). Her purpuric rash had progressed, and she had further abdominal pain. She had taken co-codamol which led to nausea & constipation. She had avoided NSAIDs. Her CRP by this stage was 131mg/L. Clinically the rash on the legs, abdominal pain and haematuria was consistent with HSP. She was started on Prednisolone 10mg od, tapering in 2.5mg per week decrements. The patient was discharged home but returned the following weekend with cramping abdominal pain radiating to the back. Abdominal Xray showed dilated colon at the splenic flexure. After review by the Surgical on call team, a CT Abdomen & Pelvis showed a right adrenal haemorrhage, and inflammatory change in both adrenals. Although she did not display clinical signs of Addisonian crisis or sepsis, she was transferred to HDU for monitoring. Her blood pressure was 151/86 mmHg and her serum urea & electrolytes were normal. The Prednisolone dose was changed to Hydrocortisone, and the dose increased to cover stress of acute illness. MRI of the adrenal glands confirmed right adrenal haemorrhage but showed no evidence of aneurysms or tumours. Antiphospholipid & Cryoglobulins screens were negative. Further blood cultures, pneumococcal and legionella antigens returned negative. Viral Hepatitis screen (A, B & E) was negative. Synacthen test revealed a suboptimal response (Cortisol t0=181nmol/L, t30=260nmol/L, normal response >420nmol/L). Adrenal Autoantibodies returned negative. She was discharged home on oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone and remained well at Rheumatology and Endocrine follow up.

The transition from face-to-face to distance learning was not smooth in Ukraine because distance learning was not a common practice in the country before and teachers were unprepared for teaching online. This unusual situation prompted us to start our qualitative research primarily to get insights into the altered daily routines of teachers and educators. In particular, we were interested in how they assessed their students performance online. This article focuses on secondary school language teachers (n=65) and language tutors at the tertiary level (n=18). The research findings have revealed that teachers gave feedback through different digital applications like Google Classroom. Oral performance was evaluated either synchronously or asynchronously. The most crucial implication is that teachers should improve and further develop their digital skills and distance teaching and assessing skills in order to provide quality education in the modern form.","output":"Assessing Language Learners Knowledge and Performance during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En este artculo se muestran las publicaciones que consideramos ms relevantes sobre cardiopatas congnitas (CC) en el ltimo a?o.

Cilia are involved in a variety of cellular functions and perceptions, with one of them being the sense of smell. Hyposmia is a typical feature found in patients with BBS. However, reports of olfactory dysfunction in other cystic kidney diseases are sparse. Here we provide a systematic survey on olfaction in a large cohort of patients displaying genetically determined renal ciliopathies. METHODS We performed a match-controlled systematic olfactory evaluation in a group of 75 patients with a defined genetic background using age adapted and validated odour identification tests. RESULTS Test results revealed a significant olfactory deficit in patients carrying TMEM67 variants (n=4), while all other genetic disorders causing nephronophthisis (n=25) or polycystic kidney disease (n=18) were not associated with an impaired sense of smell. Also in patients with BBS, olfactory performance was depending on the underlying molecular defect. While defects in the BBS1 gene (n=9) had no impact on the sense of smell, all other BBS gene disorders (n=19) were associated with significant hyposmia. Noteworthy, there was no correlation of the olfactory deficit with the level of renal impairment. CONCLUSION Hyposmia is a part of the clinical spectrum of BBS and of other renal ciliopathies. Depending on the genetic background, clinicians should be aware of this subtle and so far underappreciated symptom when clinically assessing patients with BBS or TMEM67 gene variants.","output":"Systematic evaluation of olfaction in patients with hereditary cystic kidney diseases/renal ciliopathies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused staggering human and economic costs.

This year (2020), Ramadan is very different from previous years due to the outbreak of a terrible microscopic giant called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pandemic COVID-19 has made Ramadan very important this year because the virus has infected millions of people around the world and killed thousands, especially people with immunodeficiency. In dealing with COVID-19, maintaining good hygiene and supporting the immune system are effective, preventive approaches. Moderate exercise training and proper nutrition are the most important factors to support immune function. Lack of facilities, poor health and many traditions that lead to public community gatherings have made many Islamic countries susceptible to this dangerous virus. In such an unprecedented situation, there are many Muslims who doubt whether they can fast or not. Therefore, the proposal of usable exercise programs and effective nutritional strategies is imperative. In this study, we will look at the proposed health effects of fasting and its impact on the immune system, the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting on resting values and responses of immunological/antioxidant biomarkers in elite and recreational athletes, together with the important health, nutrition, and exercise advice that fasting people need to follow in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Ramadan Fasting During the COVID-19 Pandemic; Observance of Health, Nutrition and Exercise Criteria for Improving the Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Saudi Arabia, like any other part of the earthly globe, has been exposed to the Covid-19 pandemic The first case appeared on March 3, 2020, followed by an increase in the number of infections until it reached thousands with the numbers on the rise Therefore, adopting clear strategies to deal with the pandemic according to specific data on its size is necessary In this study, the time series of the number of infections and deaths were analyzed to study the behavior of the pandemic over time The cumulative curve of the phenomenon was analyzed to show the extent of the pandemic's decline or spread On the other hand, the time curve of the number of cases of the pandemic was fitted based on a set of mathematical and statistical models, which were divided into three sections [nonlinear growth model, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model, regression model] to attain the best possible fitting of the relationship curve The results show that the Weibull model and Polynomial model at (n = 4) are the best models for fitting the relationship at short run and the SEIR model gives better relationship fitting at long run In conclusion, there is a tendency for the disease to decline during the short period, while expecting other waves of the epidemic that will recede in the long term with the emergence of a suitable vaccine [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of IIUM Medical Journal Malaysia is the property of International Islamic University Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Using Mathematical and Statistical Model to Forecast the Path of Infection by Covid-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrasound, chest X-ray, and computed tomography (CT) have been used with excellent results in diagnosis, first assessment, and follow-up of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients.

The spike (S) glycoprotein of CoV is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus neutralization by antibodies. Hence, knowledge of neutralization determinants on the S protein is helpful for designing protective vaccines. To analyze the antigenic structure of the SARS-CoV S2 domain, the carboxyl-terminal half of the S protein, we first used sera from convalescent SARS patients to test the antigenicity of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire S2 and identified two antigenic determinants (Leu 803 to Ala 828 and Pro 1061 to Ser 1093). To determine whether neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by these two determinants, we immunized animals and found that both of them could induce the S2-specific antisera. In some animals, however, only one determinant (Leu 803 to Ala 828) was able to induce the antisera with the binding ability to the native S protein and the neutralizing activity to the SARS-CoV pseudovirus. This determinant is highly conserved across different SARS-CoV isolates. Identification of a conserved antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein, which has the potential for inducing neutralizing antibodies, has implications in the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV.","output":"Identification of an antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many ways the historical complexity of Macaus linguistic ecology is under threat.

We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings - a relevant tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection - obtained from three cohorts of uninfected individuals, and investigated how non-genetic and genetic factors affect the regulation of host genes implicated in COVID-19. We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections.

We found that although the T lymphocytes were decreased in the blood of patients with virus infection, the remaining T cells still highly expressed inflammatory genes and persisted for a while after recovery in patients. We also observed the potential transition from effector CD8 T cells to central memory T cells in recovered patients at the late stage. Among B lymphocytes, we analyzed the expansion trajectory of a subtype of plasma cells in severe COVID-19 patients and traced the source as atypical memory B cells (AMBCs). Additional BCR and TCR analyses revealed a high level of clonal expansion in patients with severe COVID-19, especially of B lymphocytes, and the clonally expanded B cells highly expressed genes related to inflammatory responses and lymphocyte activation.

We conducted a phase 1b study of intravenous Daratumumab (16 mg/kg) with weekly subcutaneous bortezomib (1.3-1.5 mg/m 2 ), cyclophosphamide (150-300 mg/m 2), and dexamethasone (40 mg) (CyBorD-DARA) as induction before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), followed by CyBorD-DARA consolidation (2 cycles) and monthly DARA +/- bortezomib (in high-risk disease) maintenance for 24 months. We hypothesized that the addition of cyclophosphamide could lead to enhanced antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02955810. We previously reported the initial results of this study. 1. In addition to a favourable safety profile we observed promising anti-MM activity with 10 of 13 patients (77%) in whom assessment was possible achieving measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity at a sensitivity of 10 -5 by next generation sequencing (NGS) after ASCT. We now report the results at EOT, with a focus on MRD. Eligible patients were 70 years of age with untreated transplant-eligible MM. 18 patients were enrolled. Median age was 56.5 years (range, 32-66 years), 61% were male and 94% of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1. The International Staging System stages were I, II, and III in 78%, 17%, and 6% of patients, respectively. 29% of patients had high-risk genetic features by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) or gene expression profiling, including 17p deletion in 12% and t(4;14) and t(14;16) in 6% each. On an ITT basis, the rates of very good partial remission or better (VGPR) after ASCT, consolidation and at end of treatment (EOT) (after completion of 24 months of DARA) were 94%, 94% and 81% respectively, and rates of complete response or better (CR) were 50%, 63% and 63% respectively. Measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment was possible in 13 patients after induction, ASCT and consolidation, and 10 at EOT. Sustained MRD negativity (ie. MRD negativity after ASCT, consolidation and at EOT) to a level of 10 -5 by NGS was achieved in 33% (ITT). Of 13 patients who remained on study at EOT in VGPR or better, 54% were MRD negative (MRD was unavailable in 23%). 7 patients were MRD negative after both ASCT and consolidation. Of these patients, all evaluable at EOT(6/7) remained MRD negative, with 1 patient unable to undergo MRD assessment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but remaining in CR. Nausea and diarrhoea occurred in 89% of patients, but were mostly grade 1-2 (Grade 3 nausea 17%;diarrhoea 6%). Neutropenia occurred in 44% (Grade 3 17%), anaemia in 39% (Grade 3 22%), and thrombocytopenia in 33% (Grade 3 22%). The rate of neutropenic sepsis was 11%. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 50% (Grade 3 6%) and peripheral neuropathy occurred in 33% (Grade 3 0%) The most commonly reported serious adverse event (SAE) was sepsis in 22%. One patient developed abnormal liver function tests leading to discontinuation from the trial. CyBorD-DARA induction, consolidation and DARA-maintenance is an effective and well-tolerated IMiD free regimen in transplant-eligible patients with MM. MRD negativity at a level of > 10 -5 after ASCT and consolidation may be predictive of sustained MRD negativity at EOT. References: 1. Naicker SD, et al.

The risks and environmental concerns are associated with the fact that faeces of wild and domesticated animals constitute the largest source of environmental loading of enteropathogens associated with transmission of zoonotic diseases (enteric zoonoses). Although sick animals are more likely to transmit pathogens, healthy ones can also be the carriers and defecate them into the environment. This is of particular importance given the close human-animal interactions and health effects resulting from human and ecological exposures to faecal hazards from companion and farm animals.

At the time of this study, the number of daily new cases in the United States was greater than that in any other country, and the trend was increasing in most states. Google Trends provides data regarding public interest in various topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods may provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to consider the predictive ability of different search terms not directly related to COVID-19 with regard to the increase of daily cases in the United States. In particular, we are concerned with searches related to dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface and the COVID-19 Tracking Project. METHODS: To test the causation of one time series on another, we used the Granger causality test. We considered the causation of two different search query trends related to dine-in restaurants and bars on daily positive cases in the US states and territories with the 10 highest and 10 lowest numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19. In addition, we used Pearson correlations to measure the linear relationships between different trends. RESULTS: Our results showed that for states and territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which mainly occurred after reopening, significantly affected the number of daily new cases on average. California, for example, showed the most searches for restaurants on June 7, 2020; this affected the number of new cases within two weeks after the peak, with a P value of .004 for the Granger causality test. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases in US states and territories with higher numbers of daily new cases. We showed that these influential search trends can be used to provide additional information for prediction tasks regarding new cases in each region.

We assessed association between therapeutic anticoagulation administration with unfractionated heparin and outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, assuming that anticoagulant administration effects are influenced by therapy timing. Methods This retrospective observational study included severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in a tertiary emergency critical care hospital intensive care unit (ICU) in Japan from May 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. All included patients were divided into early and late-phase administration groups based on therapeutic anticoagulant administration timing (5 and > 5 days, respectively, after commencing oxygen therapy). Primary outcomes (in-hospital mortality and adverse events related to anticoagulation therapy) and secondary outcomes [veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventilator-free days (VFD), and ICU-free days] were compared between groups using univariate and multivariate models. Results Of 198 included patients 104 (52.5%) and 94 (47.5%) were in early-phase and late-phase administration groups, respectively. Although background characteristics were similar between the groups, the early-phase administration group had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate (3.8% vs. 27.7%; p < 0.001), lower adverse event rates (1.9% vs. 12.8%; p < 0.001), significantly longer VFD and ICU-free days, and lower ECMO rates, than the late-phase administration group, in the multivariate model.

METHODS: One hundred and forty-six patients who underwent esophagectomy between 1995 and 2011 for stage II and III cancer were selected and separated into open esophagectomy (Open) and MIE groups. Risk adjustment was performed using the CCI-G. The outcomes of interest were operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), lymph node harvest, length of hospital stay (LOS), major complications, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (44 %) underwent Open while 71 (49 %) had MIE. An additional (7 %) were converted and classified with MIE. There was no significant difference between MIE and Open in terms of operative time. MIE had less EBL (mean difference = 234 mL, p < 0.001), higher lymph node harvest (mean = 7.4 nodes, p < 0.001), and shorter LOS (median = 1.5 days, p = 0.02). Atrial arrhythmias were the most frequent complication, occurring in 33 % of patients in both the MIE and the Open group (p = 0.988). Thirty-day mortality was 2 % for MIE and 5 % for Open (p = 0.459). Five-year survival was 41 % for MIE and 33 % for Open (p = 0.513). Operative approach, age, gender, BMI, clinical stage, and neoadjuvant therapy did not have any significant effect on the outcomes or overall survival. CCI-G influenced outcomes with operative time, LOS, cardiovascular complication, and anastomotic leak rate, favoring CCI-G 0 compared to CCI-G 3.

This work characterized orally administered abrocitinib population pharmacokinetics in healthy individuals, patients with psoriasis, and patients with AD and the effects of covariates on abrocitinib exposure. METHODS Abrocitinib concentration measurements (n = 6206) from 995 individuals from 11 clinical trials (seven phase I, two phase II, and two phase III) were analyzed, and a non-linear mixed-effects model was developed. Simulations of abrocitinib dose proportionality and steady-state accumulation of maximal plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were conducted using the final model. RESULTS A two-compartment model with parallel zero- and first-order absorption, time-dependent bioavailability, and time- and dose-dependent clearance best described abrocitinib pharmacokinetics. Abrocitinib coadministration with rifampin resulted in lower exposure, whereas Asian/other race coadministration with fluconazole and fluvoxamine, inflammatory skin conditions (psoriasis/AD), and hepatic impairment resulted in higher exposure. After differences in body weight are accounted for, Asian participants demonstrated a 1.43- and 1.48-fold increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively. The overall distribution of exposures (Cmax and AUC) was similar in adolescents and adults after accounting for differences in total body weight. CONCLUSIONS A population pharmacokinetics model was developed for abrocitinib that can be used to predict abrocitinib steady-state exposure in the presence of drug-drug interaction effects or intrinsic patient factors. Key covariates in the study population accounting for variability in abrocitinib exposures are Asian race and adolescent age, although these factors are not clinically meaningful.

Thus, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to candidiasis, including strategies bioinspired by insights into natural host defense against fungal pathogens. The antifungal properties of -defensins, macrocyclic peptides expressed in tissues of Old World monkeys, were investigated against a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Rhesus -defensin 1 (RTD-1), the prototype -defensin, was rapidly and potently fungicidal against drug-sensitive and MDR C. albicans strains. Fungal killing occurred by cell permeabilization that was temporally correlated with ATP release and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Killing by RTD-1 was compared with that by histatin 5 (Hst 5), an extensively characterized anticandidal peptide expressed in human saliva. RTD-1 killed C. albicans much more rapidly and at a >200-fold lower concentration than that of Hst 5. Unlike Hst 5, the anticandidal activity of RTD-1 was independent of mitochondrial ATP production. Moreover, RTD-1 was completely resistant to Candida proteases for 2 h under conditions that rapidly and completely degraded Hst 5.

Besides the classic symptom of painfully swollen parotid salivary glands (parotitis) in mumps virus (MuV)-infected men, orchitis is the most common form of extra-salivary gland inflammation. Mumps orchitis frequently occurs in young adult men, and leads to pain and swelling of the testis. The administration of MuV vaccines in children has been proven highly effective in reducing the incidence of mumps. However, a recent global outbreak of mumps and the high rate of orchitis have recently been considered as threats to male fertility. The pathogenesis of mumps orchitis remains largely unclear due to lack of systematic clinical data analysis and animal models studies. The alarming increase in the incidence of mumps orchitis and the high risk of the male fertility have thus become a major health concern. Recent studies have revealed the mechanisms by which MuV-host cells interact and MuV infection induces inflammatory responses in testicular cells.

Based on experimental evidence, peptides were used for in silico analysis to check the inhibitory activity of the main protease (PDB: 7BQY) of SARS-CoV-2. The results of the study reveal that PTR (-46.16 Kcal/mol) showed higher binding affinity than APDG (-36.80 Kcal/mol) and AD (-30.24 Kcal/mol) compared to Remdesivir (-30.64 Kcal/mol). Additionally, physicochemical characteristics of all the isolated peptides exhibited appropriate pharmacological properties and were found to be nontoxic. Besides, 20 ns molecular dynamic simulation study confirms the rigid nature, fewer confirmation variations and binding stiffness of the peptide PTR with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, the activity of DHAV-1 in the cells caused obvious eIF2 phosphorylation, which has nothing to do with the viral protein. Subsequently, we screened two kinases (PERK and GCN2) that affect eIF2 phosphorylation through inhibitors and shRNA. Notably, the role of GCN2 in other picornaviruses has not been reported. In addition, when the phosphorylation of eIF2 induced by DHAV-1 is inhibited, the translation efficiency of DEFs restores to a normal level, indicating that DHAV-1 induced cellular translation shutoff is dependent on eIF2 phosphorylation.","output":"Duck Hepatitis A Virus Type 1 Induces eIF2 Phosphorylation-Dependent Cellular Translation Shutoff via PERK/GCN2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 35(3) of Applied Cognitive Psychology (see record 2021-45270-013).

Since automation of systems has become increasingly complex and ubiquitous, troubleshooting skills are crucial to maintain safety and security in a variety of contexts. The planned study aims at examining troubleshooting strategies and how to induce them by means of simple visual aids and concise instructions. To this end, a computerized task consisting of network troubleshooting problems will be employed in an experimental study with repeated measures. Indicators of strategy use and performance will be tested for their relation to availability and differential use of visual aids, to cognitive styles that affect how individuals deal with challenges or system information, and to cognitive processes that are involved in metacognition and executive function. The planned research is expected to help gain insights into the cognitive determinants of troubleshooting, reverse engineering, and their links to computational thinking.

Despite their heightened emotional distress, psychosocial resources are both limited and lack the specificity to meet the unique needs of both partners. Our aim was to gain an in-depth understanding of the psychosocial treatment preferences of persons with young-onset dementia and their partners-an important first step in developing a tailored intervention. We conducted semi-structured dyadic interviews with persons with young-onset dementia and their partners (N = 23) and used a hybrid deductive-inductive approach to thematic analysis. We identified 12 themes across four domains: (1) perceptions of available and lacking resources, (2) preferences for program content, (3) preferences for program format, and (4) barriers and facilitators to participation. Couples indicated there is a lack of specific and family-oriented resources, which can create more stress and relationship strain. Couples endorsed support for a virtual, dyadic intervention delivered shortly after diagnosis focused on providing tools to cope with difficult emotions and symptom progression and enhance communication and meaningful daily living. They also identified potential barriers to program participation and offered suggestions to promote engagement. By using a qualitative approach, we were able to gather nuanced information that can be used to directly inform a feasible, accepted, and person-centered psychosocial intervention for persons with young-onset dementia and their partners.","output":"Psychosocial treatment preferences of persons living with young-onset dementia and their partners."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new zoonotic infectious disease that was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and declared as a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. Due to the increased incidence of multimorbidity in geriatric age groups, COVID-19 disease leads to more severe consequences in the elderly. We aimed to determine the effects of age, comorbidity factors, symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiological results on prognosis by dividing our patients into 3 different geriatric age groups, using a retrospective descriptive analysis method. Patients included in the retrospective study (n = 483) were divided into the following three different geriatric age groups: young-old (65C74 years), middle-aged (75C84 years), and the oldest-elderly (85 years and over).The length of stay in the intensive care unit of the patients between the ages of 75C84 was higher than the other two groups (p = 0.013). Mortality rates were lowest in patients aged 65C74 years (p < 0.001). The rate of ground glass opacity in thorax CT was higher in patients with mortality (p < 0.001). While the rate of COPD-bronchial asthma was higher in surviving patients (p = 0.001), malignancy (p = 0.005) and cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001) were higher in patients who died. Patients aged between 75 and 84 (OR: 2.602; 95% CI: 1.306C5.183; p = 0.007) or  85 (OR: 4.086; 95% CI: 1.687C9.9; p = 0.002) had higher risk for mortality compared to patients aged between 65 and 74. The lowest mortality rates were observed in patients aged 65C74 years. Among the supportive diagnostic methods in 3 different geriatric age groups, PCR positivity has no effect on mortality, while the ground glass opacity on tomography is closely related to the need for intensive care and increased mortality.

Here, we identify an evolutionary conserved E-L-L motif present within the HR2 domain of all human and non-human coronavirus spike (S) proteins that play a crucial role in stabilizing the post-fusion six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure and thus, fusion-mediated viral entry. Mutations within this motif reduce the fusogenicity of the S protein without affecting its stability or membrane localization. We found that posaconazole, an FDA-approved drug, binds to this E-L-L motif resulting in effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells. While posaconazole exhibits high efficacy towards blocking S protein-mediated viral entry, mutations within the E-L-L motif rendered the protein completely resistant to the drug, establishing its specificity towards this motif. Our data demonstrate that posaconazole restricts early stages of infection through specific inhibition of membrane fusion and viral genome release into the host cell and is equally effective towards all major variants of concerns of SARS-CoV-2 including beta, kappa, delta, and omicron. Together, we show that this conserved essential E-L-L motif is an ideal target for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Targeting an evolutionarily conserved E-L-L motif in the spike protein to develop a small molecule fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of daily life.

Alcohol-related harm can be reduced by interventions, such as taxation, government monopolising retail sales, outlet density restriction, hours of sales and an advertising ban. To mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, SA instituted a lockdown that also prohibited alcohol sales. This led to a sharp reduction in unnatural deaths in the country from 800-1000/week to around 400/week during the lockdown.

Objectives: This review was informed by the following clinical question: Is providing intervention remotely through telehealth as efficacious and effective as in-person therapy for treating CAS? Methods, eligibility criteria, and sources of evidence: Eight databases and seven search engines were searched for articles to identify intervention studies that have investigated the efficacy and/or effectiveness of treating CAS remotely. Search criteria was restricted to papers with children under 18 years of age, published in the English language between 1993 and 2020. Results: Two studies were found to meet our inclusion criteria. A phase I study employed a multiple baseline across participants design to investigate the efficacy of the Rapid Syllable Transition treatment via telehealth. The second study assessed the feasibility of adopting a novel system for the remote administration of the Nuffield Dyspraxia Program-Third Edition.

In the present report, we demonstrate that F(ab')2 [but not F(ab')1] fragments of a cross-linking mAb have similar effects. Hence, cross-linking activity, but not the Fc domain of the mAb, is needed for increased antiviral activity. In contrast, the Fc domain of the mAb was important for increasing viral uptake or respiratory burst responses of human neutrophils. Our NCRD constructs contain an S protein binding site.

Based on motifs found in these serum collectins, we have constructed mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD that have increased antiviral activity. These mutant NCRDs also had potentiated activity after cross-linking with F(ab')2 fragments or S protein complexes. Hence, the antiviral activity of NCRDs can be increased by 2 distinct, complementary strategies, namely cross-linking of NCRDs through various means and mutagenesis of CRD residues to increase viral binding.

Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 C to 29 C and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated. The numerical predictions may be used to determine the impact of the droplet size and the ambient conditions on the transmission risks of infectious diseases like COVID-19.","output":"Insights into the evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets and aerosols: Levitation experiments and numerical modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Drug repurposing is a relevant approach during the COVID-19 pandemic, because development of new drugs is time-consuming and costly, and the safety of new drugs is paramount Drug repurposing focuses on researching new indications for existing drugs and can reduce the challenges faced in drug development Objective: The current review intended to examine the current status of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases to find abstracts of relevant articles in journals published from 2010 until May 16, 2020 The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect The search terms used included repositioning of drugs, repurposing of drugs and COVID-19 therapy, and SARS-CoV-2 therapy Setting: The research team conducted this study at the Department of Pharmacology, Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan;Mangalbare Hospital, Morang, Nepal;and Dr Iwamura Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal Results: Repurposing of drugs from different pharmacological groups including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, arbidol, oseltamivir, penciclovir, favipiravir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin;other antibiotics like azithromycin, ivermectin, eravacycline, valrubicin, streptomycin, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, caspofungin, and colistin;and other agents like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab, camostat, nafamostat, carfilzomib, interferon, aprepitant, and dexamethasone can be considered for COVID-19 therapy Conclusions: Although current results are promising, limitations to drug repurposing, such as a low success rate and the possibility of adverse events, can't be overlooked With continuous research and technical advancements, repurposing will no doubt provide a notable scientific contribution to innovation in drug development and pharmacotherapy practice for the treatment of new diseases or existing diseases in a new way","output":"Repurposing Drugs for COVID-19: An Approach for Treatment in the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as imaging probes and therapeutic probes in recent years due to their excellent optical properties.

Fungi, particularly mushrooms, are the principal source of naturally occurring psychedelics.

Psychedelic use was largely associated with the \\"hippie\\" counterculture movement, which, in turn, resulted in a growing, and still lingering, negative stigmatization for psychedelics. As a result, in 1970, the U.S. government rescheduled psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs, ultimately ending scientific research on psychedelics. This prohibition on psychedelic drug research significantly delayed advances in medical knowledge on the therapeutic uses of agents such as psilocybin.

Following encouraging clinical results of subunit vaccination and revaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG), it has been suggested to combine BCG and subunit vaccines for increased efficacy. Current subunit vaccines are almost exclusively designed as BCG boosters. The goal of this study was to design a subunit vaccine that does not share antigens with BCG and explore the advantages of a BCG+subunit vaccine co-administration strategy, where the two vaccines do not cross-react. Eight protective antigens were selected to create a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific subunit vaccine, named H107. Whereas subunit vaccines with BCG-shared antigens displayed cross-reactivity to BCG in vivo in both mice and humans, H107 showed no cross-reactivity and did not inhibit BCG colonization in mice. Encouragingly, co-administering H107 with BCG (BCG+H107) led to increased adaptive immune responses against both H107 and BCG leading to improved BCG-mediated immunity. In contrast to subunit vaccines with BCG-shared antigens, boosting BCG with H107 led to substantial expansion of clonal diversity in the T cell repertoire, and BCG+H107 co-administration conferred significantly increased Th17 responses and less differentiated CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells induced by BCG+H107 maintained functional superiority after Mtb infection, and BCG+H107 provided significantly increased long-term protection compared to both BCG and H107 alone, as well as, BCG co-administered with a subunit vaccine composed of antigens shared with BCG. Overall, we identify several advantages of combining an Mtb-specific subunit vaccine with BCG and introduce H107 as a BCG-complementing vaccine with distinctive value for co-administration with BCG.","output":"A novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific subunit vaccine provides synergistic immunity upon co-administration with Bacillus Calmette-Gurin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate a risk score using variables available during an Emergency Department (ED) encounter to predict adverse events among patients with suspected COVID-19.

Sex-differences were expressed as differences in excess mortality incidence rates. A general relation between sex-differences and overall excess mortality both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preceding seasons were investigated. Results Data from 27 European countries were included, covering the seasons 2016/17 to 2019/20. In periods with increased excess mortality, excess was consistently highest among males. From February through May 2020 male excess mortality was 52.7 (95% PI: 56.29;49.05) deaths per 100,000 person years higher than for females. Increased male excess mortality compared to female was also observed in the seasons 2016/17 to 2018/19. We found a linear relation between sex-differences in excess mortality and overall excess mortality, i.e., 40 additional deaths among males per 100 excess deaths per 100,000 population. This corresponds to an overall female/male mortality incidence ratio of 0.7. Conclusion In situations with overall excess mortality, excess mortality increases more for males than females.

STRATEGIES: Through a committed and collaborative effort from all healthcare related disciplines and its professional societies from both public and private sector, the Kerala Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been able to deliver a state-wide strategy to tackle AMR A multilevel strategic leadership model and a multilevel implementation approach that included developing state-wide antibiotic clinical guidelines, a revision of post-graduate and undergraduate medical curriculum, and a training program covering all general practitioners within the state the PPP proved to be a successful model for ensuring state-wide implementation of an AMR action plan. Collaborative work of multi-professional groups ensured co-design and development of disease based clinical treatment guidelines and state-wide infection prevention policy. Knowledge exchange though international and national platforms in the form of workshops for sharing of best practices is critical to success.

It has been used to categorize the severity of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) infection. Our study aimed to use chest CT-angiogram (CTA) to assess if increased RV dilation, quantified as an increased RV:LV (left ventricle) ratio, is associated with adverse outcomes in the COVID-19 infection, and if it occurs out of proportion to lung parenchymal disease. RESULTS: We reviewed clinical, laboratory, and chest CTA findings in COVID-19 patients (n = 100), and two control groups: normal subjects (n = 10) and subjects with organizing pneumonia (n = 10). On a chest CTA, we measured basal dimensions of the RV and LV in a focused 4-chamber view, and dimensions of pulmonary artery (PA) and aorta (AO) at the PA bifurcation level. Among the COVID-19 cohort, a higher RV:LV ratio was correlated with adverse outcomes, defined as ICU admission, intubation, or death. In patients with adverse outcomes, the RV:LV ratio was 1.06  0.10, versus 0.95  0.15 in patients without adverse outcomes. Among the adverse outcomes group, compared to the control subjects with organizing pneumonia, the lung parenchymal damage was lower (22.6  9.0 vs. 32.7  6.6), yet the RV:LV ratio was higher (1.06  0.14 vs. 0.89  0.07). In ROC analysis, RV:LV ratio had an AUC = 0.707 with an optimal cutoff of RV:LV  1.1 as a predictor of adverse outcomes. In a validation cohort (n = 25), an RV:LV  1.1 as a cutoff predicted adverse outcomes with an odds ratio of 76:1.

METHODS Women with symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse who opted for either LSHP or VH were included. Subjective outcomes were compared at 1 and 2 years from baseline using the validated questionnaires. Objective/anatomical outcomes using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system were assessed before and at 3 months after surgery. Adverse events, recurrent prolapse, and new-onset SUI was recorded up to 2 years. RESULTS The study assessed 226 women with uterovaginal prolapse; 125 opted for surgery (44 LSHP, 81 VH). There was no statistically significant difference in symptom domains between groups at baseline and 1 and 2 years. At 3 months POP-Q, greater improvement was seen in points Ba and Ap in the LSHP group compared to VH group and smaller genital hiatus was seen in the VH group.

The majority of biopharmaceuticals are based on human glycoproteins, but non-human glycoproteins, originating from for instance parasitic worms (helminths), form an untapped pool of potential therapeutics for immune-related diseases and vaccine candidates. The production of sufficient quantities of correctly glycosylated putative therapeutic helminth proteins is often challenging and requires extensive engineering of the glycosylation pathway. Therefore, a flexible glycoprotein production system is required that allows straightforward introduction of heterologous glycosylation machinery composed of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases to obtain desired glycan structures. The glycome of plants creates an ideal starting point for N- and O-glyco-engineering of helminth glycans. Plants are also tolerant toward the introduction of heterologous glycosylation enzymes as well as the obtained glycans. Thus, a potent production platform emerges that enables the production of recombinant helminth proteins with unusual glycans. In this review, we discuss recent advances in plant glyco-engineering of potentially therapeutic helminth glycoproteins, challenges and their future prospects.","output":"Glyco-Engineering Plants to Produce Helminth Glycoproteins as Prospective Biopharmaceuticals: Recent Advances, Challenges and Future Prospects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report the clinical findings, outcome, and complications associated with urethrotomy performed in combination with or after temporary tube cystostomy for treatment of obstructive urolithiasis in male goats. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SAMPLE POPULATION Castrated male goats (n = 15). METHODS The medical records of male goats admitted for obstructive urolithiasis were reviewed. Goats that underwent aurethrotomy performed in combination with or after a temporary tube cystostomy were included in the study population. Follow-up information was obtained through hospital records and telephone communication. RESULTS Thirteen of 15 goats were discharged from the hospital a median of 13 days (range, 7-25) after urethrotomy. Complications related to the urinary system occurred in 5 goats and included recurrent obstruction, urination from open urethrotomy, uroabdomen and intra-abdominal adhesions after removal of the Foley catheter, and incisional infection. Five of 7 goats with long-term follow-up (2-24 months after surgery) were healthy, with normal urinary function. The remaining 2 goats returned to the hospital with signs of reobstruction that were attributed to uroliths at necropsy in 1 goat. CONCLUSION Goats treated with urethrotomy for persistent urethral obstruction after temporary tube cystostomy generally survived the procedure. Normal long-term urinary function was obtained in some goats, although recurrence was the most common complication. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Urethrotomy is a surgical option for male goats with persistent urethral obstruction due to urethral calculi after temporary tube cystostomy.","output":"Urethrotomy in combination with or after temporary tube cystostomy for treatment of obstructive urolithiasis in male goats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The link between viral respiratory infection and non-pulmonary organ-specific injury, including cardiac injury, has become increasingly appreciated during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic, however, the association between acute infection with influenza and elevated cardiovascular risk was evident. The recently published results of the NHLBI-funded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop CardioThoracic Events and Decompensated (INVESTED) trial, a 5200 patient comparative effectiveness study of high-dose vs. standard-dose influenza vaccine to reduce cardiopulmonary events and mortality in a high-risk cardiovascular population, found no difference between strategies. However, the broader implications of influenza vaccine as a strategy to reduce morbidity in high-risk patients remain extremely important, with randomized controlled trial and observational data supporting vaccination in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Given a favourable risk-benefit profile and widespread availability at generally low cost, we contend that influenza vaccination should remain a centrepiece of cardiovascular risk mitigation and describe the broader context of underutilization of this strategy. Few therapeutics in medicine offer seasonal efficacy from a single administration with generally mild, transient side effects, and exceedingly low rates of serious adverse effects. Infection control measures such as physical distancing, hand washing, and the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic have already been associated with substantially curtailed incidence of influenza outbreaks across the globe. Appending annual influenza vaccination to these measures represents an important public health and moral imperative.","output":"Influenza vaccination: a 'shot' at INVESTing in cardiovascular health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Most of the currently used prognostic models for COVID-19 are based on Western cohorts, but it is unknown whether any are applicable to patients with COVID-19 in Japan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 160 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between January 26, 2020 and July 25, 2020. We searched PubMed for prognostic models for COVID-19. The predicted outcome was initiation of respiratory support or death. Performance of the candidate models was evaluated according to discrimination and calibration. We recalibrated the intercept of each model with our data. We also updated each model by adding ?2-microglobulin (?2MG) to the model and recalculating the intercept and the coefficient of ?2MG. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 49.8 years, 68% were male, 88.7% were Japanese. The study outcomes occurred in 15 patients, including two deaths. Two-hundred sixty-nine papers were screened, and four candidate prognostic models were assessed. The model of Bartoletti et al. had the highest area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.96). All four models overestimated the probability of occurrence of the outcome. None of the four models showed statistically significant improvement in AUCs by adding ?2MG. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the existing prediction models for COVID-19 overestimate the probability of occurrence of unfavorable outcomes in a Japanese cohort.

DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H2O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause.

Although IBS does not develop into a serious disease or increase mortality, it results in a considerable reduction in the quality of life. The etiology of IBS is not known, but the intestinal microbiota appears to play a pivotal role in its pathophysiology. There is no effective treatment for IBS, and so the applied treatments clinically focus on symptom relief. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), an old Chinese treatment, has been applied to IBS patients in seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Positive effects on IBS symptoms in various degrees were obtained in four of these RCTs, while there was no effect in the remaining three. Across the seven RCTs there were marked differences in the selection processes for the donor and treated patients, the transplant dose, the route of administration, and the methods used to measure how the patients responded to FMT. The present frontier discusses these differences and proposes: (1) criteria for selecting an effective donor (superdonor); (2) selection criteria for patients that are suitable for FMT; (3) the optimal FMT dose; and (4) the route of transplant administration. FMT appears to be safe, with only mild, self-limiting side effects of abdominal pain, cramping, tenderness, diarrhea, and constipation. Although it is early to speculate about the mechanisms underlying the effects of FMT, the available data suggest that changes in the intestinal bacteria accompanied by changes in fermentation patterns and fermentation products (specifically short-chain fatty acids) play an important role in improving the IBS symptoms seen after FMT. FMT appears to be a promising treatment for IBS, but further studies are needed before it can be applied in everyday clinical practice.","output":"Fecal microbiota transplantation for irritable bowel syndrome: An intervention for the 21(st) century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isospora spp. are the causative agents of canine isosporosis.

RESULTS: Of 472 946 participants alive when COVID-19 was first apparent in the UK (taken as 1 February 2020), 217 (34% women) died from COVID-19 over the next 10 months, resulting in an incidence, per 100 000 person years, of 100.65 (95% CI 79.47 to 121.84) for women and 228.59 (95% CI 194.88 to 262.30) for men. Greater social deprivation, quantified using the Townsend Deprivation Score, was associated with greater risk of fatal COVD-19. Adjusted for age and ethnicity, HRs for women and men, comparing those in the most with the least deprived national fifths, were 3.66 (2.82 to 4.75) for women and 3.00 (2.46 to 3.66) for men.

Persistent fatigue in COVID-19 patients is frequently accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms; however, less is known about the relationships between these components of post-COVID-19 condition and fatigue itself. Consequently, the present study sought to (1) distinguish the types of fatigue experienced by participants, and (2) investigate whether cognitive deficits across various domains and neuropsychiatric conditions predicted these different types of fatigue. The study included 136 COVID-19 patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation due to cognitive complaints 8 months on average after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measures included self-reported fatigue (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), neuropsychiatric questionnaires (assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, apathy, and executive functioning), a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and self-reported quality of life and everyday functioning. Results showed that reports of clinical significant fatigue were pervasive in our sample (82.3% of participants), with physical fatigue rated highest on average relative to the subscale maximum. Elevated levels of apathy, anxiety, and executive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric measures along with executive and attentional difficulties on cognitive tests were found to be consistently important predictors among different types of fatigue.

Several vaccine candidates have entered phase 3 of the clinical trial and are being investigated to provide immunity to the maximum percentage of people. A safe and effective vaccine is required to tackle the current COVID-19 waves. There have been reports that clinical endpoints and psychological parameters are necessary to consider vaccine efficacy. This review examines the clinical endpoints required for a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the influences of psychological parameters on its efficacy. METHODS: The main research question was to find out the clinical endpoints that determine the vaccine efficacy? And what kind of psychological parameters affect the vaccine efficacy? The information was taken from several journals, databases, and scientific search engines like Googe scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science direct, WHO website, and other various sites. The research studies were searched using keywords; SARCoV-2 vaccine efficacy, psychological effect on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine endpoints. RESULTS: This review has highlighted various clinical endpoints that are the main determinants of clinical vaccine efficacy. Currently, vaccinations are being carried out throughout the world; it is important to investigate the main determinants affecting vaccine efficacy. We have focused on the clinical endpoints and the influence of psychological parameters that affect the vaccine efficacy in clinical settings. The primary endpoints include the risk of infection, symptoms, and severity of COVID-19, while hospitalization length, supplemental oxygen requirement, and mechanical ventilation are secondary endpoints in the clinical endpoints. Some tangential endpoints were also considered, including organ dysfunction, stroke, and MI. Many psychological associated things have influenced the vaccine efficacy, like the lower antibody titers in the vaccinated people. In addition to that, Short- and long-term stress and sleep deprivation were also found to affect the vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSION: The review summarizes the important clinical endpoints required for a successful vaccine candidate. In addition to primary and secondary endpoints, auxiliary endpoints and the disease burden also play an important role in modulating vaccine efficacy. Moreover, the psychological perspective also influences vaccine efficacy.

Due to the rise of social media as an important mode of communication recently, peoples views can be found on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. This study uses a Twitter dataset containing 17,155 tweets about e-learning. Machine learning and deep learning approaches have shown their suitability, capability, and potential for image processing, object detection, and natural language processing tasks and text analysis is no exception. Machine learning approaches have been largely used both for annotation and text and sentiment analysis. Keeping in view the adequacy and efficacy of machine learning models, this study adopts TextBlob, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), and SentiWordNet to analyze the polarity and subjectivity score of tweets text. Furthermore, bearing in mind the fact that machine learning models display high classification accuracy, various machine learning models have been used for sentiment classification. Two feature extraction techniques, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BoW (Bag of Words) have been used to effectively build and evaluate the models. All the models have been evaluated in terms of various important performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results reveal that the random forest and support vector machine classifier achieve the highest accuracy of 0.95 when used with Bow features. Performance comparison is carried out for results of TextBlob, VADER, and SentiWordNet, as well as classification results of machine learning models and deep learning models such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), CNN-LSTM, and Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional-LSTM). Additionally, topic modeling is performed to find the problems associated with e-learning which indicates that uncertainty of campus opening date, childrens disabilities to grasp online education, and lagging efficient networks for online education are the top three problems.","output":"Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on Tweets about Online Education during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intricate sequence and antigenic variability of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) have led to unprecedented difficulties in the development of vaccines. Much experimental evidence demonstrates that ALV-J mutants have caused immune evasion and pose a challenge for traditional efforts to develop effective vaccines. To investigate the potential of a multi-epitope vaccination strategy to prevent chickens against ALV-J infections, a recombinant chimeric multi-epitope protein X (rCMEPX) containing both immunodominant B and T epitope concentrated domains selected from the major structural protein of ALV-J using bioinformatics approach was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3). Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy was studied in chickens. The results showed that rCMEPX could elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses, and antibodies induced by rCMEPX could specifically recognize host cell naturally expressed ALV-J proteins, which indicated that the rCMEPX is a good immunogen. Challenge experiments showed 80% chickens that received rCMEPX were well protected against ALV-J challenge.

Using an interdisciplinary team approach, we created a clinical team to proactively screen and outreach patients with COVID-19 to equitably offer Mab. Methods From December 28, 2020 - May 3, 2021, a clinical team consisting of an Infectious disease pharmacist and physician, reviewed each outpatient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at the Atlanta VA Healthcare System (AVAHCS) daily. The clinical team used the published Emergency Use Authorization criteria to determine eligibility. Eligible patients were prioritized using the Veterans Health Administration (VACO) Index for COVID-19 Mortality, which estimates the risk of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection using pre-COVID-19 health status (Figure 1). Eligible patients were contacted via telephone to confirm eligibility and obtain verbal consent. We performed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests when possible prior to Mab infusion, but results did not preclude Mab receipt. Telehealth follow-up occurred at 1- and 7-days post infusion. Figure 1.

Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the educational fraternity has successfully reached out to the students using the various virtual tools available. Although, the offline mode of teaching-learning i.e. the actual classroom interaction is quite important as far as a technical course is concerned, but during these tough times the online platforms like Zoom, Webex meetings, Google meet have made the teaching-learning feasible remotely at any time from any place. This paper compares the learning behaviour of students in the two modes, online mode, and offline mode. A total of 213 students studying a technical course participated in the survey and their responses based on a questionnaire were recorded. The questionnaire considered all aspects related to the delivery of contents, the evaluation method, the preferred way of clarifying students doubts, course difficulty level and duration of the course. The analysis suggests that 72.3% of students are in favour of learning this course using offline mode, while 27.7 % of students are comfortable with online mode. Furthermore, the present study reveals that 95.7%, 95.3%, and 75.1 % of students are congenial with the offline mode in terms of teacher competency, content delivery, and interaction possibility respectively, whereas 85%, 76.9% and 48.4% of students are congenial with the online mode in terms of same parameters. The higher magnitude of average mean value for offline mode (3.99) anticipates its dominance over online mode (3.18). More than 50% students favoured online mode along with multiple choice question papers for the evaluation process irrespective of their preference to offline mode for teaching-learning. Based on the present analysis, some recommendations are proposed as the future strategies to improve the performance of teaching-learning activities during the times of crisis.","output":"Predicting the students' learning behaviour for a technical course during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented amount of face mask consumption around the world The increase in face mask consumption has brought focus to their environmental impact To keep up with the increased demand for face masks, different variations of reusable face masks such as the embedded filtration layer (EFL) reusable face mask have emerged in the market This study quantifies the environmental impact of the EFL reusable face mask and the single-use surgical face mask Methods The life cycle assessment (LCA) study of the entire value chain from cradle-to-grave is applied to each face mask Both face masks are evaluated over 1 functional unit (FU) of 31 12-h days for a single person The ReCiPe method with the Hierachist perspective was applied A total of nine impact categories as well as the generated waste of each face mask are evaluated Results The results show that for 1 functional unit, the use of single-use surgical face mask and EFL reusable face mask will contribute 0 580 kg CO2-eq and 0 338 kg CO2-eq to climate change and generate 0 004 kg and 0 0004 kg of waste respectively Conclusion Comparing both face masks, the EFL reusable face mask will have a lower emission of at least 30% in terms of the generated waste and the impact categories considered, except for water depletion, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and human toxicity","output":"Life cycle assessment of single-use surgical and embedded filtration layer (EFL) reusable face mask"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The human ACE2 enzyme serves as a critical first recognition point of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

In this work, using several all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show persistent differences in the ACE2 structure upon binding. These differences are determined with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) machine learning method and validated using independent training and testing datasets, including long trajectories generated by D. E. Shaw Research on the Anton 2 supercomputer. In addition, long trajectories for 78 potent ACE2-binding compounds, also generated by D. E. Shaw Research, were projected onto the LDA classification vector in order to determine whether the ligand-bound ACE2 structures were compatible with S1 protein binding.

Clinical and routine laboratory data were obtained, circulating cytokines (INF-, TNF-, and IL-10) and endothelial injury markers (E-Selectin, Tissue Factor (TF) and von Willebrand factor (vWF)) were measured. Compared to the SEPSIS group, patients with severe COVID-19 present similar clinical and laboratory data, except for lower circulating IL-10 and E-Selectin levels. Compared to the MILD group, patients in the SEVERE group showed higher levels of TNF-, IL-10, and TF. There was no clear relationship between cytokines and endothelial injury markers among the three studied groups; however, in SEVERE COVID-19 patients, there is a positive relationship between INF- with TF and a negative relationship between IL-10 and vWF.

The number of patients is increasing worldwide. Pneumonia is the most life-threatening complication of the disease. Prolonged viral shedding in hematological patients with COVID-19 has been demonstrated; however, data on COVID-19 patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy are limited. Accordingly, focusing on humoral immunity, herein, we present 4 COVID-19 patients who were on anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment and had prolonged pneumonia. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two of 4 patients were on rituximab and the other 2 were on obinutuzumab therapy. DIAGNOSIS: The polymerase chain reaction test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were positive for all 4 patients and their COVID pneumonia lasted for >50 days. INTERVENTIONS: Although all patients were treated with an adequate amount of convalescent plasma, prolonged polymerase chain reaction positivity and prolonged pneumonia were possibly due to the lack of ability of the immune system to initiate its antibody response. OUTCOMES: Despite the administration of standard therapies, recurrent pneumonia observed in the present case series of non-neutropenic patients, in whom primary malignancies were under control.

The expelled droplets can measure between 0.4$ and 450 m. Once the droplets are in the air, they are subject to the gravitational, and air frictional forces. Assuming a calm environment, i.e, no air currents, we solve numerically, to a very high accuracy, the coupled differential equations of motion, in two dimensions. We calculated, the residence time and the horizontal range, among other quantities, as a function of drop size and initial velocity, for particles expelled by a person at a height of 1.6 m. In the aerosol regime, i.e. sizes between 0.4$ and 5 m, the drag forces quickly stop the droplets in their horizontal movement and they fall extremely slowly, almost vertically, pulled down by the gravitational force. The residence time is, in that size, 3.83 days to 33.3 minutes. The droplets with a diameter of 100 m, can take 3.28 s, to reach the ground at a horizontal distance of 57 cm. Finally, the most massive droplets, with sizes of 450 m$, may take only 0.67 s and fall 3.67 m away from the source. By modeling the production of the number of saliva droplets with log-log Gaussian distributions in the size range 0.4 - 450 m, the amount of virions expelled into the environment is estimated. Since those droplets remain suspended for a very long time, they can be carried very easily by air currents. Since recent studies show that the use of face masks reduce drastically the amount of droplets emitted to the air by an infected person and inhaled by a healthy one, we emphasize the great importance of using adequate face protection to minimize COVID-19, transmission.","output":"Why size matters - the transport of expelled saliva droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caregivers of individuals with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic are faced with the demands of cancer and the health needs produced by it, along with their own health and self-care needs, and the uncertainties of expectations and risks.

Health information technologies (HITs) show promising potential to overcome these barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify how best to improve a mental health and well-being HIT for culturally diverse Australians in nonurban areas. METHODS: We conducted 10 co-design workshops (N=105 participants) in primary youth mental health services across predominantly nonurban areas of Australia and conducted template analysis on the workshop outputs. Owing to local (including service) demographics, the workshop participants naturalistically reflected culturally diverse groups. RESULTS: We identified 4 main themes: control, usability, affirmation, and health service delivery factors. The first 3 themes overlap with the 3 basic needs postulated by self-determination theory (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and describe participant recommendations on how to design an HIT. The final theme includes barriers to adopting HITs for mental health care and how HITs can be used to support care coordination and delivery. Hence, it describes participant recommendations on how to use an HIT. CONCLUSIONS: Although culturally diverse groups have specific concerns, their expressed needs fall broadly within the relatively universal design principles identified in this study. The findings of this study provide further support for applying self-determination theory to the design of HITs and reflect the tension in designing technologies for complex problems that overlap multiple medical, regulatory, and social domains, such as mental health care.

In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family. RESULTS: Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family.

After segmenting the words of the collected text, we used a topic modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to identify the most common topics posted by users. We analyzed the emotional tendencies of the topics, calculated the proportional distribution of the topics, performed user behavior analysis on the topics using data collected from the number of likes, comments, and retweets, and studied the changes in user concerns and differences in participation between citizens living in different regions of mainland China. RESULTS: Based on the 203,191 eligible microblog posts collected, we identified 17 topics and grouped them into 8 themes. These topics were pandemic statistics, domestic epidemic, epidemics in other countries worldwide, COVID-19 treatments, medical resources, economic shock, quarantine and investigation, patients' outcry for help, work and production resumption, psychological influence, joint prevention and control, material donation, epidemics in neighboring countries, vaccine development, fueling and saluting antiepidemic action, detection, and study resumption. The mean sentiment was positive for 11 topics and negative for 6 topics. The topic with the highest mean of retweets was domestic epidemic, while the topic with the highest mean of likes was quarantine and investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns expressed by social media users are highly correlated with the evolution of the global pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has provided a platform for Chinese government departments and organizations to better understand public concerns and demands. Similarly, social media has provided channels to disseminate information about epidemic prevention and has influenced public attitudes and behaviors. Government departments, especially those related to health, can create appropriate policies in a timely manner through monitoring social media platforms to guide public opinion and behavior during epidemics.","output":"Concerns Expressed by Chinese Social Media Users During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of Sina Weibo Microblogging Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a great impact on the agricultural sector, especially in developing countries. In particular, it caused exceptional challenges to small and local-scale farmers. Field questionnaires and interviews were used to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on small-scale farmers in the Northern Nile Delta of Egypt. Agricultural farms in Southern Port Said City represent emerging agricultural communities on newly reclaimed land, while those in Damietta are stable agricultural communities (old land of the Nile Delta). The questionnaire was divided into four questions groups to identify and analyze the different reasons that contributed to the disruption of farming systems and the agricultural sector. These groups were farmers' data, the effect of COVID-19 on agriculture inputs, infection rates and precautionary measures against COVID-19, and potential measures and governmental policies for controlling the negative impacts of COVID-19 and achieving agricultural sustainability. Results showed that the effect of lockdown was slightly lower in Damietta as compared to Port Said. Although fertilizers and labors costs, as well as water availability near Port Said, was not considerably affected during the lockdown, the total income of the small-scale farmers' notability decreased. The reluctance of major traders to buy crop production and keep the required balance of cash during the pandemic dramatically affected the crop production selling prices. Results showed that in the absence of agricultural extensions possibilities, there is a lack of awareness toward improving agricultural practices and switching to smart irrigation systems as a way of saving water and increasing crop productivity. The resistance against applying new agricultural practices and switching to smart irrigation systems depends mainly on farmers' financial capability and the nature of agricultural land either old or new. Activating the agricultural extensions roles is considered a keystone for enhancing agricultural sustainability in small-scale farming not only in developing regions of Egypt but also in other similar agricultural communities worldwide.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Small-Scale Farming in Northeastern Nile Delta of Egypt and Learned Lessons for Water Conservation Potentials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality and challenged public health agencies and healthcare systems worldwide. In the U.S., physical distancing orders and other restrictions have had severe economic and societal consequences.

The World Health Organization has made recommendations to engage at risk populations and communicate accurate information about risk and prevention; to conduct contract tracing; and to support those affected by COVID-19. This Commentary highlights the ways in which an existing and cost-effective, but underutilized workforce, community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators, should be deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators have skills in community engagement and health communication and are able to gain the trust of vulnerable communities. Furthermore, many community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators have skills in assisting community members with meeting basic needs and with navigating public health and healthcare systems. Members of this workforce are more than prepared to conduct contact tracing. State, local, tribal, and territorial public health agencies and healthcare systems should be collaborating with national, state, and local organizations that represent and employ CHWs/non-clinical patient navigators to determine how to better mobilize this workforce to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many worksites around the world to limit access to non-essential workers. This has significantly reduced the ability for OHS professionals to access worksites for the purpose of providing safety services, forcing them to consider alternative ways to assess MSD injury risk using innovation and technology. Method: Two previously validated inertial measurement units (IMU's) and smartphone application were used to measure the worker's movements;one IMU was positioned on the worker's upper back, the other IMU on the worker's dominant upper arm and the smartphone application collected the data and recorded video. The IMU's were shipped to the worksite and the on-site manager was instructed how to download the smartphone App use the sensors to collect data via a video meeting. A cloud-based analytics platform was then used by the OHS professional to analyze the data and video to provide recommendations about injury risk management. Results: The on-site managers were able to collect high quality data and video of a variety of workers and tasks. This data enabled OHS professionals to assess MSD injury risk through the cloud-based platform without the need to visit the site.

South Carolina is one of the US states that reopened early, following which it experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9, 14, 28, 20, and 9 days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3%-74.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Using Twitter-based population mobility data could provide acceptable predictions of COVID-19 daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina.

This situation has changed drastically the pattern of human behavior, introducing a lifestyle with greater hygiene that makes necessary to use plastic packaging to cover products, utensils, and food, avoiding any risk of transmission. To combat the massive use of plastic it is necessary to activate the transition towards circular economies that make use of environmentally friendly plastics;this is the case of biopolymers, materials that can be synthesized from organic waste rich in starch. Therefore, in this work, the factors that affect the hardness of polymers made from potato and plantain peels are studied through a factorial experimental design. The design establishes the combination of urea, glycerine, acetic acid, and water, to identify the best combination of plasticizer and their effect on the hardness of the material.

Gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSIs) harboring such difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) may have higher mortality than phenotypes that allow for 1 active first-line antibiotic. Methods The Premier Database was analyzed for inpatients with select GNBSIs. DTR was defined as intermediate/resistant in vitro to all ?-lactam categories, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Prevalence and aminoglycoside resistance of DTR episodes were compared with carbapenem-resistant, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant, and fluoroquinolone-resistant episodes using CDC definitions. Predictors of DTR were identified. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of mortality was examined for DTR, CDC-defined phenotypes susceptible to 1 first-line agent, and graded loss of active categories. Results Between 2009-2013, 471 (1%) of 45011 GNBSI episodes at 92 (53.2%) of 173 hospitals exhibited DTR, ranging from 0.04% for Escherichia coli to 18.4% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Among patients with DTR, 79% received parenteral aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or colistin/polymyxin-B; resistance to all aminoglycosides occurred in 33%. Predictors of DTR included urban healthcare and higher baseline illness. Crude mortality for GNBSIs with DTR was 43%; aRR was higher for DTR than for carbapenem-resistant (1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.4; P = .02), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (1.2; 1.1-1.4; P = .001), or fluoroquinolone-resistant (1.2; 1.0-1.4; P = .008) infections. The mortality aRR increased 20% per graded loss of active first-line categories, from 3-5 to 1-2 to 0.

We aimed to estimate trends from 2002 to 2019 in life expectancy and probabilities of death at different ages for all 6791 middle-layer super output areas (MSOAs) in England. METHODS: We performed a high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil registration data from the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit research database using de-identified data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019, with information on age, sex, and MSOA of residence, and population counts by age, sex, and MSOA. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain estimates of age-specific death rates by sharing information across age groups, MSOAs, and years. We used life table methods to calculate life expectancy at birth and probabilities of death in different ages by sex and MSOA. FINDINGS: In 2002C06 and 2006C10, all but a few (0C1%) MSOAs had a life expectancy increase for female and male sexes. In 2010C14, female life expectancy decreased in 351 (52%) of 6791 MSOAs. By 2014C19, the number of MSOAs with declining life expectancy was 1270 (187%) for women and 784 (115%) for men. The life expectancy increase from 2002 to 2019 was smaller in MSOAs where life expectancy had been lower in 2002 (mostly northern urban MSOAs), and larger in MSOAs where life expectancy had been higher in 2002 (mostly MSOAs in and around London). As a result of these trends, the gap between the first and 99th percentiles of MSOA life expectancy for women increased from 107 years (95% credible interval 104C109) in 2002 to reach 142 years (139C145) in 2019, and for men increased from 115 years (113C117) in 2002 to 136 years (134C139) in 2019. INTERPRETATION: In the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic, life expectancy declined in increasing numbers of communities in England.

We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer, and D-dimer trends, among 1065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients, across 6 New York Hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Three-hundred-thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE.

Assessing the burden of COVID-19 is essential for developing efficient pandemic preparedness and response strategies and for determining the impact of implemented control measures. Population-based seroprevalence surveys are critical to estimate infection rates, monitor the progression of the epidemic and to allow for the identification of persons exposed to the infection who may either have been asymptomatic or were never tested. This is especially important for countries where effective testing and tracking systems could not be established and where non-severe cases or under-reported deaths might have blurred the true burden of COVID-19. Most seroprevalence surveys performed in sub-Saharan Africa have targeted specific high risk or more easily accessible populations such as healthcare workers or blood donors, and household-based estimates are rarely available. Here, we present the study protocol for a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimation in the general population of Burkina Faso, Ghana and Madagascar in 2021. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SeroCoV study is a household-based cross-sectional prevalence investigation in persons aged 10 years and older living in urban areas in six cities using a two-stage geographical cluster sampling method stratified by age and sex. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies will be determined using a sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. In addition, questionnaires will cover sociodemographic information, episodes of diseases and history of testing and treatment for COVID-like symptoms, travel history and safety measures. We will estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of the respective populations.

Results will be disseminated through reports and presentations at the country level as well as peer-reviewed publications and international scientific conferences presentations.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in urban settings in three sub-Saharan African countries (SeroCoV): a study protocol for a household-based cross-sectional prevalence study using two-stage cluster sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has caused serious consequences on many aspects of social life throughout the world since the first case of pneumonia with unknown etiology was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province in China in December 2019. Note that the incubation period distribution is key to the prevention and control efforts of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the conditional distribution of the incubation period of COVID-19 given the age of infected cases and estimate its corresponding quantiles from the information of 2172 confirmed cases from 29 provinces outside Hubei in China. METHODS: We collected data on the infection dates, onset dates, and ages of the confirmed cases through February 16th, 2020. All the data were downloaded from the official websites of the health commission. As the epidemic was still ongoing at the time we collected data, the observations subject to biased sampling. To address this issue, we developed a new maximum likelihood method, which enables us to comprehensively study the effect of age on the incubation period. RESULTS: Based on the collected data, we found that the conditional quantiles of the incubation period distribution of COVID-19 vary by age. In detail, the high conditional quantiles of people in the middle age group are shorter than those of others while the low quantiles did not show the same differences. We estimated that the 0.95-th quantile related to people in the age group 23 55 is less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Observing that the conditional quantiles vary across age, we may take more precise measures for people of different ages. For example, we may consider carrying out an age-dependent quarantine duration in practice, rather than a uniform 14-days quarantine period. Remarkably, we may need to extend the current quarantine duration for people aged 0 22 and over 55 because the related 0.95-th quantiles are much greater than 14 days.

Hypothesized correlates with latent class cluster groups including quarantining, self-isolation, suicidal ideations, sitting hours per day, and physical activity (vigorous intensity exercise in minutes per week) were examined. The delimited participant sample consisted of 606 university young adults 18 to 25 years of age (M = 21.24  1.62). Latent cluster analysis (LCA) modeled patterns of depression and anxiety symptom severity and alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between group analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to examine relationships between latent class clusters and correlates including quarantining, self-isolation, suicidal ideations, sitting hours per day, and physical activity (vigorous intensity exercise in minutes per week).

METHODS: We conducted qualitative case studies consisting of semistructured, audio-recorded interviews with decision makers and center staff in 6 innovation centers. We also conducted nonparticipant observations of meetings and center tours, where we took field notes. Qualitative data were analyzed initially within and then across cases facilitated by QSR International's NVivo software. RESULTS: The centers had different institutional arrangements, including university-associated institutes or innovation laboratories, business accelerators or incubators, and academic health science partnership models. We conducted interviews with 34 individuals, 1 group interview with 3 participants, and observations of 4 meetings. Although the centers differed significantly in relation to their mission, structure, and governance, we observed key common characteristics. These included high-level leadership support and incentives to engage in innovation activities, a clear mission to address identified gaps within their respective organizational and health system settings, physical spaces that facilitated networking through open-door policies, flat managerial structures characterized by new organizational roles for which boundary spanning was key, and a wider innovation ecosystem that was strategically and proactively engaged with the center facilitating external partnerships.

All relevant evidences available till the time of submission of this article were briefly discussed. Once advised as blanket therapy for all patients, recent reports of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin indicated no potential benefit and use of such combination may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Clinical evidence with newer antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir is promising that can hasten the patient recovery and reduce the mortality. With steroids, evidence is much clear in that it should be used in low dose and for short period not extending beyond 7 days in moderate to severe hospitalized patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and dose should be based on the coagulation profile and risk of thromboembolism. Immunomodulatory drugs such tocilizumab may be considered for severe and critically ill patients to improve the outcomes. Though ulinastatin can be a potential alternative immunomodulator, there is lack of clinical evidence on its usage in COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy can be potentially lifesaving in critically ill patients. However, there is need to generate further evidence with various such therapies.

However, there is no comprehensive review of safety data reported from the vaccine trials, which is critical information to inform the policies in order to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the risk aversion perceived due to the COVID-vaccine side effects. This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the safety data from the published COVID-19 vaccine trials. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) for published studies between Dec 2019 and 2020. Eligible study designs were randomized trials and pre-and post-intervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results. From PubMed, Embase, WHO database, and Google Scholar screened titles and abstracts, 11 studies were identified in this review. Most of the reactions reported were mild to moderate whereas a few with severe intensity. All reactions resolved within 3C4 days. The commonly reported local adverse events were pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness. The systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Some trials also reported laboratory derangements like decreased hemoglobin, increased bilirubin, altered SGOT and SGPT. None of these alterations were clinically manifested and were self-limiting. Few clinical trials reported serious adverse events, but they were unrelated to vaccination. This systematic review indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be safe with no serious adverse events. However, long-term post-marketing surveillance data, particularly in high-risk vulnerable populations (elderly and those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children) is warranted to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Adverse Events Reported From COVID-19 Vaccine Trials: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A doen?a de coronavrus 2019 (COVID-19) foi relatada em quase todos os pases do mundo desde dezembro de 2019.

As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the American public continues to be inundated with messages reinforcing the importance of social distancing, hand-washing and the effectiveness of masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. While most citizens diligently responded to these recommendations with compliance, there remained subcultures of the American public determined to resist these recommendations and engage in a discourse rooted in a mistrust of science. This discourse of science mistrust was perpetuated through the use of social media, as well as the modeling behaviors of government leaders, particularly as social media posts and news coverage were primary methods of social interaction during mandated stay-at-home orders. The discourse of science mistrust perpetuated during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that a concerted effort is required by all science educators to aid with overcoming this discourse. Overcoming science mistrust begins in the science classroom by implementing pedagogical opportunities for science students to obtain, evaluate, and communicate scientific information. Allowing students to obtain and evaluate information are a critical skill to develop in the science classroom as science educators aim to produce competent consumers of scientific information. Furthermore, science students ought to also have experience with the skills associated with communicating scientific information. Communicating scientific information is a critical skill for science students to develop as it is through the effective communication of credible scientific information that the discourse of science mistrust can be overcome. Providing these learning opportunities to science students empower students to effectively evaluate social media and news coverage associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and promote a future, wherein citizens are able to read, interpret, and critically consume scientific information to overcome discourses of science mistrust.","output":"Overcoming the discourse of science mistrust: how science education can be used to develop competent consumers and communicators of science information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for new ways of thinking about data protection.

PURPOSE: In this study, the network pharmacology, molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR) were used to explore the potential compounds and interaction mechanism in the Toujie Quwen Granules (TQG) for the treatment of coronavirus pneumonia 2019. STUDY DESIGN: The chemical constituents and compound targets of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Pseudostellariae Radix, Artemisia Annua L, Peucedani Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Scutellariae Radix, Hedysarum Multijugum Maxim, Isatidis Folium, Radix Bupleuri, Fritiliariae Irrhosae Bulbus, Cicadae Periostracum, Poria Cocos Wolf, Pseudobulbus Cremastrae Seu Pleiones, Mume Fructus, Figwort Root and Fritillariae Thunbrgii Bulbus in TQG were searched. The target name was translated to gene name using the UniProt database and then the Chinese medicine-compound-target network was constructed. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI), Gene ontology (GO) function enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the core targets were performed in the Metascape to predict its mechanism. The top 34 compounds in the Chinese medicine-compound-target network were docked with SARS-CoV-2 3CL enzyme and SARS--CoV--2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and then the 13 compounds with lowest affinity score were docked with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and interleukin 6 to explore its interaction mechanism. Lastly, SPR experiments were done using the quercetin, astragaloside IV, rutin and isoquercitrin, which were screened from the Chinese medicine-compound-target network and molecular docking. RESULTS: The Chinese medicine-compound-target network includes 16 medicinal materials, 111 compounds and 298 targets, in which the degree of PTGS2, TNF and IL-6 is higher compared with other targets and which are the disease target exactly. The result of GO function enrichment analysis included the response to the molecule of bacterial origin, positive regulation of cell death, apoptotic signaling pathway, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, cytokine receptor binding and so on. KEGG pathway analysis enrichment revealed two pathways: signaling pathway- IL-17 and signaling pathway- TNF. The result of molecular docking showed that the affinity score of compounds including quercetin, isoquercitrin, astragaloside IV and rutin is higher than other compounds. In addition, the SPR experiments revealed that the quercetin and isoquercitrin were combined with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein rather than Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, while astragaloside IV and rutin were combined with ACE2 rather than SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

The COVID-19 represents a global concern of public health caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in which there is not actually any specific therapy. MSCs exert an immunomodulation effect due to the secretion of endogenous factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)- and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11. Recent reports are promising for further studies and clinical applications of ADSCs and Ad-MSCs in COVID-19 patients.

Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 replication. Utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) airCliquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory tissue incubated at 40C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry but refractory to viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of viral RNA replication and apical shedding of infectious virus. We identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the differential regulation of epithelial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that impact upon multiple pathways, including intracellular immune regulation, without disruption to general transcription or epithelium integrity.

We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5.

Inflammatory response, the difference between post-stress and resting values, was examined as a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using subdistribution hazards models for competing risks adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medications. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure. All biomarkers were standardized. The mean age was 63 years (range 34-79) and 24% were women. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 71 patients experienced MACE. Overall, there was no significant association between inflammatory response to stress and risk of MACE, but there were sex-based interactions for IL-6 (p = 0.001) and MCP-1 (p = 0.008).

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect acutely ill patients with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. OBJECTIVE: To inform these efforts, this paper provides an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with nurses (n=5) and attending (n=5) and resident (n=15) physicians on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine. Semi-structured interview protocols and qualitative analysis were framed around the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identified key themes using a rapid analytic process and consensus approach. RESULTS: All clinical team members reported wide reach of inpatient telemedicine, with some use for almost all COVID-19 patients. Inpatient telemedicine was perceived to be effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and personal protective equipment (PPE) use without significantly compromising quality of care. Physician workflows remained relatively stable as most standard clinical activities were conducted via telemedicine following the initial intake examination, though resident physicians reported reduced educational opportunities given limited opportunities to conduct physical exams. Nurse workflows required significant adaptations to cover non-nursing duties such as food delivery and facilitating technology connections for patients and physicians alike. Perceived patient impact included consistent care quality, with some considerations around privacy. Reported challenges included: patient-clinical team communication and personal connection with the patient, perceptions of patient isolation, ongoing technical challenges, and certain aspects of the physical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical team members reported inpatient telemedicine encounters as acceptable and effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and PPE use. Nurses adapted their workflows more than physicians to implement the new technology and bore a higher burden of in-person care and technical support. Recommendations for improved inpatient telemedicine use include information technology (IT) support and training, increased technical functionality, and remote access for the clinical team.","output":"Inpatient telemedicine implementation as an infection control response to COVID-19: A qualitative process evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently a global pandemic.

Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and immune response such as NF-B signal transduction. Interestingly, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins.

The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2.

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: Mental disorders were assessed using the \\"Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\\" and social support was determined using the \\"Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.\\" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health.

Through these experiments, we demonstrated that the quality of water filtrated by the polyurethane modified materials met the requirements of the 'National Comprehensive Wastewater Discharge Standards', and the filtration efficiency for suspended particles and oils in oily sewage was higher than 80%. These materials have important practical significance for the harmless treatment of oily sewage.","output":"Experimental study on filtration effect of oilfield sewage based on new polyurethane modified materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The results have been inconsistent with regards to the impact of uric acid (UA) on clinical outcomes both in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to study the influence of serum UA levels on mortality in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Data on 492 patients from a single peritoneal dialysis unit were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 53.5  15.3 years, with 52% being female (n = 255). The concomitant comorbidities at the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) encompassed diabetes mellitus (n = 179, 34.6%), hypertension (n = 419, 85.2%), and cardiovascular disease (n = 186, 37.9%). The study cohort was divided into sex-specific tertiles according to baseline UA level. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality with adjustments for demographic and laboratory data, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using UA tertile 1 as the reference, the adjusted HR of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for tertile 3 was 0.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24C0.68, p = 0.001), 0.4 (95% CI 0.2C0.81, p = 0.01), and 0.47 (95% CI 0.19C1.08, p = 0.1). In the fully adjusted model, the adjusted HRs of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for each 1-mg/dL increase in UA level were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69C0.9, p = 0.07), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61C1.01, p = 0.06), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.48C1.21, p = 0.32) for men and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44C0.73, p < 0.001), 0.6 (95% CI, 0.41C0.87, p = 0.006), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26C0.6, p < 0.001) for women, respectively.

During the pandemic, people were also reminded that, throughout history, people have been subjected to immense suffering. The First World War (1914--1918) ended just over a hundred years ago. In this devastating war that \\"had to prevent all further wars\\", 22 million people died. In the year it ended, the Spanish Flu broke out and another 50 million people died. Perspectives on past events that adversely affected the lives of people might help people to interpret their own situation and see the present in a different perspective. One could ask: what sustains people in difficult times? What gives them courage? What gives them resilience and helps them through lockdowns? In this article, it is argued that faith, lived religion and rituals can give people new perspectives and that hymns, that is, songs of faith, play a significant role. A hymn of German origin, Wer nur den lieben Gott l?sst walten, is presented as an example. The background to the origin of the text is given, whereafter the original German text and the Afrikaans translation, as well as the revised versions of the translation, are discussed critically. A futher discussion of the reception history of the hymn follows, showing its use during war and in two films, and how it could function as an illustration of lived religion. The writer of the hymn text, Georg Neumark (1621--1681), was born during a devastating war in Germany that lasted thirty years. In his early twenties, he travelled to K?nigsberg to study law, but was robbed of all his earthly possessions by highway robbers mugging the mail coach. He interpreted his difficult existential circumstances from the perspective of lived religion and wrote a hymn of comfort, a \\"Trostlied\\", Wer nur den lieben Gott l?sst walten, encouraging himself and others by saying that one should let God be in control of one's life and that one could trust God. The text contains striking alliteration and assonance that lend a poetic quality to it. It is accompanied by a touching melody that Neumark composed for the text -- the only melody written by Neumark that is known. The text with seven stanzas was first published in Neumark's song collection Fortgepflanzter Musikalisch-Poetischer Lustwald (Jena, 1657) and has been translated into several languages. The English translation entitled If thou but suffer God to guide thee was done by Catherine Winkworth (1855, 1863). In 1931, GBA Gerdener translated it into Afrikaans. Six of the seven stanzas were retained in the first offficial hymnal in Afrikaans, Psalm- en Gesangboek (1944). The text was amended and drastically shortened to three stanzas for the second official hymnal, the Psalm- en Gesangboek (1978). More radical changes were made for the version published in the third and current official hymnal, Liedboek van die Kerk (2001). The original Afrikaans translation relied heavily on a Dutch translation by Abraham Rutgers (Liedboek voor de Kerken 1994:429). It reflected certain problems in the Dutch translation, but stayed true to the original German text. When the Afrikaans text was revised at various stages, however, the original German text and the texts on which the original was based, were not considered sufficiently. Significant features of the original text thus got lost, especially in the latest version in Afrikaans. It is argued, however, that certain aspects of the current text, coupled with aspects of the old text in Afrikaans that are still alive in the hymnic memory of people, and carried by the very fitting melody, could still sustain people in difficult times. The reception history of the hymn in contexts where the original text plays a strong role and also where translations close to the original are used, shows its use on various levels as part of the lived faith or lived religion of people. Besides being a source of comfort to civilian Germans during World War 1, the German version was also used for militaristic and patriotic purpos s uring the war. It plays a prominent role in two films -- Babette's Feast (1987), a Danish film, and Vaya con Dios (2002), a German film. The films illustrate that God's voice can be heard in songs of faith and that this hymn can open up broader perspectives, and give people a voice in difficult circumstances. In the films, the hymn expresses gratitude, love, community and trust. The hymn can remind people that God is present in dark days and in suffering and can give hope. It can remind people of God's love and indicate the path they need to follow. The performative power unleashed when singing the hymn, can transform people. It is argued that when the hymn is sung, space can open up and people be freed from their confinement, their lockdown and their shelters. They can sing, pray and follow God's way -- and in doing so, also comfort and support others.

Public Health England (PHE) provided guidance to manage the spread of the virus. In response to the national lockdown, the Forensic Healthcare Service part of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) took measures that were considered necessary to prevent the risk of spread to patients and staff.Restrictions necessary to contain the virus included immediate suspension of all patients leave except emergency leave, suspension of visits by family members and professionals including legal visits and restrictions on multidisciplinary (MDT) members physically present on the wards. It was necessary to adapt our existing model of care to reflect and represent the challenges faced by such restrictions.A service evaluation project was undertaken to ascertain the patients' and carers perspectives of the management of restrictions.MethodStandardsIt is noteworthy that no service standards in the context of this unique global pandemic were available internationally, nationally or regionally at the time of undertaking the project.Methodology / Data collectionAn anonymous patient feedback questionnaire was developed to collect data on voluntary basis from all the inpatients within the secure and forensic CDS. Patients' feedback was broadly divided in to three sections 1) personal factors, 2) satisfaction with access to information and 3) satisfaction with services to include mental and physical well-being.Patients' feedback was collected during a 6-week period. For observation purposes, risk comparison anonymous data were also collected. Informal Carers' feedback was collected with regard to virtual visits.ResultDuring the data collection period 99 out of 105 beds were occupied. The response rate was 49% (49 responders).Overall 73% of responders expressed that their mental health was affected. Approximately 51% of responders expressed that progress towards their discharge was very much affected. 91% of responders were not coping well with the new circumstancesOverall, carers' feedback was positive in regard to provision of virtual visits.ConclusionOur survey has shown that the necessary COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have in some domains resulted in a negative impact on patients mental wellbeing and progression. However, it also identifies positive areas of new practice, which have been maintained by the service.","output":"Coping with and management of COVID-19 restrictions within the secure and forensic inpatient setting - a patients' and carers perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the stressors and coping strategies of medical laboratory technologists (MLTs) and assistants (MLAs) working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In this descriptive qualitative study, we held two focus groups with MLTs and MLA who were working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus group sessions were transcribed verbatim followed by thematic analysis to develop codes and themes. FINDINGS: A total of 13 participants across Ontario were involved in our study, which included one MLT (n = 7) group and one MLA (n = 6) MLA. Overall, the stressors and coping methods identified between both focus groups were consistent. Our results revealed four main themes: (1) COVID-19 contributing to the notable and existing staff shortage; (2) the pandemic reinforced that medical laboratory employees are forgotten within the healthcare system; (3) a poor work environment exacerbated by the pandemic; and (4) a resilient and passionate group. Rich descriptions explained the underlying issues related to the themes. CONCLUSIONS: MLTs and MLAs are critical members of the healthcare team and provide vital patient care services.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen patients with DM2 were questioned about respiratory symptoms. They underwent PSG with morning arterial gas analyses (AGA). Respiratory functions and phrenic CMAPs were studied. The data were compared to those of 16 healthy controls and 25 patients with DM1. RESULTS Daytime tiredness is the most common symptom, but orthopnea was reported in 13% of patients with DM2. A detailed sleep architecture analysis revealed a significantly greater proportion of time in stage 3 and REM sleep, and a shorter time in stage 2 in the DM2 than in controls. Lower respiratory volumes and pressures, abnormalities in AGA, night oxygen desaturation and higher EtCO2 are present in DM2, but are less pronounced than in the DM1 population. Small CMAP amplitudes were presented in 12% of patients with DM2, correlating with smaller respiratory functions and poorer sleep quality. AHI was abnormal in 38% of DM2, mainly due to obstructive apneas. PSG did not reveal hypoventilation. CONCLUSIONS Diaphragm weakness and sleep apneas might be present in patients with DM2; therefore, we suggest regular questioning about symptoms of respiratory insufficiency and monitoring of phrenic CMAP. PSG should be recorded, when patients have suggestive symptoms, abnormalities in AGA or higher BMI.","output":"Sleep and breathing disorders in myotonic dystrophy type 2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ontario, within the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the number of non-commercial poultry flocks (referred to as \\"small flocks\\"). Small poultry flocks may act as a reservoir of avian and zoonotic pathogens, given the flocks' limited access to veterinary services, inadequate biosecurity practices, and increased risk of contact with wild birds. Despite these potential risks, there is a scarcity of data concerning the prevalence of poultry and zoonotic pathogens among these flocks. To assess the baseline prevalence of bacterial and viral infectious pathogens, prospective surveillance of small flock postmortem submissions to the Animal Health Laboratory was conducted over a 2-y period. With the owner's consent, a postmortem examination and pre-set tests for infectious agents were conducted. A total of 160 submissions, mainly chickens (84%), were received. Among bacterial pathogens, Brachyspira spp., Mycoplasma synoviae, Campylobacter spp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and Salmonella spp. were detected in 37%, 36%, 35%, 23%, and 3% of tested submissions, respectively. Among viral pathogens, infectious bronchitis virus, fowl adenovirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, avian reovirus, and infectious bursal disease virus were detected in 39%, 35%, 15%, 4%, and 1% of submissions, respectively.

We find that both empirical expectations (what others do) and normative expectations (what others approve of) play a significant role in compliance, beyond the effect of any other individual or group characteristic. In our vignette experiment, respondents evaluate the likelihood of compliance with social distancing and staying at home of someone similar to them in a hypothetical scenario.

Similar results are obtained when looking at self-reported compliance among those with high expectations. Our results are moderated by individuals trust in government and trust in science. Holding expectations high, the effect of trusting science is substantial and significant in our vignette experiment (22% increase in compliance likelihood), and even larger in self-reported compliance (76% and 127% increase before and after the lockdown). By contrast, trusting the government only generates modest effects.

This acute elevation in glucose after injury or illness is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including multiple organ failure. Stress-induced hyperglycemia is often attributed to insulin resistance as controlling glucose levels via exogenous insulin improves outcomes, but the mechanisms are unclear. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are direct targets of insulin signaling in the liver that regulate glucose homeostasis via direct and indirect pathways. Loss of hepatic FOXO transcription factors reduces hyperglycemia in chronic insulin resistance; however, the role of FOXOs in stress-induced hyperglycemia is unknown. METHODS: We subjected mice lacking FOXO transcription factors in the liver to a model of injury known to cause stress-induced hyperglycemia. Glucose, insulin, glycerol, fatty acids, cytokines, and adipokines were assessed before and after injury. Liver and adipose tissue were analyzed for changes in glycogen, FOXO target gene expression, and insulin signaling. RESULTS: Stress-induced hyperglycemia was associated with reduced hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic FOXO target gene expression while loss of FOXO1, 3, and 4 in the liver attenuated hyperglycemia and prevented hyperinsulinemia. Mechanistically, the loss of FOXO transcription factors mitigated the stress-induced hyperglycemia response by directly altering gene expression and glycogenolysis in the liver and indirectly suppressing lipolysis in adipose tissue. Reductions were associated with decreased IL-6, TNF-, and follistatin and increased FGF21, suggesting that cytokines and FOXO-regulated hepatokines contribute to the stress-induced hyperglycemia response. CONCLUSIONS: This study implicates FOXO transcription factors as a predominant driver of stress-induced hyperglycemia through means that include cross-talk between the liver and adipose, highlighting a novel mechanism underlying acute hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in stress.","output":"Loss of FOXO transcription factors in the liver mitigates stress-induced hyperglycemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent evidence implicates A1 beta-casein consumption in mechanisms that are of potential importance to mental health, yet its possible effects on psychological endpoints remains unknown. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the comparative effects of consumption of dairy products containing A2 beta-casein versus conventional dairy (i.e. containing both A1 and A2 beta-casein) on symptoms of psychological distress in women with low mood. METHODS: The MooD Study is a 16-week, superiority, 1:1 parallel group, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Ninety women with low mood (Patient Health Questionnaire score  5) will be randomised to consume either A2 beta-casein only or conventional dairy products. The primary outcome, symptoms of psychological distress, will be measured by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes will include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, severity of low mood, cognition, gut microbiota composition, gut symptomatology, markers of immune function, gut inflammation, systemic metabolites, endothelial integrity and oxidative stress, body composition, perceived wellbeing, sleep, quality of life, resource use and cost-effectiveness.

Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future.

For fine particulate matter filtration, the use of a face mask filter is efficient; however, its use is accompanied by a high-pressure drop, making breathing difficult. Electrostatic interactions in the filter of the face mask constitute the dominant filtration mechanism for capturing fine particulate matter; these masks are, however, significantly weakened by the high humidity in exhaled breath. In this study, we demonstrate that a filter with an electrostatically rechargeable structure operates with normal breathing air power. In our novel face mask, a filter membrane is assembled by layer-by-layer stacking of the electrospun PVDF nanofiber mat formed on a nylon mesh. Tribo/piezoelectric characteristics via multilayer structure enhance filtration performance, even under air-powered filter bending taken as a normal breathing condition.

Family longitudinal cohort studies collect in-depth data that can capture the influence of an era on family lifestyle, mental health, chronic disease, education and financial stability to enable identification of gaps in society and provide the evidence for changes in government in policy and practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Queensland Family Cohort (QFC) is a prospective, observational, longitudinal study that will recruit 12 500 pregnant families across the state of Queensland (QLD), Australia and intends to follow-up families and children for three decades. To identify the immediate and future health requirements of the QLD population; pregnant participants and their partners will be enrolled by 24 weeks of gestation and followed up at 24, 28 and 36 weeks of gestation, during delivery, on-ward, 6 weeks postpartum and then every 12 months where questionnaires, biological samples and physical measures will be collected from parents and children. To examine the impact of environmental exposures on families, data related to environmental pollution, household pollution and employment exposures will be linked to pregnancy and health outcomes. Where feasible, data linkage of state and federal government databases will be used to follow the participants long term. Biological samples will be stored long term for future discoveries of biomarkers of health and disease. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Mater Research Ethics (HREC/16/MHS/113). Findings will be reported to (1) QFC participating families; (2) funding bodies, institutes and hospitals supporting the QFC; (3) federal, state and local governments to inform policy; (4) presented at local, national and international conferences and (5) disseminated by peer-review publications.","output":"Queensland Family Cohort: a study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 vaccine is a scientific breakthrough to end the pandemic.

METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochran Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for the relevant records up to April 2021. Moreover, we scanned MedRxiv, Google Scholar, and clinical registry databases to identify additional records. We have used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias tools to assess the quality of studies. This Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software (version 5.3). RESULTS Fourteen studies were included. No significant difference was observed between lopinavir/ritonavir and non-antiviral treatment groups in terms of negative rate of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on day 7 (risk ratio [RR]: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.09; P=0.17), and day 14 (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.05; P=0.25), PCR negative conversion time (mean difference [MD]: 1.09; 95% CI: -0.10 to 2.29; P=0.07), secondary outcomes, and adverse events (P>0.05).

To limit the potential for damage related to mucosal pressure injuries from the presence of an endotracheal tube, the cuff should be placed below the cricoid in children. Previously, no clinical or imaging method has been used in real-time to determine the exact location of the endotracheal tube cuff after endotracheal intubation. Point-of-care ultrasound may provide an option as a safe and rapid means of visualizing the endotracheal tube cuff and its relationship to the cricoid ring thereby achieving ideal endotracheal tube cuff positioning - below the cricoid. METHODS In this prospective, non-randomized trial, point-of-care ultrasound was used following endotracheal intubation in children to evaluate the position of the endotracheal tube cuff in relationship to the cricoid and tracheal rings. After anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated, the endotracheal tube cuff and its position in relation to the cricoid and tracheal rings were identified in the longitudinal plane using point-of-care ultrasound. With the patient's neck in a neutral position, the level of the proximal (cephalad) margin of the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube was identified and recorded in relationship to the cricoid and tracheal rings. The ideal position is defined as the cephalad margin of the endotracheal tube cuff below the level of the cricoid. RESULTS The study cohort included 80 patients, ranging in age from 1 to 78 months. In all patients, the cuff of the ETT, cricoid, and tracheal rings were identified. The cephalad end of the endotracheal tube cuff was found at the level of the cricoid in 16.3% of patients, at the first tracheal ring in 27.5% of patients, at the second tracheal ring in 23.8% of patients, at the third tracheal ring in 17.5% of patients, at and below the fourth tracheal ring in 15% of patients. Initial endotracheal tube cuff position had no significant association with age, height, weight, endotracheal tube size, and endotracheal tube type. CONCLUSION Point-of-care ultrasound provides a rapid and effective means of identifying the position of the endotracheal tube cuff in relationship to the cricoid ring. The technique may have applications in the perioperative arena, emergency departments, and intensive care units.","output":"Point of care ultrasound to confirm endotracheal tube cuff position in relationship to the cricoid in the pediatric population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains an important, yet challenging diagnosis for physicians.

With written home exercise programs being the commonly prescribed form of rehabilitation after discharge, mobile health technology coupled with task-oriented programs can enhance self-management of upper extremity training. In the current study, a rehabilitation system, namely mRehab, was designed that included a smartphone app and 3D-printed household items such as mug, bowl, key, and doorknob embedded with a smartphone. The app interface allowed the user to select rehabilitation activities and receive feedback on the number of activity repetitions completed, time to complete each activity, and quality of movement. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usability, perceived usefulness, and acceptance of the mRehab system by individuals with stroke and identify the challenges experienced by them when using the system remotely in a home-based setting. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used with 11 individuals with chronic stroke. Following training, individuals with stroke used the mRehab system for 6 weeks at home. Each participant completed surveys and engaged in a semistructured interview. Participants qualitative reports regarding the usability of mRehab were integrated with their survey reports and quantitative performance data. RESULTS: Of the 11 participants, 10 rated the mRehab system between the 67.5th and 97.5th percentile on the System Usability Scale, indicating their satisfaction with the usability of the system. Participants also provided high ratings of perceived usefulness (mean 5.8, SD 0.9) and perceived ease of use (mean 5.3, SD 1.5) on a 7-point scale based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Common themes reported by participants showed a positive response to mRehab with some suggestions for improvements. Participants reported an interest in activities they perceived to be adequately challenging. Some participants indicated a need for customizing the feedback to be more interpretable. Overall, most participants indicated that they would like to continue using the mRehab system at home. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing usability in the lived environment over a prolonged duration of time is essential to identify the match between the system and users needs and preferences. While mRehab was well accepted, further customization is desired for a better fit with the end users.

Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes.

CO$_2$-free electricity can be generated in these plants by retrofitting them for iron combustion. Iron oxides produced during the process can be collected and reduced back to metallic iron using H$_2$, in a circular process where it becomes an energy carrier. Using clean energy in the recycling process enables storage and distribution of excess generated in periods of abundance. This concept uses and scales up existing dry metal cycle technologies, which are the focus of extensive research worldwide. Retrofitting is evaluated here to determine feasibility of adding these material requirements to markets, in the context of current plans for decarbonization of steel industry, and policies on hydrogen and renewable electricity. Results indicate that not only for a single power plant, but also on larger scales, the retrofitting plan is viable, promoting and supporting advancements in sustainable electricity, steel industry and hydrogen production, converging necessary technological and construction efforts. The maturation and first commercial-scale application of iron combustion technology by 2030, together with developing necessary reduction infrastructure over the next decades, would pave the way for large-scale retrofitting and support the phasing out of coal in many regions. The proposed plan represents a feasible solution that takes advantage of existing assets, creates a long-lasting legacy for the industry and establishes circular energy economies that increase local energy security.","output":"Iron as a sustainable chemical carrier of renewable energy: Analysis of opportunities and challenges for retrofitting coal-fired power plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental ill-health prolongs and complicates other chronic illnesses, which is a major public health concern because of the potential stress it places on health systems. Prevention via active aging and place-based interventions thus became increasingly important with population aging, e.g., through health promotion and age-friendly neighborhoods. However, how the targeted outcomes of these efforts are related remains unclear. This paper examined whether the relationship between active living and mental health or health-related quality of life is mediated by neighborhood cohesion. Cross-sectional data were drawn from n = 270 community-dwelling adults aged 50 and above in the Gerontology Research ProgramCenter for Ageing Research in the Environment (GRP-CARE) Survey. Path analysis showed that one can live actively for better mental health (B(total) = 0.24), but it is largely mediated by neighborhood cohesion (37%). Further examination of the factors of neighborhood cohesion showed that this mediation is explained by communal affordance (B(indirect) = 0.05) and neighborhood friendship (B(indirect) = 0.05). Additional study of the association between these mediators and factors of mental health revealed two psychosocial processes: (1) better community spaces (e.g., greenery and third places) support communal living (B = 0.36) and help older adults obtain emotional support (B = 0.32) for greater autonomy (B = 0.25); (2) spending more time outdoors enhances neighborhood friendship (B = 0.33) and interpersonal skills (B = 0.37), which in turn improves coping (B = 0.39). In short, the effects of active living on health are limited by ones neighborhood environment. Neighborhood cohesion must be considered or it may stifle individual and policy efforts to age actively and healthily in urban environments. Context-sensitive implementations are required.","output":"Neighborhood Makes or Breaks Active Ageing?

Objectives: We determined the risk factors that increase the risk of death in patients with Parkinson's disease who are infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of PD admitted to Montefiore Hospital (Bronx, New York) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Retrospective review of electronic medical records confirmed the diagnosis; patients were classified by severity of PD. PD severity, demographic, socioeconomic factors, and co-morbidities were correlated with mortality rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We identified 162 patients meeting criteria; chart review confirmed a diagnosis of PD in 70 patients. Of the 70 patients, 53 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 were negative. PD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality rate (35.8%) compared to PD patients without the infection (5.9%, P = 0.028). PD patients older than 70 years of age, those with advanced Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and non-Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African- Americans) had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected. Conclusions: PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection when age was controlled. However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and age greater than 70 years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality.

The present study aimed to investigate the psychological outcomes and associated factors among vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. METHODS: From March to August 2021, an online nationwide survey was conducted with a total of 2,038 Bangladeshi HCWs. The frequency of symptoms of general health problems, depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, and loneliness was assessed using the Bangla versions of the GHQ-12, PHQ-2, GAD-2, PSS-4, PC-PTSD-5, ISI, and UCLA-LS scales, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with unvaccinated HCWs (n = 1,058), vaccinated HCWs (n = 980) had a statistically significant lower prevalence of general health problems (16.7 vs. 59.1%), depression (15.6 vs. 31.9%), post-traumatic stress disorder (22.3 vs. 30.8%), insomnia (23.8 vs. 64.9%), and loneliness symptoms (13.9 vs. 21.8%).

Ideally, use of ciprofloxacin would be prefaced with AR determination to avoid overuse or misuse of the antibiotic.

A total of 40 patients were included, 24 of which were pure N(2)O users. Limb weakness and numbness accounted for the majority of chief complaints. Neurologic symptoms were the most common clinical manifestations (90%). A more severe ED triage level, faster heart rate, greater agitation, and cardiovascular symptoms were significantly noted in combined illicit drug users. In ED, limb numbness/weakness should arouse physicians awareness of patients using N(2)O. Combined use of N(2)O and illicit drugs can cause great harm to health.","output":"The Clinical Presentations of Nitrous Oxide Users in an Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemics, the involvement of patients nervous system with this virus is increasingly reporting.

A number of clinical trials are underway to investigate candidate products, most of them are repurposed products. As new evidenced emerges, WHO updates its recommendations on clinical management to support Member States amending their treatment protocols. Hydroxychloroquine / Chloroquine (HCQ/CQ) and Lopinavir + Ritonavir arms of the Solidarity Trial were discontinued. There is strong recommendation against administrating these products to COVID-19 patients. In contrary, Corticosteroids were identified as lifesaving medicines, substantially reducing mortality for critically ill patients. This study aimed at checking the alignment of countries COVID-19 treatment protocols in the WHO African region with the WHO recommendations, and analyze their impact on supply chain and quality of care. Methods: : In October-November 2020, country treatment protocols were collected, and data on therapeutics were summarized in an Excel Sheet to facilitate their comparison with the WHO recommendations. Results: : From the thirty protocols collected, 50% were recommending HCQ/CQ for mild COVID-19. The proportion was quite similar for moderate and severe cases accounting 57% and 53 % of protocols respectively, while 27% were still recommending HCQ/CQ for critically ill patients. Antibiotics were recommended in 53% and 80 % of protocols for mild and moderate cases respectively. Only 47 % and 60% of protocols were recommending corticosteroids for severe and critical cases respectively. Convalescent Plasma was reflected in few protocols. Discussion: HCQ and CQ were the standard treatment of COVID-19 in most of countries, diverting resources from the supply chain for essential services. There is a serious risk of antibiotic misuse, which can potentially lead to antimicrobial resistance surge, the increased rates of morbidity, mortality, treatment costs and financial burden for patients and communities. Slow uptake of corticosteroids may compromise the quality of care for severe and critical cases. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that, in cases similar to COVID-19 without efficacious treatment, treatment protocols are handled as living documents to be timely amended. Proactive update of country protocols to reflect evolving scientific evidences is critical, to ensure that all patients benefit from high standard quality of care.","output":"COVID-19 Treatment Protocols in the WHO African Region - Results of a Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The risk factors associated to long-term survival were assessed in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma undergoing ablative therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS Single-centre cohort study, retrospectively analysed and prospectively collected consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic liver disease of colorectal carcinoma treated with ablative therapies between 1996 and 2013. Factors associated with survival time were identified using Cox's proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates. A forward variable selection based on Akaike information criterion was performed. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals for each factor were calculated. Statistical significance was set as P<.05. RESULTS Seventy-five patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, with a mean age of 65.6 (10.3) underwent 106 treatments. Variables selected were good quality of life (RR 0.308, 95% CI 0.150-0.632) and tumour extension (RR 3.070, 95% CI 1.776-5.308). The median overall survival was 18.5 months (95% CI 17.4-24.4).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on new CIED implantations for 2017-20 were prospectively collected by nine hospitals in Catalonia. A mixed model with random intercepts corrected for time was used to estimate the change in monthly CIED implantations. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, an absolute decrease of 56.5% was observed (54.7% in PM and 63.7% in ICD) in CIED implantation rates. Total CIED implantations for 2017-19 and January and February 2020 was 250/month (>195 PM and >55 ICD), decreasing to 207 (161 PM and 46 ICD) in March and 131 (108 PM and 23 ICD) in April 2020.

Within a very short period the infection spread across the whole world, but there was no previous medical history about this virus and how, where, and when the disease infected the human body and mutated in humans is still unknown. Subsequently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as the world pandemic on March 2020 by the World Health Organization because of its harmfulness and super spreading nature. Till now, there is no specific medications and clinical treatment available to avoid this pandemic COVID-19 outbreak. For this, it is essential to have a detailed study and analysis through the recent technologies. The recent trends such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) based models can learn from past patient medication data and can suggest improvement accordingly by analyzing the data to control the spread. In the present scenario, the correct decision could be the appropriate precaution to stop spreading as well as controlling such a pandemic disease by proposing predictive ML that analyzes past data and conclude some useful information for future control of the spread of COVID-19 infections using minimum resources. The ML-based approach can be helpful to design different models to give a predictive solution for controlling infection and spreading and taking precaution toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In this chapter, we study the basic information of COVID-19 and its effectiveness worldwide. We also state the fundamental steps of ML, discuss the ML mechanism to study the pandemic for research and academic purposes, and study the data analytics of clinical data of India through a case study.

Methods: Epidemiological data from the HHS Protect Public Data Hub was analyzed to show trends in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-infection-related hospitalizations in the United States in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza strain data from NCBI Virus and FluView. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed all cases of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 across the Mayo Clinic Enterprise from January 2020 to January 2022 and identified cases of influenza co-infections within two weeks of PCR-positive diagnosis date. Using a cohort from the Mayo Clinic with joint PCR testing data, we estimated the expected number of co-infection cases given the background prevalences of COVID-19 and influenza during the Wuhan (Original), Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves of the pandemic. Findings: Considering data from all states of the United States using HHS Protect Public Data Hub, hospitalizations due to influenza co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 were seen to be highest in January 2022 compared to all previous months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 171,639 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases analyzed at Mayo Clinic between January 2020 and January 2022, only 73 cases of influenza co-infection were observed. Identified coinfected patients were relatively young (mean age: 28.4 years), predominantly male, and had few comorbidities. During the Delta era (June 16, 2021 to December 13, 2021), there were 9 lab-confirmed co-infection cases observed compared to 13.9 expected cases (95% CI: [12.7, 15.2]), and during the Omicron era (December 14, 2021 to January 17, 2022), there were 54 lab-confirmed co-infection cases compared to 80.9 expected cases (95% CI: [76.6, 85.1]). Conclusions: Reported co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are rare. These co-infections have occurred throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and their prevalence can be explained by background rates of COVID-19 and influenza infection. Preliminary assessment of longitudinal EHR data suggests that most co-infections so far have been observed among relatively young and healthy patients. Further analysis is needed to assess the outcomes of \\"flurona\\" among subpopulations with risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as older age, obesity, and immunocompromised status. Significance Statement: Reports of COVID-19 and influenza co-infections (\\"flurona\\") have raised concern in recent months as both COVID-19 and influenza cases have increased to significant levels in the US. Here, we analyze trends in co-infection cases over the course of the pandemic to show that these co-infection cases are expected given the background prevalences of COVID-19 and influenza independently. In addition, from an initial analysis of these co-infection cases which have been observed at the Mayo Clinic, we find that these co-infection cases are extremely rare and have mostly been observed in relatively young, healthy patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-infection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic: An assessment of co-infection rates and cohort characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to understand the concept of local wisdom (Indonesian term: kearifan local) from the perspective of Indonesian indigenous peoples (Indonesian term: masyarakat adat) in handling COVID-19 and environmental management policies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the time of viral RNA clearance in swab and serum samples of COVID-19 patients who received different medications. We also evaluated different factors that may be affected viral RNA persistence in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In March 2020, twenty-one hospitalized COVID-19 patients were participated in this prospective study. All patients received antiviral agents in their routine care. Throat swabs and blood samples were obtained from all patients in different intervals including day 3 or 5, day 7, day 10 and finally 14 days after the first positive real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCT) test Results: The median time from the SO to first negative rRT-PCR results for throat swabs and serum samples of COVID-19 patients were 18 and 14 days, respectively.

Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly designed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items.

Methods: This report aims to describe the conception and development of an intervention to prevent HCV reinfection and present preliminary results from its pilot testing at an opioid treatment program offering on-site primary medical care, including treatment for HCV infection. We developed a two-session intervention combining a teachable moment followed by a session based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model to reinforce learning. The teachable moment occurs in less than ten minutes during the routine blood draw to measure viral load during HCV treatment. The reinforcing IMB session builds knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy in practicing safer injection skills. Formative exploratory work for the intervention involved a literature review, planning meetings with implementation staff, and development of study materials. Intervention staff were trained and the intervention was pilot tested. Measured outcomes included feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to patients and implementers, study recruitment and retention, and preliminary changes in knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and HCV reinfection risk behaviors over the study time period.

Baseline data revealed gaps in HCV prevention knowledge that could lead to reinfection. We also report lessons learned related to implementation of such an intervention with this population in integrated care settings. After some minor adjustments, we found high levels of feasibility and acceptability for the intervention at the implementing organization. Intervention implementation was interrupted due to COVID-19 restrictions. Conclusions: It is possible to implement an intervention in an opioid treatment program to improve HCV prevention knowledge with the potential to prevent reinfection. Intervention staff must be attentive to participant needs regarding time and monetary constraints to maximize acceptability. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, future research should explore the possibility of offering the intervention via phone or video chat.","output":"Development and Pilot-testing of a Hepatitis C Reinfection Prevention Intervention for Patients in Treatment for Hepatitis C Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can have harmful effects on human health and can act as a precursor for the formation of other air pollutants in urban environment such as secondary PM2.5 and ozone. The lockdown measures for CoViD-19 allowed to simulate on a large scale the massive and prolonged reduction of road traffic (the main source for NO2 in urban environment). This work aims to selectively assess the maximum impact that total traffic blocking measures can have on NO2. For this reason, three megacities (London, Milan and Paris) were chosen that had similar characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, population, policies of urban traffic management and lockdown measures. 52 air quality control units have been used to compare data measured in lockdown and in the same periods of previous years, highlighting a significant decrease in NO2 concentration due to traffic (London: 71.1 % - 80.8 %; Milan: 8.6 % - 42.4%; Paris: 65.7 % - 79.8 %). In 2020 the contribution of traffic in London, Milan and Paris was dropped to 3.3  1.3 g m-3, 6.1  0.8 g m-3, and 13.4  1.5 g m-3, respectively. Despite the significant reduction in the NO2 concentration, in UT stations average NO2 concentrations higher than 40 g m-3 were registered for several days. In order to reduce the pollution, the limitation of road traffic could be not enough, but a vision also aimed at rethink the vehicles and their polluting effects should be developed.","output":"Analysis of lockdown for CoViD-19 impact on NO2 in London, Milan and Paris: What lesson can be learnt?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies have been used for more than 100 years in the therapy of infectious diseases but a new generation of highly potent and/or broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (sometimes referred to as super-antibodies) offers new opportunities for intervention.

This differential impact has numerous possible explanations, each with significantly different policy implications. We examine, for the first time in a low- or middle-income country, which mechanisms best explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on the poor.Methods: We use primary data from the CoVIDA project, including the results of 59,770 RT-PCR tests in Bogota, targeted on a mostly asymptomatic adult population June 2020 to March 3rd, 2021. This is combined with administrative data that covers all reported cases in Bogota. We estimate a number of parameters that are likely to drive inequality in COVID-19 infection rates across socioeconomic groups, then use these estimates in an individual-level branching process model of the epidemic. We use counterfactual scenarios to estimate the relative importance of different channels for explaining inequality in infection rates.Findings: Total infections and inequalities in infections are largely driven by inequalities in the ability to work remotely and in within-home secondary attack rates. Inequalities in isolation behavior are less important but non-negligible, while access to testing and contract-tracing plays practically no role. Interventions that mitigate transmission are found to be more effective when targeted on socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.Interpretation: Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infections, and this appears to be driven by the need to work out of home, and higher transmission within home. Policies that can successfully reduce these channels of transmission among the poor are likely to have large benefits.Funding: The authors acknowledge generous support from the Interamerican Development Bank, the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the University of Los Andes and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Apart from eliminating the risk of being in a vulnerable environment during the pandemic such as a hospital setting, virtual arthroplasty follow-up reduces the demand on funding and resources on the National Health Services (NHS). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our shoulder arthroplasty patients (55) operated between October 2018 to November 2020 at both our hospital sites. For remote follow-up, patients were contacted on a scheduled appointment date via telephone by an orthopaedic surgeon to enquire about their wound, pain and function. Patients were questioned as per questionnaire from the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Standardised Assessment form. RESULTS: 50 patients were included in the final data set after excluding those who had died (5 patients). All patients had had final x-rays with full Covid-19 precautions at the time of final follow-up. No patient had wound problems except one who had concerns of wound appearance. There were no cases of notching, impingement, deep infection, dislocation or nerve injury. Of the 50 patients, 40 (80%) patients were satisfied to have a remote follow-up. 36 (72%) patients said they wouldn't mind a remote follow-up appointment. CONCLUSION: Remote follow-up via audio consultation may be an effective alternative to in person visits after shoulder arthroplasty.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the median duration of COVID\\\\19 signs and symptoms resolution and explore its predictors among symptomatic COVID\\\\19 patients in Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital\\\\based prospective cohort study involving 124 COVID\\\\19 cases was conducted at Eka Kotebe General Hospital, COVID\\\\19 Isolation and Treatment Center. The study participants were all symptomatic COVID\\\\19 adult patients admitted to the hospital from 18 March to 20 August 2020. Physicians at the centre recorded the data using a log sheet. Cox proportional\\\\hazards regression model was conducted. Statistical significance was defined at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 124 symptomatic COVID\\\\19 patients with a mean age of 42 years (17) were involved in the study. The median duration of symptom resolution of COVID\\\\19 was seven days with a minimum of two and a maximum of sixty\\\\eight days. Sex and body mass index (BMI) were statistically significant predictors of the symptom resolution. The hazard of having delayed sign or symptom resolution in males was 55% higher than in females (P = 0.039; CI: 0.22C0.96) and the hazard of delayed sign or symptom resolution in those with BMI  25 kg/m(2) was 35% higher than in those with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (P = 0.041; CI: 0.44C0.98]).

Eighty-six patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proven SARS-CoV-2 infection completed the trial protocol. Patients were stratified via the lottery method into two groups. Group A was administered standard of care (SOC) treatment as per existing hospital guidelines whereas group B was given ivermectin (single dose of 12 milligrams) along with SOC treatment. PCR was repeated at 72 hours, 7th day, and at 14th day of admission for both the groups and the point at which the PCR became negative was noted. Complete blood counts, liver function tests and renal function tests were done at recruitment, 7th day, and 14th day. The primary outcome was the viral clearance, measured as days to achieve PCR negativity. The secondary outcome was the development of any adverse side effects pertinent to ivermectin or derangement in baseline laboratory parameters. Results: In group A, 36 (80%) participants were males, and 9 (20%) were females, whereas in group B, 37 (90.2%) were males and 4 (9.8%) were females. Mean age was 39.0 +/- 12.6 and 42.2 +/- 12.0 years for groups A and B, respectively (p= 0.394). There was early viral clearance in group B as compared to group A (p=0.001). No adverse reaction or derangements in laboratory parameters was noted in the intervention arm during the trial period.

However, the benefit of endovascular treatment of ischemic stroke in the posterior circulation remains to be proven since it was excluded from these trials. We evaluate the benefit of endovascular treatment in posterior circulation strokes. Methods A total of 110 consecutive patients with posterior circulation stroke who underwent endovascular treatment in our institute in the period 1991-2015 were included. Recanalization rate according to modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score and neurological outcome at three months according to modified Rankin Scale were the main outcomes. Collateral circulation, procedural complications and radiological outcome were evaluated in the radiological examinations. Results The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 31 (IQR: 13-31) and median time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 300 (IQR: 175-463) minutes. Successful recanalization was seen in 80 of 110 patients (73%). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 2) was seen in 38 patients (35%) while moderate favorable outcome (3) was seen in 48 patients (44%).

Results show that the March 2020 lockdown had an impact on disease transmission, bringing the effective reproduction number (R(t)) below 1. We estimate that there was an increase in the transmission after the initial lift of the measures on 6 May 2020 that resulted in a second wave that was curbed by the October and November measures. December 2020 saw an increase in the transmission reaching an R(t) = 1.45 in early January 2021. Simulations indicate that the lockdown imposed on the 15 January 2021 might reduce the intensive care unit (ICU) demand to below 200 cases in early April if it lasts at least 2 months.

METHODS: A total of 675 T2DM patients and 572 non-T2DM patients were divided into low and high CysC groups and low and high CysC-rangeability groups according to serum CysC level and range of change of CysC level, respectively. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, and laboratory results of the four groups were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with a high level and rangeability of CysC had more organ damage and a higher risk of death compared with those with a low level or low rangeability of CysC. Patients with a higher level and rangeability of CysC had more blood lymphocytes and higher levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. After adjustment for possible confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that CysC >0.93 mg/dL was significantly associated with the risk of heart failure (OR = 2.231, 95% CI: 1.125C5.312) and all-cause death (2.694, 1.161C6.252).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concept consisted of 12 online seminars of the 11-week course \\"Imaging Procedures\\", which were combined with 31 prerecorded video presentations. Five weeks after the start of the summer term, we conducted an anonymous online survey, which consisted of 12 questions and a box for additional comments. Furthermore, we analysed the number of requests of the presentations, the duration and the average viewing time. RESULTS: In all, 110 of 213 students (51.6%) completed the survey; 72.7% stated that the new teaching concept drew their interest for radiology, 78.2% agreed that it incited self-study as well as would facilitate time- and place-independent learning (95.5%). The majority indicated that the time investment for the video presentations was appropriate, but shorter video sections would simplify the learning process (70.9%) and the ideal timeframe would be 10-20a?min.

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between German and Latin Switzerland were found for parents intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p <0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit Latin Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccination with carditis. DESIGN: CaseCcontrol study with hospital control participants. SETTING: Territory-wide, public health care database with linkage to population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Inpatients aged 12 years or older first diagnosed with carditis were selected as case patients. All other hospitalized patients without carditis were treated as control participants. Ten control participants were randomly matched with each case patient by age, sex, and admission date. INTERVENTION: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. MEASUREMENTS: Incident diagnosis of carditis based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and elevated troponin levels. RESULTS: A total of 160 case patients and 1533 control participants were included. Incidence of carditis per 100 000 doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 administered was estimated to be 0.31 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.66) and 0.57 (CI, 0.36 to 0.90), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine had higher odds of carditis (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.57 [CI, 1.93 to 6.60]) than unvaccinated persons. Stratified by sex, the OR was 4.68 (CI, 2.25 to 9.71) for males and 2.22 (CI, 0.57 to 8.69) for females receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine. The ORs for adults and adolescents receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine were 2.41 (CI, 1.18 to 4.90) and 13.79 (CI, 2.86 to 110.38), respectively. Subanalysis showed an OR of 9.29 (CI, 3.94 to 21.91) for myocarditis and 1.06 (CI, 0.35 to 3.22) for pericarditis associated with BNT162b2. The risk was mainly seen after the second dose of BNT162b2 rather than the first. No association between CoronaVac and carditis with a magnitude similar to that for BNT162b2 was seen. LIMITATION: Limited sample size, absence of electrocardiography and other clinical investigative data, and unrecorded overseas vaccination exposure. CONCLUSION: Despite a low absolute risk, there is an increased risk for carditis associated with BNT162b2 vaccination. This elevated risk should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination.

We aim to evaluate the observance, safety, tolerance, usability, and enjoyment of a new smartphone application. It was coupled with wearable sensors (BeatWalk) and delivered individualized musical stimulation for gait auto-rehabilitation at home. Forty-five patients with PD underwent a 1-month, outdoor, uncontrolled gait rehabilitation program, using the BeatWalk application (30 min/day, 5 days/week). The music tempo was being aligned in real-time to patients gait cadence in a way that could foster an increase up to +10% of their spontaneous cadence. Open-label evaluation was based on BeatWalk use measures, questionnaires, and a six-minute walk test. Patients used the application 78.8% (28.2) of the prescribed duration and enjoyed it throughout the program. The application was considered easy to use by 75% of the patients. Pain, fatigue, and falls did not increase. Fear of falling decreased and quality of life improved.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how family members and health care providers perceived this communication strategy. METHODS: The study was conducted in a 45-bed ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Communication with families consisted of a single daily telephone call from the senior physician in charge of the patient to the patient's surrogate decision maker. Satisfaction was qualitatively assessed via an anonymous online questionnaire with open-ended questions. RESULTS: Participants completed 114 questionnaires. Forty-six percent of surrogate decision makers stated that the key medical messages were understandable, but 57% of other family members expressed that the frequency of information delivery was insufficient. Fifty-six percent of the physicians described the practice as functional for the organization of the unit. Among health care providers other than physicians, 55% felt that not having to interact with families decreased their emotional load and 50% mentioned saving time and the absence of task interruptions as positive aspects.

Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron.

Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research.

Random-effects model was applied for pooling hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals related to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS Fourteen articles with 2,743 patients were included in the study. According to the analysis, high PLR had no correlation with decreased OS. Due to high heterogeneity among studies, subgroup analysis was performed. Better OS was associated with low PLR in Asian patients, patients with mixed type of operation performed, and patients with preoperative PLR 150. Low PLR was associated with significantly better DFS.

Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/L versus 70/L, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/L, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively.

Some of them are currently used, such as HER2 inhibitors, while others are still under development, such as cell cycle (CDK) inhibitors, immune checkpoint (PD1/PDL1) inhibitors, or molecules acting on DNA damage (PARP) repair. Besides this, radiation therapy (RT) is commonly used either as adjuvant treatment for early BC after breast conservative surgery or in palliative intent for the treatment of metastatic sites. Our research has shown that the combinations of the most commonly used targeted treatments and RT were feasible with a few toxicities. Nevertheless, most of the knowledge on this subject is based on retrospective studies and a small number of patients and care should be taken in this setting until these results would be confirmed in prospective randomized studies. ABSTRACT: Background: The objective of the present study was to review the essential knowledge about the combinations of the most commonly used or under development targeted treatments and radiation therapy (RT). Methods: Preclinical and clinical studies investigating this combination were extensively reviewed. Results: Several studies showed that the combination of RT and tamoxifen increased the risk of radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity; therefore, both modalities should not be given concomitantly. The combination of HER2 inhibitors (trastuzumab, pertuzumab) and RT seems to be safe. However, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) should not be administered concurrently with brain RT since this combination could increase the risk of brain radionecrosis. The combination of RT and other new target treatments such as selective estrogen receptor degradants, lapatinib, cell cycle inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or molecules acting on DNA damage repair seems feasible but was essentially evaluated on retrospective or prospective studies with a small number of patients. Furthermore, there is considerable heterogeneity among these studies regarding the dose and fractionation of radiation, the dosage of drugs, and the sequence of treatments used. Conclusions: The combination of RT with most targeted therapies for BC appears to be well-tolerated, but these results need to be confirmed in prospective randomized studies.","output":"Combination of Modern Radiotherapy and New Targeted Treatments for Breast Cancer Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviride is a colossal family of viruses that cause a variety of diseases in humans and other animals.

Here we have utilised RNA-seq to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression increases cellular expression of several members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), including the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

These data identify ILRUN as a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the RAAS.

Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions and the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies and new knowledge and tools to better protect against the impacts of disease. The human protein-coding gene ILRUN is a recently-characterised inhibitor of the transcription regulators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Here we present the first evidence that ILRUN modulation has implications for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Virus infectivity assays confirmed that gene silencing of ILRUN had a proviral effect and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, whilst over-expression of ILRUN inhibited SARS-CoV-2 production. Additionally, we observed that ILRUN also regulates the expression of key elements of the RAAS.

Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 64 patients with other disease severity (mild, n = 10, moderate, n = 32, severe, n = 12) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and prolonged humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels.

In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients.

However, such claims do not consider novel trends among plurilateral summit institutions, especially the extent to which global governance of a green recovery is encapsulated by the burgeoning norm bundle of the Global Green New Deal. Plurilateral summit institutions like the G20, G7 and the BRICS have the potential to play a key governance role in implementing a Global Green New Deal, given the breadth and depth of reform required to build back better from COVID-19. This contribution adopts a practice-relationist methodology to explore this thesis. Green recovery practice is analysed through novel interrogation of the open-source stimulus spending data of the Global Recovery Observatory. The results reveal that the G7, the G20 and the BRICS are all funding proportionally more clean than dirty stimulus in response to COVID-19. However, the proportion of clean stimulus is much stronger among members of the G7. A relationist frame is then used to assess this practice against the potential norm entrepreneurship role of the G7, both as individual member states and as a collective. It concludes that although this norm entrepreneurship role is undoubtedly nascent, it yields valuable insights into the pathways and barriers for further norm diffusion of the Global Green New Deal among plurilateral summit institutions. In this way it highlights the unique role plurilateral summit institutions can play in not only globalising the green new deal, but crucially operationalising it.

Indeed, wildlife trade exposes humans to a plethora of severe emerging infectious diseases, some of which have contributed to the most dramatic global pandemics humankind has endured. Illegal wildlife trade is often considered as a problem of developing countries but it is first and foremost an international global business with a trade flow from developing to developed countries. The devastating effects of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak should thus be an unassailable argument for European decision makers to change paradigm. Rather than deploying efforts and money to combat novel pathogens, mitigating the risk of spreading emerging infectious diseases should be addressed and be part of any sustainable socioeconomic development plan. Stricter control procedures at borders and policies should be enforced. Additionally, strengthening research in wildlife forensic science and developing a network of forensic laboratories should be the cornerstone of the European Union plan to tackle the illegal wildlife trade. Such proactive approach, that should further figure in the EU-Wildlife Action Plan, could produce a win-win situation: the curb of illegal wildlife trade would subsequently diminish the likelihood of importing new zoonotic diseases in the European Union.","output":"Addressing the illegal wildlife trade in the European Union as a public health issue to draw decision makers attention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immunological and pathophysiological response to COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory impairment affecting gas exchange and lung mechanics.

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes. We used logistic regression to identify associations between vitamin D variables and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 417,342 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to look for evidence of a causal effect. In total, 1746 COVID-19 cases (399 deaths) were registered between March and June 2020. We found no significant associations between COVID-19 infection risk and measured 25-OHD levels after adjusted for covariates, but this finding is limited by the fact that the vitamin D levels were measured on average 11 years before the pandemic. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and death overall and consistently after stratification by BMI and ethnicity. We also observed an interaction that suggested greater protective effect of genetically-predicted vitamin D levels when ambient UVB radiation is stronger. The main MR analysis did not show that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels are causally associated with COVID-19 risk (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.55C1.11, P = 0.160), but MR sensitivity analyses indicated a potential causal effect (weighted mode MR: OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55C0.95, P = 0.021; weighted median MR: OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.42C0.92, P = 0.016).

Transcriptomics is an essential part of modern biomedical research based on highly sophisticated and reliable technology. Transcriptomics can aid clinical practice and improve the precision of clinical diagnoses and decision-making by complementing existing clinical best practice. The power of which will be increased when combined with genomic variation from genome wide association studies and next generation sequencing. We are witnessing the implementation of RNA-based technologies in clinical practice that will eventually lead to the establishment of transcriptional medicine as a routine tool in diagnosis. Progress in genomic analytical technologies has improved our possibilities to obtain information regarding DNA, RNA, and their dynamic changes that occur over time or in response to specific challenges. This information describes the blueprint for cells, tissues, and organisms and has fundamental importance for all living organisms. This review focuses on the technological challenges to analyze the transcriptome and what is the impact of transcriptomics on precision medicine. The transcriptome is a term that covers all RNA present in cells and a substantial part of it will never be translated into protein but is nevertheless functional in determining cell phenotype. Recent developments in transcriptomics have challenged the fundamentals of the central dogma of biology by providing evidence of pervasive transcription of the genome. Such massive transcriptional activity is challenging the definition of a gene and especially the term \\"pseudogene\\" that has now been demonstrated in many examples to be both transcribed and translated. We also review the common sources of biomaterials for transcriptomics and justify the suitability of whole blood RNA as the current optimal analyte for clinical transcriptomics. At the end of the review, a brief overview of the clinical implications of transcriptomics in clinical trial design and clinical diagnosis is given.

African-Americans and older patients have less frequently used electronic messaging with their physicians. This study compares the utilization of virtual health care before and during the COVID pandemic for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS A chart review of all IBD patients seen at an academic medical center from 2014-2020 was conducted to evaluate the use of telehealth options (e-messaging, e-visits) during a pre-COVID and COVID timeframe. Analysis of telehealth use from March - August 2018 and March - August 2020 was performed. Patient age, gender, race, IBD type, electronic messaging and telehealth visits were obtained. A confidential database was created. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher Exact test with significance set at p < 0.05. The study was IRB approved. RESULTS 392 patients were in the pre-COVID cohort. There were 204 White, 99 African-American, 11 Asian, and 78 racially un-identified patients. 160 (40.8%) initiated E-communication with their physicians. There was a significant difference in the use of e-messaging based upon age (51.1% < 50 vs 39.7%  50; p = 0.0396) and race (62.3% White vs 28.2% African-American; p < 0.00001).There were no significant differences in the use of e-messaging based upon patient gender (p = 0.6840) or IBD type (p = 0.6374). There were 295 patients in the COVID cohort. There were 155 White, 83 African American patients, 24 Hispanic patients, 10 Asian patients, and 22 racially un-identified patients. 109 (36.9%) utilized a telehealth option (53 via e-messaging; 56 via telemedicine visit). There was no significant difference in the use of a telehealth option based upon age (36.8% < 50 vs 37.25%  50 years; p = 1.00), race (42.6% White vs 35.9% African-American; p = 0.2693) or IBD type (p = 0.331).

However, evidences on the inter-relation between psychological distress and reproductive medicine are still conflicting. METHODS: The national lockdown imposed in Italy in March-May 2020 and the consequent assisted reproductive techniques (ART) activity blockage allowed to evaluate the conception ability of couples who suffered the postponement of ART cycles. In particular, we collected anamnestic, anthropometrical and demographic data of those women attending ART straddling the lockdown period attending to the Fertility Centre of Reggio Emilia. RESULTS: Among the 431 couples recalled to reschedule ART cycles, 34 couples (7.9%) obtained a spontaneous pregnancy during the lockdown. Comparing spontaneously pregnant to non-pregnant women, the pregnant group resulted younger (P = 0.009) and with a shorter infertility history (P = 0.029). Interestingly, the sexual activity frequency was significantly higher in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant ones (P < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic analysis, number of sexual intercourses per week and the infertility history duration were significantly related to pregnancy (P < 0.001 and P = 0.030, respectively). In addition, the application of neural network technology including data about women age, body mass index, infertility duration, weekly sexual intercourses and infertility causes allowed to correctly classify pregnant women with an accuracy of 92.7%. CONCLUSION: The high pregnancy rate observed in a very short time-frame interval probably revealed an under-explored cause of idiopathic infertility, that is the frequency of sexual intercourses, resulting the best predictive variable on achieving a spontaneous pregnancy. This factor is commonly under-investigated during the anamnestic workup of infertile couples.

Various risk factors affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, such as age, gender, ethnicity, comorbid conditions, and laboratory parameters. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children are asymptomatic mild degrees or with acute upper respiratory tract symptoms and moderate degrees with clinical pneumonia. In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, several biomarkers are needed that can be useful in risk stratification to predict the severity and fatality of COVID-19. Several biomarkers are used as markers of disease progression to a critical degree, such as leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, interleukin-6, and serum ferritin. Increased leukocytes and neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes are associated with severity and mortality in COVID-19. Laboratory findings in children with COVID-19 include decreased lymphocytes, leukopenia, and increased procalcitonin. In severe COVID-19, children often have abnormal laboratory parameters that suggest a systemic inflammatory response. AIM: This study aims to compare leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes levels in children with the complaints of shortness of breath with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an analytic study with a cross-sectional approach to pediatric patients treated in Haji Adam Malik General Hospital Medan with the complaints of shortness of breath. Patient data were assessed based on the characteristic values of hemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction results and then analyzed using SPSS for Windows software.

APPROACH Following the SARS outbreak, China made huge investments to improve surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capacity and strengthen public health institutions. In 2013, the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China's early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans. LOCAL SETTING Clusters of human infection with a novel influenza virus were detected in China - by national surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology - on 26 February 2013. RELEVANT CHANGES On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Poultry markets - which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans - were closed down in the affected areas. Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated. The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication. New cases were reported promptly and publicly. LESSONS LEARNT The relevant infrastructures, surveillance systems and response capacity need to be strengthened in preparation for future emergencies caused by emerging or existing disease threats. Results of risk assessments and other data should be released promptly and publicly and such release should not jeopardize future publication of the data in scientific journals.

A common barrier to providing this evidence-based practice is diagnostic uncertainty. We sought to test the hypothesis that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019, in whom acute respiratory distress syndrome is easily recognized, would be more likely to receive low tidal volume ventilation than concurrently admitted acute respiratory distress syndrome patients without coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals of a single health system. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 or noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome as identified by an automated, electronic acute respiratory distress syndrome finder in clinical use at study hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 333 coronavirus disease 2019 patients and 234 noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, the average initial tidal volume was 6.4 cc/kg predicted body weight and 6.8 cc/kg predicted body weight, respectively. Patients had tidal volumes less than or equal to 6.5 cc/kg predicted body weight for a mean of 70% of the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in the coronavirus disease 2019 cohort, compared with 52% in the noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort (unadjusted p < 0.001). After adjusting for height, gender, admitting hospital, and whether or not the patient was admitted to a medical specialty ICU, coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis was associated with a 21% higher percentage of time receiving tidal volumes less than or equal to 6.5 cc/kg predicted body weight within the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation (95% CI, 14C28%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to low tidal volume ventilation during the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation is higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 than with acute respiratory distress syndrome without coronavirus disease 2019.

Methods: We included studies describing health disparities towards Blacks/AAs in the USA during the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics. Only observational empirical studies with free full-text availability in English from PubMed, PubMed Central and Google Scholar were included. Results: A total of 31 papers were included: 19 pertaining to the H1N1 pandemic and 12 to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative analysis for health disparities resulted in 43 different factors, which were subdivided into nine overarching themes. Discussion: The similarities that exist between the two pandemics indicate that there are many neglected issues in American healthcare that need to be addressed. The listed factors have led to disparities in screening and treating for disease resulting in disparities in infection rates, severity of illness and mortality. This calls for a change in healthcare dynamics to improve access to healthcare, remove any form of possible discrimination, and regain the lost trust with the Black/AA communities, repairing historical damage.

National guidelines recommend that healthcare workers (HCW) who use N95 masks require fit testing. Quantitative fit testing requires the purchasing and use of fit testing solutions and associated equipment. In high volume, these solutions are expensive and may not be readily available, as was seen in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine how a homemade solution compared against a commercially available product and a placebo. METHODS: Afit test was performed on the same person, on three separate occasions, using three different solutions C commercial (45% sodium saccharin), homemade (to be disclosed) and placebo (water). The solution was double blinded and solutions were chosen and administered in a random order. RESULTS: Atotal of 48 people participated in this study.At the threshold testing stage, 8.3% did not taste any solution, 16.7% of people could taste the placebo, 89.6% could taste the commercial solution and 91.7% could taste the homemade solution. All persons who could taste the commercial solution could taste homemade solution. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study suggest that fit testing solutions could be made locally with a similar effect to that of commercial products, that quantitative fit testing is unreliable and that serious consideration should be given to the role of quantitative fit testing in future guidelines and standards. We recommend that this study be conducted on a larger scale to support our findings.","output":"Can homemade fit testing solutions be as effective as commercial products?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, enormous efforts have been made to understand the genus SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high rate of global transmission, mutations in the viral genome were inevitable. A full understanding of the viral genome and its possible changes represents one of the crucial aspects of pandemic management. Structural protein S plays an important role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, mutations occurring at this level leading to viral forms with increased affinity for ACE2 receptors, higher transmissibility and infectivity, resistance to neutralizing antibodies and immune escape, increasing the risk of infection and disease severity. Thus, five variants of concern are currently being discussed, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. In the present review, a comprehensive summary of the following critical aspects regarding SARS-CoV-2 has been made: (i) the genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) the pathological mechanism of transmission, penetration into the cell and action on specific receptors; (iii) mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; and (iv) possible implications of mutations in diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: An Overview of the Genetic Profile and Vaccine Effectiveness of the Five Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States fishing and seafood industries experienced major shifts in consumer demand and social-distancing restrictions starting in March 2020, when the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were unfolding. However, the specific effects on fishers and seafood processors are less well known. Fishermen and seafood workers are potentially at risk during a pandemic given existing tight working quarters, seasonal work, and long hours. To address these concerns, and given a lack of data on the sector, we reviewed news articles, scientific articles, and white papers to assess the various effects of COVID-19 on US seafood workers. Here, we show that most COVID-19 cases among seafood workers occurred during summer 2020 and during the beginning of 2021. These cases were documented across coastal areas, with Alaska experiencing the largest number of cases and outbreaks. Seafood workers were about twice as likely to contract COVID-19 as workers in other parts of the overall US food system. We also documented a number of indirect effects of the pandemic. New social-distancing restrictions and policies limited crew size, resulting in longer hours and more physical taxation. Because of changes in demand and the closure of some processing plants because of COVID-19 outbreaks, economic consequences of the pandemic were a primary concern for fishers and seafood workers, and safety measures allowed for seafood price variation and losses throughout the pandemic. We also highlight a number of inequities in COVID-19 responses within the seafood sector, both along racial and gender lines. All of these conditions point to the diverse direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fishers and seafood workers. We hope this work sets the foundation for future work on the seafood sector in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, improving the overall workplace, and collecting systematic social and economic data on workers.","output":"The direct and indirect effects of a global pandemic on US fishers and seafood workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perception of self-isolation at home in patients with cancer during the lockdown period resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted through an online survey of patients with cancer who were sheltering at home from 29th March to 3rd May 2020. Perception of self-isolation was assessed using the ISOLA scale, after evaluation of its psychometric properties. Content analysis was used to analyse two open-ended questions. RESULTS: The participants were 195 adult patients with cancer (female = 76%; mean age = 50.3  11.2; haematological malignancy = 51.3%). They reported moderate isolation-related suffering (M = 2.64  0.81), problems in their relationships with others (M = 3.31  1.13) and difficulties in their relationships with themselves (M = 3.14  1.06).

Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk for severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Observation: We present expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic. The overarching goals of these approaches are to reduce the number of visits to a healthcare facility, reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive non-operative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Non-operative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules. The order of treatments may be based on patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. Conclusions and Relevance: The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is significantly elevated for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The side effects of this treatment are not known; therefore, this study was performed to determine the final outcome and complications of hemoperfusion in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, all patients with severe COVID-19 without any comorbidities or organ failure who underwent hemoperfusion treatment in ICU at Kosar Hospital in Semnan, Iran, during March - November 2021 were included. The clinical data and short-term complications up to 10 days after hemoperfusion and the final outcome were extracted from medical files. RESULTS: The mean age of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing hemoperfusion was 57.515.9 years. Most (24, 60%) patients were male. The time interval from hospitalization to hemoperfusion and the time interval between hemoperfusion and final outcome was 4.85 days and 8.30 days, respectively. Arrhythmia, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders were the most common short-term complications of hemoperfusion in patients with COVID-19, respectively. Most complications occurred on the second and third days after hemoperfusion. Mortality occurred in 20 (50 %) patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing hemoperfusion in ICU.

Bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients at increased risk of bleeding and low risk of recurrent ischemic events. We aimed to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individuals bleeding risk. METHODS: We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE [Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events], ESPS-2 [European Stroke Prevention Study-2], MATCH [Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients], CHARISMA [Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance], ESPRIT [European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial], and PRoFESS [Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes]) investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase after noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to their predicted risk of major bleeding with the S(2)TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events was assessed per quintile for 4 scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenario. RESULTS: Thirty seven thousand eighty-seven patients were included in the analyses. Both risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events increased over quintiles of predicted bleeding risk, but risk of ischemic events was consistently higher (eg, from 0.7%/y (bottom quintile) to 3.2%/y (top quintile) for major bleeding on aspirin and from 2.5%/y to 10.2%/y for risk of ischemic events on aspirin). Treatment with aspirin-clopidogrel led to more major bleedings (0.9%C1.7% per year), than reduction in ischemic events (ranging from 0.4% to 0.9/1.0% per year) across all quintiles. There was no clear preference for either aspirin-dipyridamole or clopidogrel according to baseline bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke included in clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy, the risk of recurrent ischemic events and of major bleeding increase in parallel. Antiplatelet treatment cannot be individualized solely based on bleeding risk assessment.","output":"Balancing Benefits and Risks of Long-Term Antiplatelet Therapy in Noncardioembolic Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) recently emerged as a global pandemic. Advanced age is the most important risk factor for increased virus susceptibility and worse outcomes. Many older adults are currently treated with reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and there is concern that these medications might increase the risk of mortality by COVID-19. This is a retrospective cohort of 346 patients older than 65 years with COVID-19, at the Department of Medicine of the Centro Hospitalar Universitrio Lisboa Norte, in Portugal, hospitalized between March 2020 and August 2020. Mean age was 80.9  8.7 years old. Most patients had arterial hypertension (n = 279, 80.6%), almost half (n = 161, 46.5%) had cardiovascular disease and approximately one-third of patients had heart failure (n = 127, 36.7%) or diabetes Mellitus (n = 113, 32.7%). Ninety-eight patients (28.3%) had chronic kidney disease and almost half of the patients (49.4%) were chronically under reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Twenty percent of patients died during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis, older age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04, 1.18, p = 0.002), absence of baseline medication with RAAS inhibitors (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10, 0.75, p = 0.011), higher serum ferritin (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00, 1.00, p = 0.003) and higher lactate levels (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.14, p = 0.006) were independent predictors of mortality. Older age, higher serum ferritin and lactate levels at admission were found to be independent predictors of mortality and might act as early predictors of worsening disease in clinical practice.

This study employed a qualitative descriptive design to examine content related to COVID-19 vaccines posted by Twitter users located in Africa. Methods : Data were collected from Twitter between the 11 th and the 16 th of December 2020 using the NCapture tool. We searched Twitter using the terms 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19 vaccine' and 'Africa' to identify the nature and content of tweets related to COVID-19 and vaccines shared by Twitter users from the African region. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of Twitter accounts and thematic analysis helped determine, analyse, and clarify patterns of meaning (themes) emerging from the tweets. Results : The study found n=208 Twitter accounts, the majority (n=69;33%) from South Africa and most (42%;n=87) from news agencies. The final dataset included n=212 tweets. The most used hashtag was #Covid19vaccine(s). Four themes were identified: i) capacity for vaccine production, ii) vaccine procurement, iii) vaccine logistics, and iv) perceived safety and efficacy of vaccines. The capacity of countries in Africa to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine was deemed minimal and most tweets questioned Africas ability to procure vaccines based on the costs. Tweets also centred around the distribution of vaccines, storage and roll-out and the need to leverage existing solar-powered technologies to enhance the cold supply chain in Africa's remote locations. Questions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines developed in under one year were also raised. Conclusions: Concerns about vaccine procurement and readiness for distribution were dominant topics.

This study was implemented to identify risk factors for sepsis by CR- and carbapenem-susceptible (CS) GNB in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to improve management strategies for CR-GNB sepsis. METHODS: We developed a case-case-control study from a prospective cohort of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis-2 or sepsis-3 criteria in which blood and other sample cultures were collected and antimicrobial therapy was instituted, in an adult clinical-surgical ICU, at tertiary public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, from August 2015 through March 2017. RESULTS: Among the total of 629 ICU admissions followed by 7797 patient-days, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria we identified 184 patients who developed recurrent or single hospital-acquired sepsis. More than 90% of all evaluable cases of sepsis and 87% of control group fulfilled the modified sepsis-3 definition. Non-fermenting bacilli and ventilator-associated pneumonia predominated as etiology and source of CR-GNB sepsis. While Enterobacteriaceae and intra-abdominal surgical site plus urinary-tract infections prevailed in CS-GNB than CR-GNB sepsis. Carbapenemase production was estimated in 76% of CR-GNB isolates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed previous infection (mostly hospital-acquired bacterial infection or sepsis) (OR = 4.28; 95% CI 1.77C10.35), mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.21; 95% CI 1.17C15.18), carbapenem use (OR = 3.42; 95% CI 1.37C8.52) and length of hospital stay (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01C1.05) as independent risk factors for sepsis by CR-GNB.

Here we report the clinical features of 66 hemodialysis patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020; the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020. RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively).

While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted between March 27(th) and April 5(th), 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. CONCLUSION: Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","output":"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: coping with isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forensic e-mental health is an area of psychology that is relatively underdeveloped considering technological advancements and the many mental health needs of justice-involved individuals It includes the procurement, storage, sharing, and provision of forensic mental health information and services via electronic means and is associated with improved accessibility, efficiency, cost-savings, and safety During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinics, hospitals, jails, prisons, and the courts rapidly adopted these modalities for service continuity out of necessity, rather than choice In the absence of formal guidelines, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers were left searching for answers: what forensic e-mental health technologies are available, what was their research evidence, and what could the future hold?

COVID19 convalescent plasma has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID19 pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized COVID19 patients treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma in a prospective, observational multicenter trial. Methods: From April 2020 through August 2020, hospitalized COVID19 patients at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) and compared to hospitalized patients with COVID19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. CCP-treated and untreated COVID19 hospitalized patients were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality. Results: 542 total hospitalized COVID19 patients were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized COVID19 patients were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the CCP-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in CCP-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared to controls. In subgroup analysis of CCP-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.

Leadership in digital health services is a term that has been used in the literature with various meanings. Conceptualization of leadership in digital health services is needed to deliver higher quality digital health services, update existing leadership practices, and advance research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to outline a concept analysis that aims to clarify and define the concept of leadership in digital health services. METHODS: The concept analysis will be performed using the Walker and Avant model, which involves eight steps: concept selection, determination of aims, identification of uses, determination of defining attributes, construction of a model case, construction of additional cases, identification of antecedents and consequences, and definition of empirical referents. A scoping literature search will be performed following the search protocol for scoping reviews by the Joanna Briggs Institute to identify all relevant literature on leadership in digital health services. Searches will be conducted in 6 scientific databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and the Finnish database Medic), and unpublished studies and gray literature will be searched using Google Scholar, EBSCO Open Dissertations, and MedNar. RESULTS: An initial limited search of MEDLINE was undertaken on October 19, 2020, resulting in 883 records. The results of the concept analysis will be submitted for publication by July 2021.

Focusing on results from 17,250 epidemiological investigations performed during early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Israel, we show that the distribution of carriers of the respiratory severe acute syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is spatially correlated with two satellite-derived surface metrics: night light intensity and landscape patchiness, the latter being a measure to the urban landscapes scale-dependent spatial heterogeneity. We find that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 carriers was significantly more likely to occur in patchy parts of the city, where the urban landscape is characterized by high levels of spatial heterogeneity at relatively small scales (~10-100m). We suggest that this spatial association reflects a scale-dependent constraint imposed by the citys morphology on the cumulative behavior of the people inhabiting it.

We analyzed its effect on the cytopathology subspecialty practice and resident education at our institution. Design Specimen volumes were analyzed for the cytology practice for 2019 and 2020. Patient registration and elective and scheduled surgery volumes were also included in the analysis for 2020. The impact of innovative concepts, such as virtual teaching, on resident teaching was evaluated using a survey consisting of five multiple choice questions with four possible responses each. Results The total number of specimens decreased by 28% in March 2020 (p<0.00001), with a continuing decline in April (66% decrease YoY, p<0.00001), followed by recovery in May and return to baseline within June 2020. Specimen volumes continued to show an upward trend thereafter. Improved specimen volumes correlated with patient registration and surgical volumes. The majority of residents considered virtual teaching conferences (75%) and self-study sets (58%) as beneficial and did not view absence of one-on-one microscope learning (58%) as significantly affecting their education. Conclusion The recovery curve for our cytopathology service was V-shaped, essentially the most ideal response to an economic downturn. The majority of residents viewed virtual teaching conferences and self-study sets favorably and did not regard absence of one-on-one microscope learning as adversely affecting their education.","output":"Financial and Educational Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Academic Hospital-Based Tertiary Cytopathology Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need of real-time enterprises increases according to our life style and customers' satisfaction goal Real-time business process is one of the important components of a real-time enterprise For that, a formal definition of real-time concept and real-time process was indispensable This work presents a formal definition of real-time concept, real-time ontology and a proposition of a real-time component with real-time attributes This new dimension of time contains three components: latency time, acceptance interval and theoretical time This definition gives a new vision of time, not just an ordinary vision as periods and calendar but as a response to our needs in real-time enterprises: real-time Before the proposition of a real-time component for BPMN language, which we applicate to Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) management process, as case study ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Business Process Modeling Notation Extension for Real Time Handling - Application to Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) management process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of epidemiological models for decision-making has been prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 45 US children's hospitals between April 2020 to September 2020 of pediatric patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed factors associated with hospitalization and factors associated with clinical severity (eg, admission to inpatient floor, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], admission to ICU with mechanical ventilation, shock, death) among those hospitalized. RESULTS: Among 19,976 COVID-19 encounters, 15,913 (79.7%) patients were discharged from the emergency department (ED) and 4063 (20.3%) were hospitalized. The clinical severity distribution among those hospitalized was moderate (3222, 79.3%), severe (431, 11.3%), and very severe (380, 9.4%). Factors associated with hospitalization vs discharge from the ED included private payor insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],1.16; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), obesity/type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) (aOR, 10.4; 95% CI, 8.9-13.3), asthma (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6), cardiovascular disease, (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.3- 5.8), immunocompromised condition (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 5.0-6.7), pulmonary disease (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.4-8.2), and neurologic disease (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-5.8).

Materials & Methods: Data of 98 readmitted patients to the Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran were reviewed from December 22, 2019 through June 20, 2020. We classified the readmitted patients into three groups: patients (1) without COVID-19 symptoms, (2) with suspected COVID-19, and (3) with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results: Our data revealed that the frequency of gender was significantly different between the groups (with higher frequency in men). The duration between the two admissions was significantly low in the confirmed COVID-19 group. Ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were more common in confirmed COVID-19 group. High levels of CRP, and ESR were detected in the confirmed COVID-19 group. During the first admission, the WBC count was significantly lower in the confirmed COVID-19 group, the RBC count and hemoglobin level were significantly higher in both first and second admissions in the confirmed COVID-19 group.

One of the main problems concerning this complication is its early diagnostics. In this study, the authors attempt to provide new data regarding the usage of novel kidney injury biomarkers in early detection of acute kidney injury and in the prognosis of the long-term postoperative kidney function. Perioperative factors that may influence kidney function were also analysed. It was concluded that biomarkers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, MMP-9 and NGAL are reliable acute kidney injury indicators. It was also demonstrated that intraoperative hypoperfusion secondary to hypovolemia is a main factor that damages the kidneys during cardiac surgeries. The authors hope that these findings will contribute to the development of new diagnostic protocols for acute kidney injury, which would involve novel renal biomarkers, thus enabling quicker diagnosis and more effective treatment of acute kidney injury. ABSTRACT: Background: There is a need for early diagnostic solutions for cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) as serum creatinine changes do not occur dynamically enough. Moreover, new approaches are needed for kidney protective strategy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures; Methods: Samples of serum and urine were taken from the selected group of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of specific inflammation and kidney injury biomarkers in the early diagnostic of CSA-AKI and in the prognosis of long-term postoperative kidney function; Results: At 6 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, there were significant differences in IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, MMP-9 and NGAL concentrations in patients with CSA-AKI, compared to the control group. Serum IL-8 and urine NGAL 6 h after weaning from CPB proved to be independent acute kidney injury predictors. The TNF-, MMP-9, IL-18, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in the early postoperative period correlated with long-term kidney function impairment; Conclusions: Novel kidney injury biomarkers are an eligible tool for early diagnosis of CSA-AKI. They are also reliable indicators of long-term postoperative kidney function impairment risk after cardiac surgery procedures.","output":"Assessment and Prognosis in CSA-AKI Using Novel Kidney Injury Biomarkers: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main achievements in the development of methods for the design of semisynthetic antibiotics of a new generation belonging to the group of polycyclic glycopeptides directed against infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria and dangerous human and animal viruses are reviewed.

Measures such as social distancing and travel restrictions, have disrupted production and supply chains, reinforcing a demand shock. In the midst of this pandemic, however, there are leaders of resilient firms that are effectively responding to these changing times. Using a multiple-case inductive enquiry, the paper analyses how leaders activate resilience in small businesses. Employing a process framework, which focuses on sequences of activities and their interrelations which we analyse to uncover how these leaders activated this resilience and explicitly integrated the literature of resilience with that of sensemaking. Resilience emerges when cognition and behaviour work in conjunction, with businesses adapting to combat the crisis. When it comes to global disruptive crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, extant literature provides us with little guidance. The study not only makes a number of contributions to extant literatures but also provides valuable insights and tools to help leaders effectively navigate and respond to this crisis.

A few factors have been recognized that affect it, such as the patient's personality, the severity of psychopathology, and diagnosis. Other factors, such as patient's and clinician's gender, have not been specifically investigated. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of gender differences on the clinician's subjective experience in a large sample of psychiatric patients. Methods: The study involved 61 psychiatrists and 960 patients attending several inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings. The clinicians completed the Assessment of Clinician's Subjective Experience (ACSE) questionnaire after observing each patient for the first time. Results: In multivariate analysis, higher scores on the Difficulty in Attunement (p < 0.001), Engagement (p<0.05), and Impotence (p<0.01) scales were significantly associated with female clinician gender, whereas higher scores on the Tension and Disconfirmation scales were significantly associated with male clinician gender. The scores on all ACSE dimensions were also associated with the severity of psychopathology. Conclusion: The findings suggest that clinician's gender might affect a clinician's emotional response toward patients.

METHODS: Continuous pressure NIV was applied to 20 subjects using Total Face, Nasal, and Face masks for 10 min each. Tidal volume (VT) and respiratory period (RP) were estimated from respiratory inductance plethysmography. Electrodermal activity was estimated from conductance signals. Heart rate variability was measured using the time-domain indices SDNN and RMSSD, and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude (RSAp). Parameters were referenced to 5-min rest periods at beginning and end of protocol. A Likert-like scale of subjective discomfort with the masks and the ventilation was applied after 1, 5, and 9 min using each mask. RESULTS: RP and VT increased with the three mask models. Whereas the mean heart rate and RSAp did not change, both SDNN and RMSSD increased during NIV with Nasal and Face masks. Spontaneous electrodermal activity fluctuations were less frequent during NIV than at rest, with significant differences for Total Face and Nasal masks. Discomfort with all masks increased from minutes 1 to 9, markedly in the Total Face mask, considered most uncomfortable by 11 subjects.

The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS: There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed.

The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen and worsening of infections.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of an online clinical rotation in Obstetrics and Gynecology during the Covid-19 pandemic and to identify effective pedagogical modalities as well as obstacles to online learning. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the students and staff at the end of the 3-week online rotation. The online curriculum included synchronous learning such as problem-based learning, video demonstrations and discussions, as well as asynchronous pre-recorded lectures. Questions addressed expectations, previous experience, difficulties encountered, effectiveness of different types of pedagogy, and willingness to participate in online education in the future. RESULTS: We received 27 completed questionnaires, 77% response rate. Overall course rating was 4.14/5 from the students and 3.38/5 from the staff. Previous experience in online education had a positive correlation with higher overall course evaluations; however, low expectations of effectiveness of online learning prior to the course did not correlate with the overall course rate. Challenges identified were absence of bedside teaching and lack of feedback. Effective pedagogical modules were problem-based learning and videos. Additionally, 72% stated that online learning should be part of the formal curriculum.

Our objective in the present study was to determine if ICP elevation from cerebral venous outflow obstruction would result in comparable alterations in the LLA. METHODS Anesthetized juvenile pigs were assigned to one of two groups: na?ve ICP (n = 15) or high ICP (>20 mmHg; n = 20). To elevate ICP through venous obstruction, a modified 5F esophageal balloon catheter was inserted via the right external jugular vein into the superior vena cava (SVC) and inflated to maintain an ICP of >20 mmHg. To calculate the LLA, gradual hypotension was induced by continuous hemorrhage from a catheter in the femoral vein. The LLA was determined by monitoring cortical laser Doppler flux (LDF). RESULTS The na?ve and high ICP groups had LLAs of 45 mmHg (95% CI: 41-49 mmHg) and 71 mmHg (95% CI: 66-77 mmHg) respectively by LDF. The LLA was significantly different between the two groups and correlated significantly with ICP. DISCUSSION Elevated ICP from cephalic venous engorgement leads to an increase in the LLA.

First, this study investigates the integrated vulnerability (IV) of 12 districts of Taipei by overlaying natural vulnerability (NV) and social vulnerability (SV). This study selects four districts with high IV and low IV in Taipei, and with a large proportion of flooded areas, as the study sites. Second, a questionnaire survey (600 respondents) is conducted to examine the correlations between place attachment and the individual attributes of the respondents (age, residence duration, disaster experience, and education) in the four districts. Third, factor analyses are carried out to categorize place attachment into four factors: security, familiarity, belongingness, and rootedness. Finally, whether different factors have different relationships with place attachment are elucidated. The results show no consistent correlations between place attachment and individual attributes in areas with different vulnerabilities. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations before and after factor analyses of place attachment, among the four factors of place attachment (security, familiarity, belongingness, rootedness), there are no factors significantly relating to overall place attachment.

DATA SOURCES: Published literature obtained through PubMed searches and clinical pictures. STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies relevant to the mechanisms, diagnosis, management and potential therapy of AD infectious complications. RESULTS: Skin barrier defects, type 2 inflammation, S. aureus colonization and cutaneous dysbiosis are the major predisposing factors for the increased infections in AD. While overt infections require antibiotics, the use of antibiotics in AD exacerbation remains controversial. CONCLUSION: Infectious complications are a co-morbidity of AD.

Efficacy of Bti is dose-dependent. There is a knowledge gap on the effects of larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses on emerging adult mosquitoes. The present study examined the effect of larval exposure to sublethal doses of Bti on the survival, body size and oviposition rate in adult Anopheles coluzzii. METHODS: Third-instar An. coluzzii larvae were exposed to control and sublethal Bti concentrations at LC(20), LC(50) and LC(70) for 48 h. Surviving larvae were reared to adults under standard colony conditions. Thirty randomly selected females from each treatment were placed in separate cages and allowed to blood feed. Twenty-five gravid females from the blood-feeding cages were randomly selected and transferred into new cages where they were provided with oviposition cups. Numbers of eggs laid in each cage and mortality of all adult mosquitoes were recorded daily. Wing lengths were measured of 570 mosquitoes as a proxy for body size. RESULTS: Exposure to LC(70)Bti doses for 48 h as third-instar larvae reduced longevity of adult An. coluzzii mosquitoes. Time to death was 2.58 times shorter in females exposed to LC(70)Bti when compared to the control females. Estimated mortality hazard rates were also higher in females exposed to the LC(50) and LC(20) treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant. The females exposed to LC(70) concentrations had 12% longer wings than the control group (P < 0.01). No differences in oviposition rate of the gravid females were observed between the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of An. coluzzii larvae to sublethal Bti doses reduces longevity of resultant adults and is associated with larger adult size and unclear effect on oviposition. These findings suggest that anopheline larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses, though not recommended, could reduce vectorial capacity for malaria vector populations by increasing mortality of resultant adults.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. RESULTS: We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (> 9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in the clinic.","output":"Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to accelerate, putting a considerable burden on public health, safety, and the global economy. Taking into consideration that the main route of virus transmission is via respiratory particles, the face mask represents a simple and efficient barrier between potentially infected and healthy individuals, thus reducing transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles. However, long-term usage of a face mask leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of different pathogens and viruses onto the surface of the mask and can result in dangerous bacterial and viral co-infections. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) has recently emerged as an efficient water-stable photocatalyst capable of generating reactive oxygen species under light irradiation destroying dangerous microbial pathogens. The present study investigates the potential of using ZIF-8 as a coating for face masks to prevent the adherence of microbial/viral entities. The results show that after 2 h of UV irradiation, a polypropylene mask coated with ZIF-8 nanostructures is capable of eliminating S. Aureus and bacteriophage MS2 with 99.99% and 95.4% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, low-pathogenic HCoV-OC43 coronavirus was eliminated by a ZIF-8-modified mask with 100% efficiency already after 1 h of UV irradiation. As bacteriophage MS2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus are commonly used surrogates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the revealed antiviral properties of ZIF-8 can represent an important step in designing efficient protective equipment for controlling and fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Modification of face masks with zeolite imidazolate framework-8: A tool for hindering the spread of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Europe, the antimicrobial use (AMU) for food\\\\producing animals has decreased rapidly.

The aim of our study was to explore how Swedish veterinarians describe the relations between (1) being restrictive with antibiotics due to the risk of AMR and (2) concerns for animal welfare and/or the veterinarian\\\\client relationship. METHODS: Semi\\\\structured interviews with 21 veterinarians, working with dairy cattle, were performed. The transcripts were analysed, and a number of dominant patterns which recurred in all, or most of, the interviews were identified. RESULT: The interviewed veterinarians described AMR prevention and tackling the threat AMR poses towards public health, as central for their profession and as influencing their everyday practice and decisions on AMU. Importantly, veterinarians described accounting for AMR in everyday practice as fairly unproblematic, both in relation to animal welfare as well as in relation to farmers. The veterinarians generally perceived that they could treat animals with antibiotics when justified, and being restrictive with antibiotics was described as an expression of professional skill and not as challenging as animal welfare. Moreover, they stated that restrictive AMU seldom or never caused conflicts with farmers.

These approaches assume parameters such as reproduction time, test positivity rate, hospitalization rate, and social intervention effectiveness (masking, distancing, and mobility) are constant. However, the one certainty with the COVID-19 pandemic is that these parameters change over time, as well as vary across counties and states. In fact, the rate of spread over region, hospitalization rate, hospital length of stay and mortality rate, the proportion of the population that is susceptible, test positivity rate, and social behaviors can all change significantly over time. Thus, the quantification of uncertainty becomes critical in making meaningful and accurate forecasts of the future. Bayesian approaches are a natural way to fully represent this uncertainty in mathematical models and have become particularly popular in physics and engineering models. The explicit integration time varying parameters and uncertainty quantification into a hierarchical Bayesian forecast model differentiates the Mayo COVID-19 model from other forecasting models. By accounting for all sources of uncertainty in both parameter estimation as well as future trends with a Bayesian approach, the Mayo COVID-19 model accurately forecasts future cases and hospitalizations, as well as the degree of uncertainty. This approach has been remarkably accurate and a linchpin in Mayo Clinic's response to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The model accurately predicted timing and extent of the summer and fall surges at Mayo Clinic sites, allowing hospital leadership to manage resources effectively to provide a successful pandemic response.

N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP? VICTORY(TM) unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. FINDINGS: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. CONCLUSIONS: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","output":"Decontaminating N95 respirators during the Covid-19 pandemic: simple and practical approaches to increase decontamination capacity, speed, safety and ease of use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a safe procedure with variable outcomes and large standard deviations. LAGB with gastric plication (LAGBP) is a new restrictive procedure that combines the lap band with gastric plication. This procedure, with its mechanism being below the band anatomically, should augment the weaknesses of the lap band: slips and inadequate weight loss. OBJECTIVE Compare the weight loss results and complication rates between the LAGB and LAGBP. SETTING Private practice. METHODS Data was analyzed data from 120 patients retrospectively from 2 surgeons at a single private institution. Seventy-six patients underwent LAGB, and 44 other patients underwent LAGBP between February 2011 and July 2013. All 120 patients are beyond the 1-year postoperative mark and 110 patients are beyond the 2-year postoperative mark. A subset analysis was performed comparing data from both procedures to evaluate weight loss and complications. RESULTS There were no significant differences between preoperative age, weight, and body mass index between the patients who underwent either procedure. We had 47.4% and 52.3% follow-up at 1 year for LAGB and LAGBP, respectively, with 91.5% and 92.3% follow-up at 2 year for LAGB and LAGBP, respectively. Complications were low with LAGBP; however, it was not statistically significant (P = .54). The LAGBP had a greater percent excess weight loss, percent total weight loss, and percent excess body mass index lost compared with the LAGB at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, and these differences were statistically significant. Mean percent excess weight loss for LAGB and LAGBP was 28.3% and 34.5% (P<.05) at 1 year and 32.1% and 39.2% (P<.05) at 2 years, respectively. CONCLUSION LAGBP is a safe, feasible, and reproducible bariatric procedure. The LAGBP performs significantly better than the LAGB for weight loss. The complication and revision rates were slightly higher with LAGB than LAGBP. However, it was not statistically significant.","output":"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with gastric plication: midterm outcomes in terms of weight loss and short term complications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artigo de opini?o com reflex?es sobre o papel da Ateno Primria  Sade (APS) na pandemia de COVID-19 a partir da definio de seus atributos: acesso, longitudinalidade, integralidade, coordenao, orientao familiar, orientao comunitria e competncia cultural Opinion article reflecting on the role of Primary Health Care (PHC) in the COVID-19 pandemic from the definition of its attributes: access, longitudinality, integrality, coordination, family orientation, community orientation and cultural competence Artculo de opinin con reflexiones sobre el papel de la Atencin Primaria de Salud (APS) en la pandemia COVID-19 a partir de la definicin de sus atributos: acceso, longitudinalidad, integralidad, coordinacin, orientacin familiar, orientacin comunitaria y competencia cultural","output":"Reflex?es sobre o papel da Ateno Primria  Sade na pandemia de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the impact of substance use disorder on the risk of hospitalization, complications, and mortality among adult patients diagnosed as having COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether pregnancy is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients of reproductive age hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (April 2020CMay 2021) of 23,574 female inpatients aged 15C45 years with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for COVID-19 discharged from 749 U.S. hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. We used a viral pneumonia diagnosis to select for patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The associations between pregnancy and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation were analyzed using propensity scoreCmatched conditional logistic regression. Models were matched for age, marital status, race and ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidity score, payer, hospital number of beds, season of discharge, hospital region, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, deficiency anemias, depression, hypothyroidism, and liver disease. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality occurred in 1.1% of pregnant patients and 3.5% of nonpregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia (propensity scoreCmatched odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.25C0.63). The frequency of ICU admission for pregnant and nonpregnant patients was 22.0% and 17.7%, respectively (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15C1.55). Mechanical ventilation was used in 8.7% of both pregnant and nonpregnant patients (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86C1.29). Among patients who were admitted to an ICU, mortality was lower for pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20C0.57), though mechanical ventilation rates were similar (35.7% vs 38.3%, OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70C1.16). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, pregnant patients had a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality compared with nonpregnant patients (0.26, 95% CI 0.15C0.46). CONCLUSION: Despite a higher frequency of ICU admission, in-hospital mortality was lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and these findings persisted after propensity score matching.","output":"Pregnancy and the Risk of In-Hospital Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kala-azar is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania species transmitted by sand fly. In Kenya, kala-azar is endemic in thirty sub-counties spread over in eleven counties in the arid zones. Climate change-influenced seasonal weather variability and environmental alterations remain important determinants of many vector-borne diseases. The present study focused on climate change and environmental influence on kala-azar in West Pokot. Descriptive cross-sectional and retrospective research design was adapted. Study area was purposively selected. Locations and villages were randomly selected, while households were systematically selected. Three hundred sixty three household questionnaires, eleven key informant interviews, and five focus group discussions were undertaken. Secondary data was obtained from Kacheliba sub-county hospital records. Statistical package for social science version 24 was used to analyze quantitative data while NVivo software was used to analyse qualitative data. Kala-azar cases have been on the rise on aggregate from 2010 to 2020, 400 to 500 annual average cases, and incident rate tends to surge during dry season and just after the rains when humidity is high and temperature variations are wide. Significant environmental characteristics associated with risk of kala-azar infection included: presences of seasonal rain water pathways and rock piles around houses (X2= 30.706, df=1, p<0.001); presence of acacia trees in and around homesteads (X2=21.404, df=1, p<0.001); presence of dumping site (X2=9.641, df=1, p=0.002); presence of anthills around the homesteads (X2=16.538, df=1, p<0.001); presence of animal shed (X2=4.290, df=1, p=0.038); presences of chicken shelter (X2=36.862, df=1, p<0.001); and practices of frequently moving houses to new temporary compound (X2=20.919, df=1, p<0.001).

RECENT FINDINGS: Globally, the healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis of resources due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and pneumonia are the most common symptoms associated with it. The incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients ranges from 29.1 to 89.9%. Supplemental oxygen therapy is the main stay treatment for managing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a novel non-invasive strategy for better oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients. In this grim scenario, a reduction in mechanical ventilation by means of HFNC is of prime interest SUMMARY: HFNC is considered an aerosol-generating intervention with the risk of viral aerosolization with a concern of potential nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The design of the device resulted from an interdisciplinary approach attempting to mix valuable techniques from User Experience exploratory research, with the typical way of conducting overcrowding investigations in outdoors and wild areas. We began by reframing both nature and overcrowding as experiences and defining overcrowding as a disturbance to the nature experience. This lead to a new idea for a more beneficial investigation of visitor's perception, which is moment-to-moment and in context. The device supports recording someone's subjective perception of overcrowding in space and time, with minimal task load or distraction from the nature experience. The streamlined design affords only two buttons with competing functionalities: one to signal \\"there are too many people at the park\\"and another for \\"the park is too empty\\". The device continuously records time, location, and press-down button events, storing everything locally and anonymously, within the boundaries of European GDPR. We applied our method to a field study at the Tingvellir National Park in Iceland, both a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage. We then analyzed the collected data and visualized where and when the visitors reported overcrowding. Initial results indicate that by complementing traditional questionnaires with moment-to-moment self-reporting, we could successfully estimate the disturbance from overcrowding over time and place, thus producing a deeper insight into the quality of the experience than questionnaires alone. Our results also speak of some intrinsic qualities of the outdoor infrastructure. The outcome has the potential to make park managers, designers, landscape architects and rangers more capable of understanding the complex interrelation between infrastructure and visitor flow, thus contributing towards the goals of a long-term sustainable management of the area. ? 2021 Owner/Author.","output":"Assessing the Disturbance from Overcrowding in Outdoor Nature Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After taking a patients history and physical examination, lung ultrasound can immediately reveal numerous causes and complications in patients suffering from respiratory tract infection and/or dyspnea.

This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices of LPTs relating to influenza A (H7N9). METHODS: Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 306 LPTs were interviewed in Guangzhou by a standardized questionnaire between mid-May to June, 2013. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against H7N9. RESULTS: Only 46.1% of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings, and only 22.9% perceived personally \\"likely/very likely\\" to contract H7N9 infection. Around 60% of the respondents complied with hand-washing and wearing gloves, and only 20% reported wearing face masks. Only 16.3% of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry. Being younger, involving in slaughtering poultry, having longer working hours, less access to H7N9-related information and poorer knowledge, and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices. Comparing with previous studies conducted when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection was first identified in Guangdong, LPTs' perceived susceptibility to novel influenza viruses increased significantly but acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry remained low. CONCLUSIONS: Information on avian influenza provided through multiple communication tools may be necessary to promote knowledge among poultry traders. Familiarity with risk may have led to the lower perceived vulnerability to avian influenza and less protective actions among the LPTs particularly for those involving more risky exposure to live poultry.

Our empirical analysis reveals that firms more affected by the pandemic are more likely to withdraw guidance, consistent with firms unwillingness to publicly commit to targets when facing macroeconomic adversity. The effect is more pronounced for firms facing higher litigation risk and product market competition, which is consistent with these conditions making the firm less willing to publicly commit to targets in the face of adversity. We also provide evidence that firms with greater exposure to the pandemic are likely to take the combined action of withdrawing prior guidance and stopping the issuance of new guidance. Moreover, we find that among firms that withdraw guidance, those whose performance subsequently improves are more likely to reinstate their guidance. Finally, we document that firms with greater exposure to the pandemic mention the pandemic less often during earnings conference calls, suggesting that the unwillingness to disclose information about the pandemic extends beyond quantitative disclosure to qualitative disclosure.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity.

Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","output":"Novel Predictors of COVID-19 Protective Behaviors Among US Adults: Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In this paper, we show the work of the emergency surgical department on the example of a large repurposed multidisciplinary hospital, also its necessity even for infectious hospitals not accepting patients with acute surgical pathology METHODS AND MATERIALS The work of surgical department of Pavlov First Saint Petersburg State Medical University repurposed for COVID-19 patients was analyzed About 1500 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized during 4-month period RESULTS All patients undergoing surgery were in severe condition (at intensive care unit) Most common surgery in abdomen was diagnostic laparoscopy Spontaneous bleedings of different localization occurred in these patients, what required endovascular and endoscopic treatment We observed only Clavien - Dindo 1-degree postoperative complications Mortality rate was high and amounted to 75 % CONCLUSION The work of surgical department in an infectious hospital for the treatment of a new coronavirus infection is extremely difficult An infectious hospital should have a 24-hour diagnostic service (US, CT, MRI) Patients severity and the working conditions necessitate the availability of the trained surgical personnel Given the high risks of bleedings in patients with COVID-19, it is necessary to have a 24-hour endoscopy and endovascular surgery departments with the ability to perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions ? 2020 Grekov's Bulletin of Surgery","output":"Urgent surgical department in multidisciplinary hospital repurposed as infectious hospital for new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS CoV2) infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China which caused an unprecedented pandemic involving at least 185 countries infecting 2.5 million people till date.

However, a lack of epidemiological data remains for this pathology, and the performances of the influenza-like illness (ILI) case definitions used for sentinel surveillance have never been evaluated in Senegal. This study aimed to i) assess the performance of three different ILI case definitions, adopted by the WHO, USA-CDC (CDC) and European-CDC (ECDC) and ii) identify clinical factors associated with a positive diagnosis for Influenza in order to develop an algorithm fitted for the Senegalese context. METHODS: All 657 patients with a febrile pathological episode (FPE) between January 2013 and December 2016 were followed in a cohort study in two rural villages in Senegal, accounting for 1653 FPE observations with nasopharyngeal sampling and influenza virus screening by rRT-PCR. For each FPE, general characteristics and clinical signs presented by patients were collected. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for the three ILI case definitions were assessed using PCR result as the reference test. Associations between clinical signs and influenza infection were analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Sore throat, arthralgia or myalgia were missing for children under 5 years. RESULTS: WHO, CDC and ECDC case definitions had similar sensitivity (81.0%; 95%CI: 77.0C85.0) and NPV (91.0%; 95%CI: 89.0C93.1) while the WHO and CDC ILI case definitions had the highest specificity (52.0%; 95%CI: 49.1C54.5) and PPV (32.0%; 95%CI: 30.0C35.0). These performances varied by age groups. In children < 5 years, the significant predictors of influenza virus infection were cough and nasal discharge. In patients from 5 years, cough, nasal discharge, sore throat and asthenia grade 3 best predicted influenza infection. The addition of nasal discharge as a symptom to the WHO case definition decreased sensitivity but increased specificity, particularly in the pediatric population. CONCLUSION: In summary, all three definitions studies (WHO, ECDC & CDC) have similar performance, even by age group. The revised WHO ILI definition could be chosen for surveillance purposes for its simplicity. Symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection vary according the age group.

While effective vaccines are being administered globally, there is still a great need for antiviral therapies as potentially antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge across the globe. Viruses require host factors at every step in their life cycle, representing a rich pool of candidate targets for antiviral drug design. To identify host factors that promote SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential for broad-spectrum activity across the coronavirus family, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens in two cell lines (Vero E6 and HEK293T ectopically expressing ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold-causing human coronavirus OC43. While we identified multiple genes and functional pathways that have been previously reported to promote human coronavirus replication, we also identified a substantial number of novel genes and pathways. Of note, host factors involved in cell cycle regulation were enriched in our screens as were several key components of the programmed mRNA decay pathway. Finally, we identified novel candidate antiviral compounds targeting a number of factors revealed by our screens.

However, past infection and vaccination may affect an individual's susceptibility to infection. Little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy. Using the United Kingdom as our motivating example, we assess the impact of different childhood vaccination strategies, specifically annual and biennial (every other year), on attack rate and expected number of infections. Methods and Findings: We present a multi-annual, individual-based, stochastic, force of infection model that accounts for individual exposure histories and disease/vaccine dynamics influencing susceptibility. We simulate birth cohorts that experience yearly influenza epidemics and follow them until age 18 to determine attack rates and the number of childhood infections. We perform simulations under baseline conditions, with an assumed vaccination coverage of 44%, to compare annual vaccination to no and biennial vaccination. We relax our baseline assumptions to explore how our model assumptions impact vaccination program performance. At baseline, we observed more than a 50% reduction in the number of infections between the ages 2 and 10 under annual vaccination in children who had been vaccinated at least half the time compared to no vaccination. When averaged over all ages 0-18, the number of infections under annual vaccination was 2.07 (2.06, 2.08) compared to 2.63 (2.62, 2.64) under no vaccination, and 2.38 (2.37, 2.40) under biennial vaccination. When we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures, we observed a decrease in the difference in infections between the vaccination strategies. Specifically, the difference in childhood infections under biennial compared to annual vaccination decreased from 0.31 to 0.04 as exposure penalty increased. Conclusion: Our results indicate that while annual vaccination averts more childhood infections than biennial vaccination, this difference is small. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, even with modest vaccination coverage, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program.","output":"Is annual vaccination best?

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were created: V-group (Vicryl? 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafix? 2/0-Ethicon). Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a nonabsorbable \\"correction\\" (\\"c\\"; in order to close a small hiatus at the anastomosis) or hemostatic (\\"h\\") stitch was made (using a single Prolene? 2/0-Ethicon). RESULTS Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 1:00:44, P = 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter in the S-group (07:41 min versus 08:13 min in the V-group, P = 0.005).

However, the comparability between sites and protocols is unknown. Here, we provide initial experiences on the agreement of hyperpolarized MRI between sites and protocols by repeated imaging of same healthy volunteers in Europe and the US. Methods: Three healthy volunteers traveled for repeated multicenter brain MRI exams with hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate within one year. First, multisite agreement was assessed with the same echo-planar imaging protocol at both sites. Then, this was compared to a variable resolution echo-planar imaging protocol. In total, 12 examinations were performed. Common metrics of (13)C-pyruvate to (13)C-lactate conversion were calculated, including the k(PL), a model-based kinetic rate constant, and its model-free equivalents. Repeatability was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for absolute agreement computed using two-way random effects models. Results: The mean k(PL) across all examinations in the multisite comparison was 0.024  0.0016 s(?1). The ICC of the k(PL) was 0.83 (p = 0.14) between sites and 0.7 (p = 0.09) between examinations of the same volunteer at any of the two sites. For the model-free metrics, the lactate Z-score had similar site-to-site ICC, while it was considerably lower for the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Conclusions: Estimation of metabolic conversion from hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate to lactate using model-based metrics such as k(PL) suggests close agreement between sites and examinations in volunteers.

While standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody, antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective. Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.","output":"Tracking disease outbreaks from sparse data with Bayesian inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 has spread worldwide and become an international pandemic.

This study aimed to evaluate if and how child and adolescent psychiatric visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) changed during the pandemic lockdown, which started in Italy on February 24, 2020. METHODS We examined all ED visits by patients under 18 years of age in the 7 weeks prior to February 24, 2020, and in the subsequent 8 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown at two urban university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy. ED visits during the corresponding periods of 2019 served as a comparison using Poisson regression modeling. The clinician's decision to hospitalize or discharge home the patient after the ED visit was examined as an index of clinical severity. RESULTS During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 72.0% decrease in the number of all pediatric ED visits (3,395) compared with the corresponding period in 2019 (12,128), with a 46.2% decrease in psychiatric visits (50 vs 93).

The aim of this study is to differentiate between CIP and RP by pretreatment CT radiomics and clinical or radiological parameters. METHODS: A total of 126 advance-stage NSCLC patients with pneumonitis were enrolled in this retrospective study and divided into the training dataset (n =88) and the validation dataset (n = 38). A total of 837 radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest based on the lung parenchyma window of CT images. A radiomics signature was constructed on the basis of the predictive features by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. A logistic regression was applied to develop a radiomics nomogram. Receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the curve (AUC) were applied to evaluate the performance of pneumonitis etiology identification. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the training and the validation datasets for any clinicopathological parameters in this study. The radiomics signature, named Rad-score, consisting of 11 selected radiomics features, has potential ability to differentiate between CIP and RP with the empirical and -binormal-based AUCs of 0.891 and 0.896. These results were verified in the validation dataset with AUC = 0.901 and 0.874, respectively. The clinical and radiological parameters of bilateral changes (p < 0.001) and sharp border (p = 0.001) were associated with the identification of CIP and RP. The nomogram model showed good performance on discrimination in the training dataset (AUC = 0.953 and 0.950) and in the validation dataset (AUC = 0.947 and 0.936). CONCLUSIONS: CT-based radiomics features have potential values for differentiating between patients with CIP and patients with RP. The addition of bilateral changes and sharp border produced superior model performance on classifying, which could be a useful method to improve related clinical decision-making.","output":"Development and Validation of a Radiomics Nomogram Using Computed Tomography for Differentiating Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Related Pneumonitis From Radiation Pneumonitis for Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Impact of the Delta variant and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among contacts. Relative risk ratios and bootstrapping at the cluster level was used to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants and vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19. Logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease FINDINGS: Of 1024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases, 753 (73.5%) were linked to Delta-infected indexes and 248 (24.2%) were exposed to indexes with other variants. Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval [BCI] 20.6C31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0C20.0%) among other variant-exposed contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24C3.84). Among Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6C75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8C85.4%) against symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33, 95% robust confidence interval [RCI] 0.17C0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03C1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38C1.40). INTERPRETATION: Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed two probabilistic state-transition (Markov) microsimulation models to compare fetal genotyping followed by targeted management versus usual care (i.e., universal Rh immunoglobulin [RhIG] prophylaxis in nonalloimmunized RhD-negative pregnancies, or universal intensive monitoring in alloimmunized pregnancies). The reference case considered a healthcare payer perspective and a 10-year time horizon. Sensitivity analysis examined assumptions related to test cost, paternal screening, subsequent pregnancies, other alloantibodies (e.g., K, Rh c/C/E), societal perspective, and lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Fetal genotyping in nonalloimmunized pregnancies (at per-sample test cost of C$247/US$311) was associated with a slightly higher probability of maternal alloimmunization (22 vs. 21 per 10,000) and a reduced number of RhIG injections (1.427 vs. 1.795) than usual care. It was more expensive (C$154/US$194, 95% Credible Interval [CrI]: C$139/US$175-C$169/US$213) and had little impact on QALYs (0.0007, 95%CrI: -0.01-0.01). These results were sensitive to the test cost (threshold achieved at C$88/US$111), and inclusion of paternal screening. Fetal genotyping in alloimmunized pregnancies (at test cost of C$328/US$413) was less expensive (-C$6280/US$7903, 95% CrI: -C$6325/US$7959 to -C$6229/US$7838) and more effective (0.19 QALYs, 95% CrI 0.17-0.20) than usual care. These cost savings remained robust in sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: Noninvasive fetal RhD genotyping saves resources and represents good value for the management of alloimmunized pregnancies. If the cost of genotyping is substantially decreased, the targeted intervention can become a viable option for nonalloimmunized pregnancies.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of noninvasive fetal RhD blood group genotyping in nonalloimmunized and alloimmunized pregnancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our rituals for training, supervision and competence assessment which once relied on in\\\\person interaction are rapidly becoming influenced by the digital creativity which surrounds them Our training models have to be diverse and considerate of the multiple contextual shifts with which systemic practitioners are contending, and the current context is complex for student, supervisor and families alike The aim of this paper is to consider how digital practices might reshape our systemic training, supervision and competence evaluation, considering issues for student and trainer as they move to digital delivery of training and supervision This paper explores the historical context of online learning, enhancing online presence, and the ethical and practical implications of teaching and supervising digitally It concludes with a discussion about how competence frameworks are influenced by the shift to digital practice and suggests digital skills required for systemic practice going forward Practitioner Points: Consider how digital practices might reshape your systemic training delivery, with attention to enhancing online presence Pay particular consideration in live supervision to trainee's skills in attentiveness and attunement to family and couple interactions and emotional responses Consider the differing processes of competence evaluation online and the need to attend to specific digital skills (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Resumen: Nuestros rituales de formacin, supervisin y evaluacin de competencias, que antes dependan de la interaccin en persona, estn siendo rpidamente influenciados por la creatividad digital que los rodea Nuestros modelos de formacin tienen que ser diversos y tener en cuenta los mltiples cambios contextuales con los que se enfrentan los profesionales sistmicos y el contexto actual es complejo para el estudiante, el supervisor y las familias por igual El objetivo de este artculo es considerar cmo las prcticas digitales podran remodelar nuestra formacin sistmica, supervisin y evaluacin de competencias, considerando problemas para estudiantes y formadores a medida que avanzan hacia la integracin digital en capacitacin y supervisin Este artculo explora el contexto histrico del aprendizaje on\\\\line, mejorando la presencia on\\\\line y las implicaciones ticas y prcticas de ense?ar y supervisar digitalmente Concluye con una discusin sobre cmo los marcos de competencias se ven influenciados por el cambio a la prctica digital y sugiere las habilidades digitales necesarias para la prctica sistmica en el futuro Puntos de implicacin prctica: Considere cmo las prcticas digitales podran remodelar su capacitacin sistmica, prestando atencin a mejorar la presencia on\\\\line Preste especial atencin en la supervisin en vivo a las habilidades del alumno en cuanto a atencin y sintona con las interacciones familiares y de pareja y las respuestas emocionales Considere los diferentes procesos de evaluacin de competencias on\\\\line y la necesidad de atender a habilidades digitales especficas (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] ժҪ: ǵѵʽ滥Ѹ֮ܵصִµӰ졣ǵѵģʽǵϵͳҵŬӦԵĶı仯ǰıѧͼͥһӵġĵĿǿֻʵϵͳѵ˼ѧѵתֻѵͶʱٵ⡣̽ѧϰʷǿϲ룬ԼֻѧͶʵ塣ֻʵתܵӰ죬ϵͳʵֻܡ Դҵߵʾ: ֻʵϵͳѵעǿϲ롣϶Уرעѵ߶Լͥͷ޻ԼӦĹע͵гĲͬԼעضּܵҪ (Chinese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Family Therapy is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The journey towards digital systemic competence: Thoughts on training, supervision and competence evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multi-system infection with emerging evidence-based antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies to improve disease prognosis. However, a subset of patients with COVID-19 signs and symptoms have repeatedly negative RT-PCR tests, leading to treatment hesitancy. We used comparative serology early in the COVID-19 pandemic when background seroprevalence was low to estimate the likelihood of COVID-19 infection among RT-PCR negative patients with clinical signs and/or symptoms compatible with COVID-19. METHODS: Between April and October 2020, we conducted serologic testing of patients with (i) signs and symptoms of COVID-19 who were repeatedly negative by RT-PCR (Probables; N = 20), (ii) signs and symptoms of COVID-19 but with a potential alternative diagnosis (Suspects; N = 15), (iii) no signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (Non-suspects; N = 43), (iv) RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients (N = 40), and (v) pre-pandemic samples (N = 55). RESULTS: Probables had similar seropositivity and levels of IgG and IgM antibodies as propensity-score matched RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients (60.0% vs 80.0% for IgG, p-value = 0.13; 50.0% vs 72.5% for IgM, p-value = 0.10), but multi-fold higher seropositivity rates than Suspects and matched Non-suspects (60.0% vs 13.3% and 11.6% for IgG; 50.0% vs 0% and 4.7% for IgM respectively; p-values < 0.01). However, Probables were half as likely to receive COVID-19 treatment than the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with similar disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate a high likelihood of acute COVID-19 among RT-PCR negative with typical signs/symptoms, but a common omission of COVID-19 therapies among these patients. Clinically diagnosed COVID-19, independent of RT-PCR positivity, thus has a potential vital role in guiding treatment decisions.

Materials and methods: 166 patients with COVID-19 infection were included in an open prospective clinical study. The study group (group I) was 118 patients, average age 57.5 [47;64] years with overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) - 31.2 [28.6;34.9] kg/m2). The comparison group (II) was 48 patients (mean age 53 [41;62] years) with normal body weight (BMI 23.9 [22.6;24.6] kg/m2). Clinical-functional, laboratory indicators, data from instrumental research methods were studied. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of the chest organs. Results: Overweight and obese patients with COVID-19 (n = 118) showed a more significant increase in hepatic transaminases compared to the control group: ALT level was 28.05 [17.9;45] vs 17,9 [13,6;24.7] U/L (reference interval < 35U/L), p = 0.000001, ACT - 32 [24;43,5] vs 24 [19;28.9] U/l, p = 0.000019.

Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected at URI onset and when acute otitis media was diagnosed; virus studies were performed using conventional diagnostics and PCR. Repeated presence of adenovirus by PCR was further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS Of 581 URI episodes in 76 children, 510 viruses were detected. Of the viruses detected by PCR, 15% were those detected previously; repeated positives occurred most frequently with adenovirus. Sequencing results were available in 13 children with repeated adenovirus detection; the following 4 patterns of infection were identified (16 instances): (1) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected continuously (n = 8 instances), (2) adenovirus of different serotypes detected during sequential URI episodes (n = 3), (3) adenovirus of the same serotype but different strains detected during sequential URI episodes (n = 3), and (4) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected intermittently (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS Among children with frequent URIs, repeated positive PCR results for adenovirus NA may represent a new serotype/strain, or persistence of viral NA. Results must be interpreted with caution; clinical correlation and presence of other viruses are important. Further longitudinal studies of children during and after infection are required for better understanding of the clinical significance of positive PCR tests for adenovirus NA in the respiratory tract.","output":"Persistence of adenovirus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions: a diagnostic conundrum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current Covid-19 pandemic has affected health workers, some estimates mention more than 90,000 affected, even with deaths throughout the world. Population characteristics [Image: see text] General symptoms [Image: see text] METHODS: Descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional study. The cases of front-line doctors infected with Covid-19 during a hospitalary outbreak, in the General Hospital 71 Lic. Benito Coquet Lagunes of Veracruz, dependent on the Mexican Institute of Social Security, from April 1 to May 31, 2020. Treatments [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: Seven doctors were entered into the study, with an average age of 42.4 years, all of them male. The affectation by service was: Internal medicine 5 of 17 doctors (29.4%), Emergencies 1 of 15 doctors (6.6%) and Intensive care 1 of 6 doctors (16.6%) infected by Covid-19. Laboratory studies were only performed in 5 cases, the presence of leukopenia in 1 case (20%), leukocytosis in 2 cases (40%), lymphopenia in 4 cases (80%) stand out. Impaired fasting glucose was reported in all cases. There was no alteration in kidney function; in liver function, transaminemia was reported in 80%. Regarding the acute phase reactants, the intake of these was very inconsistent since it was not uniform in all cases, but the most representative was elevated ESR in 4 of 4 cases (100%), positive PCR in 3 of 4 cases (75%), procalcitonin negative in 3 of 3 cases (100%), elevated DHL in 2 of 5 cases (40%), elevated D-dimer in 1 of 3 cases (33.3%), elevated ferritinemia in 1 of 2 cases (50 %).

For the first time, we studied the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against A/H7N9 of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs), which were delivered into the cells in the proposed TiO2-based nanocomposites (TiO2ODN). The highest inhibition of A/H7N9 in vitro (400-fold) and efficient, sequence-specific, and dose-dependent protection (up to 100%) of A/H7N9-infected mice was revealed when ODN was targeted to the conserved terminal 3'-noncoding region of viral (-)RNA. After the treatment with ODN, the virus titer values in the lungs of mice decreased by several orders of magnitude. The TiO2ODN nanocomposite did not show toxicity in mice under the treatment conditions.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study examining the feasibility and impact of virtual care as an adjunct to in-person emergency care at a tertiary pediatric hospital from May to July 2020. Children (< 18 years) from Ontario and Quebec seeking V-PED care were included. A secure, encrypted, video platform within the hospitals electronic medical record was used. Caregivers self-determined appropriateness of V-PED using a standardized online triage questionnaire to request their appointment. The V-PED is directly launched from the patients chart and the family joins the portal via hyperlink. Outcome measures included the number of V-PED visits, hospital admission rates, and caregiver satisfaction using a 10-item voluntary post-visit online survey. RESULTS: A total of 1036 V-PED visits were seen of which 176 (17.0%) were referred for further in-person ED assessment, and 8 (0.8%) required hospital admission. Of the 107 completing patient experience surveys (10% response), most respondents (69%) endorsed they very likely or definitely would have presented in-person to the ED if V-PED were unavailable. Overall satisfaction was rated as excellent (9 or 10 out of 10) in 87% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Our novel V-PED is feasible, has high caregiver satisfaction, and can reduce the burden of in-person ED visits. Future work must ensure the safety of emergency virtual care and examine how to increase capacity and integrate V-PED within traditional emergency medicine.

We quantified the observed vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection (VEi) and hospitalization (VEh). Exhaustive data on testing and vaccination was combined with a clinical hospital survey. We estimated VEi using a test negative design and VEh using a proportional hazard analysis. We controlled for prior infection, age, sex, province of residence and calendar week of sampling. Variant of concern specific VE-estimates were obtained by time since vaccination from July 2021 to April 2022. We included 1,433,135 persons. VEi against Delta waned from an initial estimate of 81% (95%CI 80-82) to 56% (95%CI 56-57) 100-150 days after primary-vaccination. Booster-vaccination increased initial VEi to 84% (95%CI 83-85). Against Omicron, an initial VEi of 37% (95%CI 34-40) waned to 18% (95%CI 17-20) 100-150 days after primary-vaccination. Booster-vaccination increased VEi to 52% (95%CI 51-53) and waned to 25% (95%CI 24-27) 100-150 days after vaccination. Hybrid immunity conferred by prior infection and booster-vaccination outperformed booster-vaccination only even if the infection was over one year ago, 67% (95%CI 66-68). Initial VEh for booster-vaccination decreased from 93% (95%CI 93-94) against Delta to 87% (95%CI 85-89) against Omicron. VEh for Omicron waned to 66% (95%CI 63-70) 100-150 days after booster-vaccination. In conclusion, we report significant immune-escape by Omicron. VEh was less affected than VEi and immune-escape was attenuated by booster-vaccination. Waning further reduced VEi- and VEh-estimates.

An Indiana neuro\\\\behavioral health practice (Vanguard Eldercare Medical Group), providing on\\\\site care at greater than 200 SNF\\\\LTCs, measured the change in incoming urgent/emergent patient care phone requests during April as a potential proxy for a negative change in SNF\\\\LTC resident neuro\\\\psychiatric status. METHOD: Urgent/emergent incoming behavioral health phone requests were compiled from January 1, 2020 until May 17, 2020 on a weekly basis. Incoming calls during regular business hours (BH) (M\\\\F 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and after\\\\hours (AH) were measured from the medical groups telephone monitoring system and EMR. These were analyzed using one\\\\tailed t\\\\tests to determine if the onset of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic (declared 3/11/2020) increased the number of incoming calls after accounting for the number of patients. RESULT: In Figure 1, the number of BH calls appears to increase in the end of March, while AH calls appear to decline. Table 1 shows the mean number of BH calls per week prior to 3/9/2020 increases from 41.44 to 69.03 (p=0.0014). After hours calls decreased from 17.33 to 9.8 (p=0.00056) and the number of patients served increased from 7618.33 to 7767.90 (p=0.0073). To adjust for the increasing patient population, we calculated the mean number of calls per week per 1000 residents. BH calls per 1000 patients increased from 5.44 to 8.67 (p=0.0018) and AH calls per 1000 patients decreased from 2.28 to 1.26 (p=0.00052). CONCLUSION: It was anticipated that increased stressors would negatively impact these residents mental health. The significant increase in behavioral health phone requests suggests confirmation of this hypothesis. The disparity between business hours and after\\\\hours phone calls may be due to heightened SNF\\\\LTC staff awareness and/or change in the nature/severity of behavioral health decompensation.","output":"Urgent behavioral health phone calls from skilled nursing and long\\\\term care facilities during COVID\\\\19 lockdown: Developing topics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preponderance of HIV interventions have been behavioral, targeting individual, dyadic, or group dynamics.

Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read and Nanopore long-read poly(A) RNA sequencing in two cell types at multiple time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we identified hundreds of template switches and constructed the dynamic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes. Interestingly, template switching could occur in a bidirectional manner, with diverse SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes generated from successive template-switching events. The majority of template switches result from RNA-RNA interactions, including seed and compensatory modes, with terminal pairing status as a key determinant. Two TRS-independent template switch modes are also responsible for subgenome biogenesis.

To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism. METHODS: In this case series, patients with a positive antemortem or post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 result were considered eligible for enrolment. Post-mortem examinations were done on 14 people who died with COVID-19 at the King County Medical Examiner's Office (Seattle, WA, USA) and Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office (Everett, WA, USA) in negative-pressure isolation suites during February and March, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR. FINDINGS: The median age of our cohort was 735 years (range 42C84; IQR 675C7725). All patients had clinically significant comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute or organising phases, with five patients showing focal pulmonary microthrombi. Coronavirus-like particles were detected in the respiratory system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Lymphocytic myocarditis was observed in one patient with viral RNA detected in the tissue.

The aim of this research was to develop a new method to estimate the glenohumeral CoR and register the location to the body using a single camera and two printed markers. METHODS: During shoulder anteflexion, the arm roughly describes an arc in the sagittal plane, with the glenohumeral joint in the center. Two binary square-fiducial ArUco markers were secured to the upper arm and the scapula, their position and orientation were obtained, and a sphere was fitted to the coordinates of the arm marker. The sphere center position was then registered on the skin. The accuracy was assessed with a test bench with a known rotational center. The repeatability was assessed in vivo with five healthy participants. RESULTS: The mean absolute offset between the true CoR of the test bench and the fitted sphere centers across multiple trials was 2.7 mm at a velocity of 30 degrees/s, and 2.5 mm at 60 degrees/s. The root mean squared distance from the estimated sphere centers after each trial to the mean sphere center across all trials per participant was 5.1 mm on average for the novice examiner and 5.2 mm for the expert examiner.

Much of this is concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas where urban development spreads into hazard-prone areas. Often, this development is dominated by poor-quality homes in informal settlements or slums with poor tenure security. Lessons from a resilience-building project in the Pacific shows that a fit-for-purpose (FFP) approach to land administration can provide solutions by increasing the number of households with security of tenure, and consequently, improving resilience outcomes as informal settlements grow. This paper specifically discusses the influence of FFP land administration on reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks, such as climate change and COVID-19. It proposes ways to be better manage urban growth through the responsible governance of land tenure rights and more effective land-use planning to improve resilience to multiple shocks and stresses, hence, delivering improved access to safe land and shelter. Land administration systems can contribute to enhanced resilience to the shocks of climate extremes and pandemics by improving tenure security and enhancing land-use planning controls. It is argued that climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction need to be better mainstreamed into two major elements of land governance: (i) securing and safeguarding of land rights, and (ii) planning and control of land use.","output":"The Benefits of Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration for Urban Community Resilience in a Time of Climate Change and COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals infected with HIV display varying rates of viral control and disease progression, with a small percentage of individuals being able to spontaneously control infection in the absence of treatment. In attempting to define the correlates associated with natural protection against HIV, extreme heterogeneity in the datasets generated from systems methodologies can be further complicated by the inherent variability encountered at the population, individual, cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, such studies have been limited by the paucity of well-characterised samples and linked epidemiological data, including duration of infection and clinical outcomes. To address this, we selected 10 volunteers who rapidly and persistently controlled HIV, and 10 volunteers each, from two control groups who failed to control (based on set point viral loads) from an acute and early HIV prospective cohort from East and Southern Africa. A propensity score matching approach was applied to control for the influence of five factors (age, risk group, virus subtype, gender, and country) known to influence disease progression on causal observations. Fifty-two plasma proteins were assessed at two timepoints in the 1st year of infection. We independently confirmed factors known to influence disease progression such as the B(*)57 HLA Class I allele, and infecting virus Subtype.

The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality at 1-year. Secondary endpoints included cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, permanent pacemaker implantation, endocarditis, and re-hospitalization for all causes. (3) Results: At baseline, 23 (8.7%) patients were in Stage 0/1 (no cardiac damage/left ventricular damage), 106 (40.4%) in Stage 2 (left atrial or mitral valve damage), 59 (22.5%) in Stage 3 (pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid valve damage) and 74 (28.3%) in Stage 4 (right ventricular damage). At 30-days after TAVI, a lower prevalence of advanced stages of cardiac damage than baseline, mainly driven by a significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic parameters and right ventricular function, was reported.

Verity of viral infections can infect the nervous system; these viral infections can present a wide range of manifestation. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms. For that we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of four online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. All relevant articles that reported psychiatric/psychological symptoms or disorders in COVID-19 without considering time and language restrictions were assessed. All the study procedures were performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Due to the screening, 14 studies were included. The current study result indicated that, the pooled prevalence of CNS or mental associated disorders with 95% CI was 50.68% (6.68-93.88). The most prevalence symptoms were hyposmia/anosmia/olfactory dysfunction (number of study: 10) with 36.20% (14.99-60.51). Only one study reported numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia. Pooled prevalence of numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia was 5.83% (2.17-12.25) and 2.39% (10.75-14.22). The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 3.52% (2.62-4.54) and 13.92% (9.44-19.08). Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has a certain relation with neurological symptoms. The hypsomia, anosmia or olfactory dysfunction was most frequent symptom. Other symptoms were headache or dizziness, dysgeusia or ageusia, dysphonia and fatigue. Depression, anxiety, and confusion were less frequent symptoms.","output":"COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining previous infecting dengue virus (DENV) serotypes has been difficult due to highly cross-reactive immune responses from previous DENV infections. Determining the correlates of serotype-specific immune responses would be crucial in understanding dengue transmission in the community and would also help to determine the correlates of protective immune responses. Therefore, we set out to define highly conserved, serotype-specific regions of the DENVs. Serotype-specific and highly conserved regions of the four DENV serotypes were identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches and custom perl scripts. Using ex-vivo and cultured enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, we identified serotype-specific T cell epitopes within the four DENV serotypes in healthy adult donors from Sri Lanka. We identified T cell responses to 19 regions of the four DENV serotypes. Six peptides were from the NS2A region and four peptides were from the NS4A region. All immune donors responded to peptides of at least two DENV serotypes, suggesting that heterologous infection is common in Sri Lanka. Eight of 20 individuals responded to at least two peptides of DENV-4, despite this serotype not being implicated previously in any of the epidemics in Sri Lanka. The use of these regions to determine past and current infecting DENV serotypes will be of value to characterize further the dynamics of silent dengue transmission in the community. In addition, these T cell responses to these regions could be used to characterize DENV serotype-specific immune responses and thus possibly help us to understand the immune correlates of a protective immune response.","output":"Identification of serotype-specific T cell responses to highly conserved regions of the dengue viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns have been raised about weakening social cohesion in French society against the backdrop of economic slowdown over the last decade. To understand how economic conditions are associated with social cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008C2018) show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes. Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and social order.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. All undergraduate medical students were requested to voluntarily respond to an electronic survey. Demographic data, related factors of happiness and stress, scores from the Thai version of the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (Thai-OHQ), and Thai Stress Questionnaire (Thai-ST5) were collected. RESULTS: There were 369 responses, 64.8% from preclinical students and 35.2% responses from clinical students, and 53.9% were women. The mean age of the participants was 20.621.81 years. The most frequent platforms that the students used to track COVID-19 information were Facebook 43.9% and Twitter 43.4%. Both groups had a low level of stress.

Extrapulmonary dissemination usually affects the skin, bone, genitourinary tract, and central nervous system, and results from hematogenous spread in up to 40% of cases. Rarely, blastomycosis can involve the upper airways and is presumed to result from direct inoculation of the mucosa via inhalation. We report a case of disseminated blastomycosis in a patient presenting with hoarseness and odynophagia due to laryngeal infection, the most common site of head and neck involvement. Case Presentation: A 74-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of hoarseness and odynophagia. This was associated with a 20-pound weight loss due to anorexia. Medical comorbidities were significant for diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis, and ESRD, status post kidney transplant (8 years prior to presentation), on immunosuppression therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, and tacrolimus. Physical exam was remarkable for tenderness on palpation of the left side of the neck and crusted nodules on the left thigh and palm. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and hypercalcemia. Chest roentgenogram showed pulmonary interstitial prominence without focal consolidations. Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus group A PCRs were negative. CT scan of the neck revealed asymmetric soft tissue fullness near the laryngeal vestibule. CT scan of the chest revealed extensive milliary pattern of lung nodules and diffuse interstitial and groundglass opacities. Laryngoscopy demonstrated a mass arising from the left arytenoid and aryepiglottic fold. Biopsies revealed necrotizing acute inflammation with numerous uniform large yeast with broad-based budding, double contour wall and visible nuclei, consistent with Blastomyces. MRI of the brain was negative for involvement. Prior to the biopsies, diagnostic workup was notable for negative serum (1, 3) beta-D-glucan, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, Cryptococcus antigen, and blastomyces and Histoplasma antibodies by immunodiffusion. Sputum samples were negative although the fungal cultures grew filamentous fungus. Histoplasma urine antigen was positive. The patient was initiated on liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole with plan to convert to itraconazole monotherapy to complete a 12 month course. Discussion: Blastomycosis is an uncommon disease caused by the inhalation of the conidia of Blastomyces dermatitidis or Blastomyces gilchristii. Extrapulmonary dissemination is more common in immunocompromised patients with increased risk for severe pulmonary disease, including respiratory failure and ARDS, and a higher mortality rate. Lifelong suppressive antifungal therapy is generally not required following appropriately treated blastomycosis.","output":"An unusual case of disseminated blastomycosis presenting with hoarseness and odynophagia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability and increased thrombotic risk in critically ill patients. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02). There were no differences in major bleeding (p=0.69) or overt thrombosis (p=0.82) between aspirin users and non-aspirin users. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin use may be associated with improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial is needed to assess whether a causal relationship exists between aspirin use and reduced lung injury and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Aspirin Use Is Associated With Decreased Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit Admission, and In-Hospital Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Superimposed multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) co-infection can be associated with worse outcomes in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even if these patients were managed with strict airborne and contact precautions. Identifying risk factors for isolation of MDROs is critical to COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: All eligible adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 10 hospitals in the Republic of Korea between February 2020 and May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Using this cohort, epidemiology and risk factors for isolation of MDROs were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 47 with microbial culture results were included. Twenty isolates of MDROs from 13 (28%) patients were cultured. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (five isolates) was the most common MDRO, followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (four isolates). MDROs were mostly isolated from sputum samples (80%, 16/20). The median time from hospitalization to MDRO isolation was 28 days (interquartile range, 18C38 days). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with MDRO isolation (62% versus 15%; p = 0.001). Use of systemic corticosteroids after diagnosis of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 15.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.34C97.01; p = 0.004) and long-term care facility (LTCF) stay before diagnosis of COVID-19 (aOR: 6.09; 95% CI: 1.02C36.49; p = 0.048) were associated with MDRO isolation. CONCLUSIONS: MDROs were isolated from 28% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with culture data and 8.6% of the entire cohort. Previous LTCF stay and adjunctive corticosteroid use were risk factors for the isolation of MDROs.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","output":"Epigenetic Evolution of ACE2 and IL-6 Genes as Non-Canonical Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlate to COVID-19 Susceptibility in Vertebrates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 2020 Europe has faced the COVID-19 epidemic General confinement measures imposed by governments have had a strong impact on cultural practices, including within dance schools This article describes the actions implemented by the Dance Department of the Lyon National Conservatory of Music and Dance (CNSMDL, France) in order to ensure pedagogical continuity during the confinement period The study focused on the 12 preparatory-year students in contemporary dance Despite numerous constraints-primarily small workspaces, unstable Internet connections, and the difficulty of correcting technical dance moves at a distance-all students and teachers were able to maintain pedagogical follow-up through a series of constructed activities Students appreciated the social aspect (the relationship with their teachers and fellow students) and day-structuring component of the scheduling The online activities helped to avoid student isolation, and motivation seemed unaffected While online exercises can never replace \\"in the flesh\\" dance classes, this crisis provided an opportunity to develop pedagogical innovations and tools that could be reused in face-to-face dance instruction in other contexts such as injuries and intermittent work conditions","output":"Curriculum Development, Implementation, and Evaluation During the COVID-19 Confinement Period in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Front-line workers (FLW) are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and related psychiatric sequelae: depression, anxiety, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep and substance use disorders.

The benefits of minimally invasive surgery include rapid recovery. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of different resection margin lengths from the pylorus in LSG. METHODS This retrospective study included 152 patients who underwent LSG from January 2011 to October 2014. The antrum was resected 2 cm from the pylorus in 84 patients (group A) and 6 cm from the pylorus in 68 patients (group B). The patients' demographics, staple line distance, complications, sex, age, body mass index loss, length of hospital stay, and comorbidities were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The patients comprised 104 women (68.4 %) and 48 men (32.6 %) with a mean age of 41.2 years (range, 28-53 years). The percent total and excess weight loss were statistically significant in both groups at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.

The imaging is based on active glucose utilization by inflammatory tissue. Autoradiography studies have demonstrated high FDG uptake in macrophages, granulocytes, fibroblasts, and granulation tissue. Especially, activated macrophages are responsible for the elevated FDG uptake in some types of inflammation. According to one study, after activation by lipopolysaccharide of cultured macrophages, the [(14)C]2DG uptake by the cells doubled, reaching the level seen in glioblastoma cells. In activated macrophages, increase in the expression of total GLUT1 and redistributions from the intracellular compartments toward the cell surface have been reported. In one rheumatoid arthritis model, following stimulation by hypoxia or TNF-, the highest elevation of the [(3)H]FDG uptake was observed in the fibroblasts, followed by that in macrophages and neutrophils.

Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chiles incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2(nd), 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7(th), 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to maintain the epidemic under control.","output":"Transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in Chile, March-October, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described and highly contagious respiratory infection.

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in 259 critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit admission between March and December 2020. We compared the mortality rate between patients with and without elevated D-dimer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Fagans nomogram, and dose-response relationship were performed to determine the association between D-dimer level and mortality. Results: Overall mortality rate was 40.9% (106 patients). Median D-dimer level was higher in non-survivor group (10,170 ng/mL vs 4,050 ng/mL, p=0.028). The association remained significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis (p=0.046).

Abstract Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of MS, to more than twice, in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of MS. Methods The research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and MS. Our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. The keywords (MeSH terms) employed for the digital search were: virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, and multiple sclerosis. Articles published in English indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study. Results Epidemiological studies suggest that MS has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease. Particularly, viral infections and demyelination events in the CNS may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) through the bloodstream to the CNS, specifically. On the other hand, chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in MS. Conclusions This study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of MS. More epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset, development and severity of the disease.","output":"Papel de las enfermedades infecciosas en el desarrollo de la esclerosis mltiple: evidencia cientfica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is an urgent challenge amplified by socioeconomic factors that demands thoughtful public health responses from OEM professionals.

Therefore, an automated detection system should be implemented as the fastest way of diagnostic option to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short -term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 421 X -ray images including 141 images of COVID-19 is used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system has achieved 97% accuracy, 91% specificity, and 100% sensitivity. The system achieved desired results on a small dataset which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available.

Blood inflammation parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of age and gender (p = 0.147 and p = 0.504, respectively). Nor was there a difference with respect to smokers between the two groups (p = 0.231).

However, it often suffers two major difficulties in real-world applications: 1) only limited labels are available for model training, due to expensive annotation costs over medical images; 2) labeled images may contain considerable label noise (e.g., mislabeling labels) due to diagnostic difficulties of diseases. To address these, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation} (UDA). Unlike most UDA methods that rely on clean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we innovatively propose a Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm, which conducts transferability-aware adaptation and conquers label noise in a collaborative way.

METHODS This cohort study was a retrospective review of patients who underwent laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernial repair from April 4, 2010, through July 22, 2014. Data assessed were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hernia repair indications, hernia type, pain, paresthesia, occurrence (bilateral or unilateral), recurrence, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. RESULTS Six hundred forty patients underwent laparoscopic preperitoneal hernia surgery with self-adhesive mesh. The average age was 56 years, nearly all were men (95.8%), and the mean BMI was 26.2 kg/m(2). Cases involved primary hernia more frequently than recurrent hernia (94% vs 6%; P < .05). After surgery, 92% of the patients reported no more than minimal pain, <1% reported paresthesia, and 0.2% had early recurrence. There were 7 conversions to an open procedure.

In contrast, distinct CPE by conventional microscopy was evident only at ~72 hpi at the corresponding multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A parameter that describes the kinetics of cytopathogenesis, CIT(50), which refers to the time taken for 50% reduction in impedance signal response, revealed an inverse linear relationship with virus titer and MOI. CIT(50) values were also delayed by 31.5 h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, based on the analysis of CIT(50), the virus titer of a given sample can be determined from the measured impedance signal response. Furthermore, consistent impedance results were also obtained with clinical isolates of the four DENV serotypes verified by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing.

The study applies the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) to identify the factors that predict intention to use E-learning. Also, the study examines the effect of personal innovativeness in information technology and perceived financial cost on intention to use E-learning. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a cross-sectional quantitative study design involving 617 university students. The data was collected through an online survey due to the COVID-19 restrictions. The proposed hypotheses were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: The study found that personal innovativeness in information technology, perceived financial cost, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation and social influence have a significant effect on the intention to use E-learning. Contrary to expectation, habits, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions did not predict intention to use E-learning. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted on university students and did not include other school-going students and working professionals. Also, the study sample was not drawn from many universities. The study used a quantitative approach. The use of a mixed-methods approach could provide deeper insights into the factors affecting the intention to use E-learning in developing countries. Practical implications: The practical implications inform policymakers and educational institutions on how E-learning adoption can be enhanced. In this context, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, personal innovativeness and perceived financial cost are identified as predictors of intention to use E-learning. This study has implications for the development of E-learning systems and the promotion of the use of E-learning in the context of developing countries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMeds curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV?2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV?2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV?2 in tissue.

ResultsStaff-to-staff transmission was estimated to be the most frequent transmission type during Wave 1 (31.6% of observed hospital-acquired infections; 95% CI 26.9 to 35.8%), decreasing to 12.9% (95% CI 9.5 to 15.9%) in Wave 2. Patient-to-patient transmissions increased from 27.1% in Wave 1 (95% CI 23.3 to 31.4%) to 52.1% (95% CI 48.0 to 57.1%) in Wave 2, to become the predominant transmission type. Over 50% of hospital-acquired infections were concentrated in 8/120 locations in Wave 1 and 10/93 locations in Wave 2. Approximately 40% to 50% of hospital-onset patient cases resulted in onward transmission compared to less than 4% of definite community-acquired cases.

As hospital-acquired cases appeared to drive most onward transmissions, more frequent and rapid identification and isolation of these cases will be required to break hospital transmission chains in subsequent pandemic waves.","output":"Characterising within-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission events: a retrospective analysis integrating epidemiological and viral genomic data from a UK tertiary care setting across two pandemic waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency response mechanisms were activated throughout China during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is different from the temporary, partial, and limited pollution control measures taken to ensure the regional environmental quality during several important events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). During the COVID-19 epidemic period, extensive movement of people and almost all unnecessary industrial production (necessary industrial production refers to the production of food, epidemic prevention materials, etc.) have been severely restricted, so transportation and industrial production have been greatly reduced. This is a rare extreme emission reduction scenario that presents a unique opportunity for atmospheric research. In this study, based on hourly mass concentration data of NO(2) and SO(2) from atmospheric monitoring sites in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during the COVID-19 epidemic period, the changes in transportation and industrial production in the region, data statistics, and spatial analysis were used to analyze the pollution changes and their causes. The results indicate that the NO(2) and SO(2) concentrations in the BTH region decreased significantly during the epidemic period. The spatial distribution pattern of NO(2) pollution in the BTH region was high in the southeast and low in the northwest, and SO(2) pollution in the BTH region was high in the southern and eastern parts of Hebei. The initiation of emergency response level 1 had an obvious effect on reducing NO(2) and SO(2) pollution in the region, while the impact of emergency response level 2 and below was limited. Compared with the single traffic control, the comprehensive control, similar to the emergency response, had a better effect on reducing NO(2) pollution in the region. The control of major large cities in the region also had a certain effect on alleviating NO(2) and SO(2) pollution in the entire region. Moreover, for activities under short-term control, it is particularly important to guard against the retaliatory growth after the control is lifted. By reducing and controlling some polluting industries in industrial production, the degree of NO(2) and SO(2) pollution in the region can be effectively reduced. The manufacturing industry of chemical raw materials and the chemical products and non-metallic mineral products industry made a great contribution to the change in industrial source pollution emissions in the BTH region during the COVID-19 epidemic. Road traffic emissions remained an important source of NO(2) emissions in the BTH region during this period. NO(2) emission reduction can be effectively achieved by controlling road traffic and transportation.","output":"Spatial and temporal variation characteristics of atmospheric NO(2) and SO(2) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region before and after the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper is a response, of sorts, to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID) and lockdown that we all must face. We have an idea of what doctors, nurses, teachers, among many of the other professions, do for the general public, but one may ask whether there is something substantial that philosophers and ethicists can offer in these circumstances. The thesis of this paper is that the stoic attitude towards times of trouble and the pragmatist way of finding out what is possible to elevate the quality of living against all odds, if skilfully interwoven, could be an important tool in keeping mental health in good shape and, additionally, could contribute to the cultural scene at large. If this is the case, stoic pragmatists can indeed offer an interesting example of practical philosophy for many audiences, especially during the pandemic lockdown and, perhaps, for other serious difficulties or problems. To be effective in delivering their message, stoic pragmatists, as most with philosophers today, should enrich their textual and oral modes of traditional transmission of knowledge and become digital-culture public intellectuals that can recognize and reach more general audiences by, among other things, visual modes of digital communication. ? 2021 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroski, published by Sciendo 2021.","output":"Stoic pragmatist ethics in the time of pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children with disabilities (CWD) tend to participate in fewer physical activities than typically developing children. During motor play, CWD often depend on teachers to provide direct instruction and frequent opportunities to practice motor skills, to interact with their peers, and learn new skills. To promote participation in physical activities for CWD, it is necessary to understand (a) teachers perceptions about the importance of structured motor programs and (b) teachers thoughts and concerns about implementing structured motor programs. The aim of this study was to understand teachers perceptions about structured motor programs (e.g., obstacle course, bowling) and factors that may influence their motivation to implement them. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 teachers who taught in inclusive preschools. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed to identify key themes. The results show that the majority of participants valued structured motor programs and were aware of the benefits of implementing such programs with preschoolers. Several teachers expressed concerns about meeting the expectations of a motor program and preschoolers challenging behaviors during such programs. Implications for practice from this study include the need to (a) provide professional development to help teachers support preschoolers with disabilities in learning motor skills and understanding how to arrange and scaffold opportunities for children to participate in physical activities and gross motor play with their typically developing peers, and (b) create quality structured motor programs to ensure that all children have access to motor learning opportunities in inclusive preschool settings.","output":"Exploring the Perspectives of Preschool Teachers on Implementing Structured Motor Programs in Inclusive Classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Youth, working age and the elderly: On a timeline, chronological age (CA) and biological age (BA) may dissociate; nosological entities manifest themselves at different BAs.

The aim of this study was to characterize the D614 G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, which may affect viral infectivity. METHODS: The effect of D614 G mutation on the structure and thermodynamic stability of S-protein was analyzed using DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S-protein RARR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to predict S-protein apo structure, S-proteinCfurin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. RESULTS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased thermal stability of S-protein (G: ?0.086 kcal/mol). The mutation resulted in a stronger binding affinity (K(d) = 1.6  10(?8)) to furin which may enhance S-protein cleavage. Results were corroborated by MD simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin to S-protein D614 mutant (?61.9 kcal/mol compared with -56.78 kcal/mol for wild-type S-protein). CONCLUSIONS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade induced the flexibility of S-protein, resulting in increased furin binding which may enhance S-protein cleave and infiltration of host cells.

Data on SCID from developing countries are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and laboratory features of SCID diagnosed at immunology centers across India. METHODS: A detailed case proforma in an Excel format was prepared by one of the authors (PV) and was sent to centers in India that care for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. We collated clinical, laboratory, and molecular details of patients with clinical profile suggestive of SCID and their outcomes. Twelve (12) centers provided necessary details which were then compiled and analyzed. Diagnosis of SCID/combined immune deficiency (CID) was based on 2018 European Society for Immunodeficiencies working definition for SCID. RESULTS: We obtained data on 277 children; 254 were categorized as SCID and 23 as CID. Male-female ratio was 196:81. Median (inter-quartile range) age of onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis was 2.5 months (1, 5) and 5 months (3.5, 8), respectively. Molecular diagnosis was obtained in 162 patients - IL2RG (36), RAG1 (26), ADA (19), RAG2 (17), JAK3 (15), DCLRE1C (13), IL7RA (9), PNP (3), RFXAP (3), CIITA (2), RFXANK (2), NHEJ1 (2), CD3E (2), CD3D (2), RFX5 (2), ZAP70 (2), STK4 (1), CORO1A (1), STIM1 (1), PRKDC (1), AK2 (1), DOCK2 (1), and SP100 (1). Only 23 children (8.3%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Of these, 11 are doing well post-HSCT. Mortality was recorded in 210 children (75.8%). CONCLUSION: We document an exponential rise in number of cases diagnosed to have SCID over the last 10 years, probably as a result of increasing awareness and improvement in diagnostic facilities at various centers in India. We suspect that these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. Majority of patients with SCID in India are probably not being recognized and diagnosed at present. Newborn screening for SCID is the need of the hour.

Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings.

Here, we used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and Tolllike receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. Low doses RT (0.5-1 Gy) decreased LPS induced pneumonia, and increased the percentage of Nerve- and Airway-associated Macrophages (NAMs) producing IL-10. During H1N1 viral infection, we observed decreased lung tissue damage and immune cell infiltration in irradiated animals. Low doses RT increased IL-10 production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Irradiation of TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFN production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased.

Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. Results A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the N-terminal domain alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the extended receptor binding domain but not the N-terminal domain had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans.

Clinicians in the US composed more automated note text than their non-US counterparts (77.5% vs 60.8% of note text; P < .001) and received statistically significantly more messages per day (33.8 vs 12.8; P < .001). Furthermore, US clinicians used the EHR for a longer time after hours, logging in 26.5 minutes per day vs 19.5 minutes per day for non-US clinicians (P = .01). The median US clinician spent as much time actively using the EHR per day (90.1 minutes) as a non-US clinician in the 99th percentile of active EHR use time per day (90.7 minutes) in the sample. These results persisted after controlling for organizational characteristics, including structure, type, size, and daily patient volume. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that US clinicians compared with their non-US counterparts spent substantially more time actively using the EHR for a wide range of clinical activities or tasks. This finding suggests that US clinicians have a greater EHR burden that may be associated with nontechnical factors, which policy makers and health system leaders should consider when addressing clinician wellness.","output":"Assessment of Electronic Health Record Use Between US and Non-US Health Systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a cornerstone management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) International respiratory societies defined PR is more than \\"just an exercise program\\";it is a comprehensive care delivered by a team of dedicated healthcare professionals with a strong emphasis on long-term health-enhancing Behaviors However, \\"Uncertainty\\" exists with varied reasons for the political and geographical barriers of referral, uptake, attendance, and completion of PR in both primary and secondary care Besides, COVID-19 pandemic has sparked many global controversies and challenges on pulmonary rehabilitation service delivery Post-COVID-19 guidelines emphasize on integrated care rehabilitation for patients with COPD Thus, this concise review intends to understand the gaps in United Kingdom healthcare policies, practices, and PR services resources To date, there is no clear consensus on PR integrated care model pathway to address the unmet needs, measure the health and social care disparities;adds to the disease burden of COPD Based on the culmination of evidence, this perspective offers a theoretical framework of PR integrated service model, a pathway to deliver high-value personalized care to patients with COPD","output":"Renewed vision on pulmonary rehabilitation service delivery for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management beyond COVID -19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global concern.

Methods: Google searches for the names Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd were obtained from the Google Health Application Programming Interface (API). Using the Twitter API, we collected a 1% random sample of publicly available U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019CSeptember 2020 (N = 3,380,616). Sentiment analysis was performed using Support Vector Machines, a supervised machine learning model. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on a random sample of 3,000 tweets to understand themes in discussions of race and racism and inform interpretation of the quantitative trends. Results: The highest rate of Google searches for any of the three names was for George Floyd during the week of May 31 to June 6, the week after his murder. The percent of tweets referencing Black people that were negative decreased by 32% (from 49.33% in November 4C9 to 33.66% in June 1C7) (p < 0.001), but this decline was temporary, lasting just a few weeks. Themes that emerged during the content analysis included discussion of race or racism in positive (14%) or negative (38%) tones, call for action related to racism (18%), and counter movement/arguments against racism-related changes (6%). Conclusion: Although there was a sharp decline in negative Black sentiment and increased public awareness of structural racism and desire for long-lasting social change, these shifts were transitory and returned to baseline after several weeks.

Among PWH, extended survival comes at a cost of earlier onset and increased rates of aging-associated comorbidities and geriatric syndromes, with persistent inflammation and immune dysregulation consequent to chronic HIV infection and to antiretroviral therapy use contributing to an overall decrease in health span. The geroscience hypothesis proposes that the root causes of most aging-related chronic diseases and conditions is the aging process itself. Hence, therapeutically targeting fundamental aging processes could have a greater impact on alleviating or delaying aging-associated comorbidities than addressing each disease individually. Extending the geroscience hypothesis to PWH, we speculate that targeting basic mechanisms of aging will improve overall health with age. Clinical features and pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic diseases in PWH qualitatively resemble those seen in older adults without HIV. Therefore, drugs that target any of the pillars of aging, including metformin, rapamycin, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors, may also slow the rate of onset of age-associated comorbidities and geriatric syndromes in PWH. Drugs that selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells, termed senolytics, may also improve health span among PWH. Preliminary evidence suggests that senescent cell burden is increased in PWH, implying that senescent cells are an excellent therapeutic target for extending health span. Recently initiated clinical trials evaluating senolytics in age-related diseases offer insights into the design and potential implementation of similar trials for PWH.","output":"Chronic HIV Infection and Aging: Application of a Geroscience-Guided Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been causing the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several million deaths being reported. Numerous investigations have been carried out to discover a compound that can inhibit the biological activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, which is an enzyme related to the viral replication. Among these, PF-07321332 (Nirmatrelvir) is currently under clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy. Therefore, in this work, atomistic and electronic simulations were performed to unravel the binding and covalent inhibition mechanism of the compound to M(pro). Initially, 5 s of steered-molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to evaluate the ligand-binding process to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The successfully generated bound state between the two molecules showed the important role of the PF-07321332 pyrrolidinyl group and the residues Glu166 and Gln189 in the ligand-binding process. Moreover, from the MD-refined structure, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were carried out to unravel the reaction mechanism for the formation of the thioimidate product from SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and the PF-07321332 inhibitor. We found that the catalytic triad Cys145CHis41CAsp187 of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) plays an important role in the activation of the PF-07321332 covalent inhibitor, which renders the deprotonation of Cys145 and, thus, facilitates further reaction.

However, high levels of disease or mortality in such flocks impair economic development and challenge the livelihoods of many rural households. We investigated 61 diseased small-scale flocks (122 chickens) for evidence of infection with 5 bacteria, 4 viruses, and helminths. Serological profiles (ELISA) were also determined against 6 of these pathogens. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to investigate the prevalence of different pathogens and to compare the probability of detection of bacterial pathogens using PCR and culture; (2) to investigate the relationship between detection of organisms in birds' tissues and the observed morbidity and mortality, as well as their antibody profile; and (3) to characterize risk factors for infection with specific viral or bacterial pathogens. We used PCR to test for viral (viruses causing infectious bronchitis [IB], highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease [IBD]) and bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale [ORT]). The latter two were also investigated in respiratory tissues by conventional culture. Colisepticemic Escherichia coli was investigated by liver or spleen culture. In 49 of 61 (80.3%) flocks, at least one bacterial or viral pathogen was detected, and in 29 (47.5%) flocks, more than one pathogen was detected. A. paragallinarum was detected in 62.3% flocks, followed by M. gallisepticum (26.2%), viruses causing IBD (24.6%) and IB (21.3%), septicemic E. coli (14.8%), ORT (13.1%), and HPAI viruses (4.9%).

However, it is unclear whether insulin acts prophylactically against olfactotoxic drug-induced olfactory epithelium (OE) injury, and whether the degree of damage is affected by the concentration of insulin in the nasal mucus. The apoptosis-inducing drug methimazole was administered to the nasal mucus of diabetic and normal mice along with different concentrations of insulin. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to assess the relationship between damage to the OE and the mucus insulin concentration and the protective effect of insulin administration against eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP)-induced OE injury. Diabetic mice had lower concentrations of insulin in their nasal mucus than normal mice (diabetic vs. normal mice, p < 0.001). Methimazole administration reduced the number of OSNs in normal mice and had a more marked effect in diabetic mice. However, unilateral insulin administration prevented the methimazole-induced reduction in the number of OSNs on the ipsilateral side but not on the contralateral side (OSNs; Insulin vs. contralateral side, p < 0.001). Furthermore, intranasal ECP administration damaged the OE by inducing apoptosis (OSNs; ECP vs. contralateral side, p < 0.001), but this damage was largely prevented by insulin administration (OSNs; Insulin + ECP vs. contralateral side, p = 0.36), which maintained the number of mature OSNs. The severity of methimazole-induced damage to the OE is related to the insulin concentration in the nasal mucus (Correlation between the insulin concentration in nasal mucus and the numbers of OSNs, R(2) = 0.91, p < 0.001), which may imply that nasal insulin protects OSNs and that insulin administration might lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for ECP-induced OE injury.","output":"Protective Effect of Insulin in Mouse Nasal Mucus Against Olfactory Epithelium Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies being present in COVID\\\\19\\\\infected patients.

However, these procedures remain technically demanding due to flexible technology issues: difficult imaging, limited energy devices, lack of staplers, unsatisfactory suturing abilities, and so on. Transgastric laparoscopy or hybrid laparoscopy/flex endoscopy has been described for almost two decades as an alternative to a pure endoluminal approach, mainly for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and full-thickness and mucosal resection of various lesions. The approach has never been widely adopted mostly due to cumbersome and difficult to maintain methods of gastric access. We propose to expand the indications of transgastric laparoscopy by using novel endoscopically placed ports to replicate endoscopic procedures particularly in the difficult to access proximal stomach such as endoluminal antireflux surgery. Under general anesthesia, five female pigs (mean weight: 27.6 kg) had endoscopic placement of 3, 5 mm intragastric ports (Endo-TAGSS, Leakwood KS, USA) using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5-mm laparoscope was used for visualization. Laparoendoscopic-assisted plication of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) was performed using 3-0 interrupted sutures (Polysorb?, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). A functional lumen imagine probe (EndoFLIP?, Crospon, Inc., Galway, Ireland) was used to measure diameter, cross sectional area (CSA), distensibility, and compliance of GEJ before and after intervention. Once the TAGSS ports were removed, the gastrotomies were closed by using endoscopic over-the-scope clips. At the end of the procedure, animals were euthanized. Five laparoendoscopic-assisted endoluminal plications were performed. The mean operative time was 65.6 min (Endoscopic evaluation: 3.2 min, TAGSS Insertion: 11 min, EndoFLIP evaluation + GEJ Plication: 43.25 min, gastric wall closure: 15 minutes). In all cases, this technique was effective and allowed to achieve an adequate GEJ plication by endoscopic grading and EndoFLIP measurements. Median pre-plication GEJ diameter (D) and median pre-plication GEJ cross-sectional area (CSA) were 11.42 mm (8.6-13.6 mm) and 104.8 mm2 (58-146 mm2). After the procedure, these values were decreased to 6.14 mm (5.7-6.6 mm) and 29.8 mm2 (25-34 mm2) respectively (p = 0.0079). Median pre-plication distensibility (d) and compliance (C) were 7.87 mm2/mmHg (2.4-22.69 mm2/mmHg) and 190.56 mm3/mmHg (70.9-502.8 mm3/mmHg). After the procedure, these values decreased to 1.5 mm2/mmHg (0.7-2.2 mm2/mmHg) and 52.17 mm3/mmHg (21.9-98.7 mm3/mmHg) respectively (p = 0.0317). No intraoperative events were observed. Endoscopically, all valves were felt to be transitioned from a Hill grade 3 (normal state for the animal model) to a Hill grade 1 at the procedure completion. A hybrid laparoendoscopic approach is a feasible alternative for performing intragastric procedures with the assistance of conventional laparoscopic instruments; especially in cases where the intervention location limits the access to standard endoscopy or where endoscopic technology is inadequate.

Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.","output":"Flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 led to the reconfiguration of U.K. orthopaedic trauma services because surgical capacity was threatened in acute centers.

Care was modeled according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, and efforts were made to treat all patients within 36 hours. Data were collected prospectively, and mortality outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 192 patients who presented to the elective orthopaedic center, 167 were treated there. The median age of the latter patients was 88 years (interquartile range, 83 to 79 years). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4 (interquartile range, 4 to 6). The median time from emergency department admission to surgical treatment was 24.5 hours (interquartile range, 18.8 to 34.7 hours). The 30-day rate of mortality was 10.2%. A total of 29 (17.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 during their admission, of whom 10 died, for a case-fatality rate of 34.5%.

We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (18 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977). FINDINGS 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -025 [95% CI -049 to -001]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 036 [95% CI 010 to 062]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 199 [95% CI 120 to 329]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (278 [159 to 486]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. INTERPRETATION There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.

Tetracyclines were developed as a result of the screening of soil samples for antibiotic organisms. The first of these compounds chlortetracycline was introduced in 1948. Soon after their development tetracyclines were found to be highly effective against various pathogens including rickettsiae, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria, thus, becoming a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The mechanism of action of tetracyclines is thought to be related to the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S bacterial ribosome. Tetracyclines are also an effective anti-malarial drug. Over time, many other \\"protective\\" actions have been described for tetracyclines. Minocycline, which can readily cross cell membranes, is known to be a potent anti-apoptotic agent. Its mechanism of action appears to relate to specific effects exerted on apoptosis signaling pathways. Another tetracycline, doxycycline is known to exert antiprotease activities. Doxycycline can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to tissue destruction activities in diseases such as gingivitis. A large body of literature has provided additional evidence for the \\"beneficial\\" actions of tetracyclines, including their ability to act as oxygen radical scavengers and anti-inflammatory agents. This increasing volume of published work and ongoing clinical trials supports the notion that a more systematic examination of their possible therapeutic uses is warranted. This review provides a summary of tetracycline's multiple mechanisms of action and while using the effects on the heart as an example, this review also notes their potential to benefit patients suffering from various pathologies such as cancer, Rosacea, and Parkinson's disease.","output":"Tetracyclines: a pleitropic family of compounds with promising therapeutic properties.

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8  109/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis of COVID-19 in the surrounding areas of Wuhan, Hubei Province in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing for COVID-19 is especially challenging because transmission often occurs in the absence of symptoms and because a purported 20% of cases cause 80% of infections, resulting in a small risk of infection for some contacts and a high risk for others. Here, we introduce risk-based quarantine, a system for contact tracing where each cluster (a group of individuals with a common source of exposure) is observed for symptoms when tracing begins, and clusters that do not display them are released from quarantine. We show that, under our assumptions, risk-based quarantine reduces the amount of quarantine time served by more than 30%, while achieving a reduction in transmission similar to standard contact tracing policies where all contacts are quarantined for two weeks. We compare our proposed risk-based quarantine approach against test-driven release policies, which fail to achieve a comparable level of transmission reduction due to the inability of tests to detect exposed people who are not yet infectious but will eventually become so. Additionally, test-based release policies are expensive, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource environments, whereas the costs imposed by risk-based quarantine are primarily in terms of labor and organization.","output":"Designing Efficient Contact Tracing Through Risk-Based Quarantining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a devastating threat to human society in terms of health, economy, and lifestyle. Although the virus usually first invades and infects the lung and respiratory track tissue, in extreme cases, almost all major organs in the body are now known to be negatively impacted often leading to severe systemic failure in some people. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for this disease. Pre-existing pathological conditions or comorbidities such as age are a major reason for premature death and increased morbidity and mortality. The immobilization due to hospitalization and bed rest and the physical inactivity due to sustained quarantine and social distancing can downregulate the ability of organs systems to resist to viral infection and increase the risk of damage to the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal systems and the brain.

Only a few studies have examined the attitudes and conflicts faced by physician fathers, the majority of current practitioners. This work is a subset analysis of responses to qualitative questions on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of emergency physician (EP) fathers. Methods: A convenience sample of physician fathers was obtained from May 2 to June 16, 2020, via social media and email. The survey contained questions on personal and professional struggles during the start of the pandemic and including several free test questions. Free responses were analyzed and coded. Several themes emerged related to experiences described: (1) self;(2) social;(3) home life;(4) work life;(5) financial;(6) immediate family. Under each main theme were subthemes that provided a more detailed match for each comment. Results: There were 260 surveys completed by EP fathers from 31 states. 84% were White, 9% Asian, 1% Black, 5% other. 78% were between 30-49 years;98% reported having a partner. Most fathers had younger children (infants through middle-school aged) living in the household with them at the time of the survey. The three most common themes were work life (38%), immediate family (20%), and social (15%). In work life the most common subthemes were general change in responsibilities (29%), decrease in workload/unemployed (21%), and concerns/negative feelings towards work (18%). In immediate family both positive change in family life (45%) and negative change in family life (19%) predominated. Under social, missing/lacking social interaction (49%) and missed/cancelled events (33%) were most common. Of note in other themes in self, the two most common subthemes were negative mental state (45%) and decreased productivity (12%). In home life, change in usual routine/structure/schedule was the most common (42%) followed by difficulty caring/assisting children (28%). The financial theme was dominated by the subtheme financial issues/loss (94%). Conclusions: This study examined reported concerns and attitudes of EP fathers during the COVID-19 pandemic. EP fathers reported a variety challenges affecting both their personal and professional lives with positive and negative changes.

The measures used to contain transmission have led to increased stress and put parents at increased risk for parental burnout (PB). The aim of the current study was to examine the association between COVID-related parental stress and PB, and to test whether emotion regulation (ER) moderated this association. We hypothesised that rumination, which is a generally maladaptive ER strategy, would act as a risk factor. In comparison, we hypothesised that reappraisal, which is a generally adaptive ER strategy, would act as a resilience factor. We assessed 8225 parents from 22 countries using an on-line survey, and focused on general stress and parenting stress. These stressors were associated with greater PB. Importantly, parental ER moderated these associations; rumination strengthened the link between stress-related variables and PB, whereas reappraisal weakened it.

Despite several observational studies early in the pandemic affirming their beneficial role in treating COVID-19, 12 clinical studies reported no mortality benefits for CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 patients.

Patients and Methods: This study included the application of AG treatment and PD-1 combined with AG treatment with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from September 2018 to July 2020. Clinical information and next-generation sequencing (NGS) reports of patients were collected to compare the effectiveness and adverse events of the two treatments and analyze the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients. Results: There was no difference in PFS between the AG group and the PD-1+AG group (4.9 months vs 5.0 months, P = 0.154), but the difference in OS was statistically significant (9.3 months vs 12.1 months, P < 0.001). Compared with the AG group, the PD-1+AG group reduced the risk of death about 20.0% (HR = 0.203, 95% CI, 0.090-0.459, P < 0.001). In terms of safety, the incidence of hypothyroidism and reactive skin capillary hyperplasia in PD-1 + AG group was higher than that in AG group (P < 0.050) in grade 1-2; grade 3-4 adverse reactions were mainly hematologic AEs and abnormal liver function. The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse reactions in the two groups was 38.7% (95% CI, 20.5-56.9%) and 35.3% (95% CI, 10.0-60.6%), respectively. In addition, PD-1+ AG regimen improved the OS of patients with KRAS and TP53 co-mutations (8.0months vs 10.2 months, P = 0.004). Conclusion: PD-1 inhibitors combined with AG chemotherapy have shown good efficacy and safety in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

As there is a current lack of approved treatments and vaccines, universal safety precautions (USPs) must be taken to deal with this emergency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public with regard to USPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered questionnaire was developed, validated and distributed using Google Forms through social media networks. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors influencing knowledge regarding COVID-19 USPs. RESULTS: Of the 1117 individuals who participated in the survey, the mean age was 28.8  10.9 years, 32.9% had a post-graduate education, 45% had a professional job, and 40% belonged to the upper-middle economic class. Overall, the mean correct response scores were 63% for USP knowledge and 83% for USP beliefs. All the sociodemographic variables were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the USP knowledge levels. Importantly, students were less likely to have a lower level of USP knowledge compared with the other occupations (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.23C0.53; p < 0.001).

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) holds promise as a broad-spectrum, therapeutic target because of the conserved nature of the nucleotide-substrate-binding and catalytic sites. Conventional, quantitative, kinetic analysis of antiviral ribonucleotides monitors one or a few incorporation events. Here, we use a high-throughput magnetic tweezers platform to monitor the elongation dynamics of a prototypical RdRp over thousands of nucleotide-addition cycles in the absence and presence of a suite of nucleotide analog inhibitors. We observe multiple RdRp-RNA elongation complexes; only a subset of which are competent for analog utilization. Incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide nucleotide analog, T-1106, leads to RdRp backtracking. This analysis reveals a mechanism of action for this antiviral ribonucleotide that is corroborated by cellular studies. We propose that induced backtracking represents a distinct mechanistic class of antiviral ribonucleotides.","output":"Signatures of Nucleotide Analog Incorporation by an RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Revealed Using High-Throughput Magnetic Tweezers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is limited information on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD). Methods: 136 consecutive patients with rheumatic diseases who never had a diagnosis of COVID-19 previously, and had completed vaccination with either the ChAdOx1 or BBV152 vaccines were recruited. Their IgG antibody titres to the Spike protein were estimated 1 month after the second dose. Results: 102 patients had AIRD while the 34 had non-AIRD. Lesser patients with AIRD (92/102) had positive antibodies titres than ones with non-AIRD(33/34) [p<0.001]. Amongst patients who received the ChAdOX1 vaccine, the AIRD group had lower antibody titres. Although the AIRD patients receiving BBV152 had similarly lower titres numerically, this did not attain statistical significance probably due to lesser numbers. Comparing the two vaccines, 114(95%) of those who received ChAdOx1 (n=120) and 11(68.7%) of those who received BBV152(n=16) had detectable antibodies [p=0.004] . Antibody titres also were higher in ChAdOx1 recipients when compared to BBV152. To validate the findings, we estimated antibody titres in 30 healthy people each who had received either vaccine. All 30 who had received ChAdOX1 and only 23/30 of those who had received BBV152 had positive antibodies (p=0.011). Conclusion: In this preliminary analysis, patients with AIRD had lower seroconversion rates as well as lower antibody titres as compared to patients with non-AIRD. Also,the humoral immunogenicity of the BBV152 vaccine appears to be less than that of the ChAdOX1 vaccine. Validation using larger numbers and testing of cellular immunity is urgently required.","output":"Immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and the BBV152 Vaccines in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting from the relationship between urban planning and mobility management, TeMA has gradually expanded the view of the covered topics, always following a rigorous scientific in-depth analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were enrolled, including 77 Delta variant-infected patients and 80 Omicron variant-infected patients. Liver injury data and clinical data were summarized and compared between patients infected with the two variants, additionally, patients with or without liver injury were also compared and multivariate analysis was performed to explore the predictive factors related to liver injury in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. RESULTS: Liver injury was found in 18 (23.4%)/15 (18.8%) in Delta/Omicron variant-infected patients on admission, and 4 (5.2%)/1 (1.3%) in Delta/Omicron variant-infected patients during hospitalization, respectively. The ratios of liver injury did not differ between the two groups (2 = 1.571; P = 0.210). Among these patients, 17 (77.3%) and 12 (75.0%) Delta and Omicron variant-infected patients were considered to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the biomarkers of liver function were mildly elevated, dominated by the parameter of cholangiocyte injury: 76.5% (13/17) and 83.3% (10/12) in Delta and Omicron variant-infected patients, and most of these patients recovered to normal during follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex [odds ratio (OR), 4.476; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.235-16.222; P = 0.023] and high levels of peak viral load in the nasopharynx (OR, 3.022; 95% CI, 1.338-6.827; P = 0.008) were independent factors related to liver injury.

To confirm that the prepared data can be discriminated using DL, image classification was performed using the VGG-16 network. We comprehensively investigated the performances of the learned networks in the regression problem. The generalization ability was evaluated from independent images with the unlearned N. We found that, except for large N values, the standard deviation values were approximately 0.1 and 0.5 for A-component fractions of 0.2 and 0.35, respectively. The images for larger N values were more difficult to distinguish.

In these models the ability to assess pulmonary function and particularly airway responsiveness is critically important. Existing methods for testing pulmonary function in mice in vivo include noninvasive and invasive technologies. Noninvasive head-out body plethysmography is a well-established and widely accepted technique which has been proven as a reliable method to measure lung function on repeated occasions in intact, conscious mice. We have performed several validation studies in allergic mice to compare the parameter midexpiratory flow (EF(50)) as a noninvasive marker of airflow limitation with invasively measured gold standard parameters of lung mechanics. The results of these studies showed a good agreement of EF(50) with the invasive assessment of lung resistance and dynamic compliance with a somewhat lower sensitivity of EF(50). The measurement of EF(50) together with basic respiratory parameters is particularly appropriate for simple and repeatable screening of pulmonary function in large numbers of mice or if noninvasive measurement without use of anesthesia is required. Beyond known applications, head-out body plethysmography also provides a much-needed high-throughput screening tool to gain insights into the impact and kinetics of respiratory infections such as SARS-COV-2 on lung physiology in laboratory mice.","output":"Noninvasive Measurement of Pulmonary Function in Experimental Mouse Models of Airway Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Greece is among the European countries with the highest consumption of antibiotics, both in community and hospital settings, including last-line antibiotics, such as carbapenems.

Methods: A self-administered, internet-based questionnaire survey was completed by doctors of the University Hospital of Heraklion in Crete, Greece. Results: In total, 202 (59.1%) hospital doctors fully completed the questionnaire. Most of them agreed that the prospective audit and feedback ASP strategy is more effective and educational than the preauthorization ASP strategy. ASP implementation prompted most respondents to monitor the continuously evolving microbiological data of their patients more closely and affected them towards a multidisciplinary and personalised care of patients with infections caused by MDROs and towards a more rigorous implementation of infection prevention and control measures. The vast majority of participants (98.5%) stated that ASP must be continued and further developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This disease is characterized by simultaneous or sequential organ and system involvement, with unpredictable flare and high levels of morbidity and mortality. Racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, cost of medications, difficulty accessing health care, and poor adherence seem to impact lupus outcomes and treatment response. In this article, the management of cSLE patients is updated. Regarding pathogenesis, a number of potential targets for drugs have been studied. However, most treatments in pediatric patients are off-label drugs with recommendations based on inadequately powered studies, therapeutic consensus guidelines, or case series. Management practices for cSLE patients include evaluations of disease activity and cumulative damage scores, routine non-live vaccinations, physical activity, and addressing mental health issues. Antimalarials and glucocorticoids are still the most common drugs used to treat cSLE, and hydroxychloroquine is recommended for nearly all cSLE patients. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be standardized for each patient, based on disease flare and cSLE severity. Mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous cyclophosphamide is suggested as induction therapy for lupus nephritis classes III and IV. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, voclosporin) appear to be another good option for cSLE patients with lupus nephritis. Regarding B-cell-targeting biologic agents, rituximab may be used for refractory lupus nephritis patients in combination with another DMARD, and belimumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cSLE treatment in children aged > 5 years. New therapies targeting CD20, such as atacicept and telitacicept, seem to be promising drugs for SLE patients. Anti-interferon therapies (sifalimumab and anifrolumab) have shown beneficial results in phase II randomized control trials in adult SLE patients, as have some Janus kinase inhibitors, and these could be alternative treatments for pediatric patients with severe interferon-mediated inflammatory disease in the future. In addition, strict control of proteinuria and blood pressure is required in cSLE, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker use.","output":"An Update on the Management of Childhood-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relation existed in the social contact network can affect individuals behaviors greatly.

Objective To determine the cumulative incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, from a randomly selected sample of individuals normally resident at three Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) in Kenya. Design This was a cross-sectional population-based serosurvey conducted at Kilifi HDSS, Nairobi Urban HDSS, and Manyatta HDSS in Kenya. We selected age-stratified samples at HDSSs in Kilifi, Kisumu and Nairobi, in Kenya. Blood samples were collected from participants between 01 Dec 2020 and 27 May 2021. Setting Kilifi HDSS comprises a predominantly rural population, Manyatta HDSS comprises a predominantly semi-urban population, while Nairobi Urban HDSS comprises an urban population. The total population under regular surveillance at the three sites is ~470,000. Exposure We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Locally validated assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. Main Outcome and Measures The primary outcome measure was cumulative incidence of infection with SARS-COV-2 virus as evidenced by seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 whole spike protein. We adjusted our estimates using classical methods and Bayesian modelling to account for assay performance. We performed multivariable logistic regression to test associations between seropositivity and age category, time period and sex. Results We recruited 2,559 individuals from the three HDSS sites, median age (IQR) 27years (10-78) and 52% were female. Seroprevalence at all three sites rose steadily during the study period. In Kilifi, Kisumu and Nairobi, seroprevalences at the beginning of the study were 14.5 % (9.1-21), 36.0 (28.2-44.4) and 32.4 % (23.1-42.4) respectively; at the end they were 27.6 % (21.4-33.9), 42.0 % (34.7-50.0) and 50.2 % (39.7-61.1), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for sex and period of sample collections, age category was strongly associated with seroprevalence (p<0.001), with the highest seroprevalences being observed in the 35-44 and []65 year age categories. Conclusion There has been substantial unobserved transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population in Kenya.

METHODS: Lungs of 12 consecutive COVID-19 decedents consented for autopsy were evaluated for gross and histopathologic abnormalities. A complete Ghon en block dissection was performed on all cases; lung weights and gross characteristics recorded. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to characterize lymphocytic infiltrates and to assess SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein. RESULTS: Two distinct patterns of pulmonary involvement were identified. Three of 12 cases demonstrated a predominance of acute alveolar damage (DAD) while 9 of 12 cases demonstrated a marked increase in intra-alveolar macrophages in a fashion resembling desquamative interstitial pneumonia or macrophage activation syndrome (DIP/MAS). Two patterns were correlated solely with a statistically significant difference in the duration of illness. The group exhibiting DAD had duration of illness of 5.7 days while the group with DIP/MAS had duration of illness of 21.5 days (t-test p = 0.014).

We knew our Trust took these issues seriously but understood that our leaders faced competing pressures. By offering to help, we could help provide solutions and focus. Our aim was to use our voice, to result in greater reductions in operational carbon, better staff engagement, and education of staff and patients. A secondary aim was to promote staff wellbeing by taking action together, and creating a sense of connection, belonging, and hope around this shared value.MethodsThe Green at Barts Health staff group formed, and launched itself by presenting to the Board. Members were recruited by webinars, grand-rounds, regular meetings. Members shared a passion for sustainability and tackling climate change, and many hours of voluntary time were contributed towards the shared goals. We established stakeholder networks, used quality improvement methods, along with advocacy and relationship building.Results80 staff were recruited across 3 sites, including 10 paediatric clinicians.Advocacy work led to a quarterly Green Forum, with Board level representation, and key stakeholders to advance the Trusts green agenda.In response to influencing during this forum, our Trust has agreed to declare a Climate Emergency.Our paediatric education stream has delivered departmental teaching to colleagues on climate change and air pollution. Play therapist members have taken part in National Clean Air Day, working with paediatric inpatients to creat air pollution/clean air images for the newsletter.Quality improvement has resulted in collaboration with external partners, Centre for Sustainable Health (CSH) in development of their toolkit calculating CO2 emissions savings from switch to online vs face to face outpatient appointments.We have piloted clean air champions to increase engagement at the Trust in association with with external partners Global Action Plan (GAP).Advocacy towards a commitment to build the UKs first carbon net-zero hospital to replace Whipps Cross.ConclusionsConnecting through shared values, in this case, related to a desire to act on climate-change, can powerfully support a change agenda.

Even though diagnostic imaging is vital for identifying correct diagnoses and administrating the right treatment, low-value imagingin which the diagnostic test confers little to no clinical benefitis common and contributes to inappropriate and wasteful use of health care resources. There is a lack of knowledge on the types and extent of low-value imaging. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to identify, characterize, and quantify the extent of low-value diagnostic imaging examinations for adults and children. METHODS: A scoping review of the published literature was performed. Medline-Ovid, Embase-Ovid, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published from 2010 to September 2020. The search strategy was built from medical subject headings (Mesh) for Diagnostic imaging/Radiology OR Health service misuse/Medical overuse OR Procedures and Techniques Utilization/Facilities and Services Utilization. Articles in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, or Norwegian were included. RESULTS: A total of 39,986 records were identified and, of these, 370 studies were included in the final synthesis. Eighty-four low-value imaging examinations were identified. Imaging of atraumatic pain, routine imaging in minor head injury, trauma, thrombosis, urolithiasis, after thoracic interventions, fracture follow-up and cancer staging/follow-up were the most frequently identified low-value imaging examinations. The proportion of low-value imaging varied between 2 and 100% inappropriate or unnecessary examinations.

There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only two states in the United StatesIndiana and Connecticuthave reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize statewide prevalence of SARS-CoV-2.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections. In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS. Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.

Both of hydroxychloroquine monotherapy and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin treatment regimens cause QTc measurement to increase at a statistically significant level. We concluded that this increase in QTc did not cause ventricular arrhythmia.

Our current therapeutic arsenal is increasingly limited as bacteria are developing resistance at a rate that far outpaces our ability to create new treatments. Novel approaches to treating and curing bacterial infections are urgently needed. Bacterial kinases have been increasingly explored as novel drug targets and are poised for development into novel therapeutic agents to combat bacterial infections. This review describes several general classes of bacterial kinases that play important roles in bacterial growth, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm formation. General features of these kinase classes are discussed and areas of particular interest for the development of inhibitors will be highlighted. Small molecule kinase inhibitors are described and organized by phenotypic effect, spotlighting particularly interesting inhibitors with novel functions and potential therapeutic benefit. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of bacterial kinase inhibition as a viable strategy to combat bacterial infections and overcome the pressures of increasing antibiotic resistance.","output":"Evaluation of Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors as Novel Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obesity represents a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. Therefore, in order to reduce COVID-19 related comorbidities in obese population a continuation of obesity treatment is needed.

This study aimed to test the feasibility of a telematics pre-operative psychological and nutritional assessment as an alternative tool during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Twenty-six patients were contacted. The pre-operative assessment consisted in 3-weekly one-to-one online sessions and a final in-person multidisciplinary session. The protocol feasibility has been evaluated on the following outcome: rejection rate (%), dropout rate (%), compliance and satisfaction's degree. RESULTS Eighteen participants completed the whole protocol and 10% dropped-out. Seventy-two percent of participants obtained an excess weight loss 5%.

The methodological basis of the study encompasses the general and special methods of scientific inquiry (formal logical method, comparative law, structural-logical method, analysis and synthesis methods). The ways and possibilities of balancing the interests of rights-holders and society's interests (in particular patients' interests) have been studied. It is highlighted that compulsory licensing must be employed exclusively in view of the principle of proportionality, since any restrictions on human rights, including patent rights, must comply with the legislation in force and be proportionate to the potential threat. Comprehensive attention is paid to the interests of right holders (in our case, medicines manufacturers), their protection as well as the ways they abuse their patent rights. It is underlined that access to medicines and treatment is a prerequisite for the realization of the right to health and, consequently, is of social interest. However, in Ukraine today we face a situation in which the percentage of medicines purchased at patients' own expense is 88.2%. Such low medicines coverage on the part of the state is not characteristic of any European country. Compulsory licensing legislation, in particular, key international documents in this field, were thoroughly studied. The features of compulsory licensing have been formulated. The general trends regarding the use of this mechanism in the contemporary world have been determined. Based on the study, an evaluation of the effectiveness of compulsory licensing as a tool in the fight against abuse of patent rights is provided. There have been produced suggestions regarding amendments to the current legislation of Ukraine aiming to increase the effectiveness of compulsory licensing of medicines in general and under pandemic conditions in particular. First of all, it is an expansion of the sphere of compulsory licensing with respect to such intellectual property objects as industrial samples and trade secrets (know-hows).

Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics becomes completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also non perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and allows also to study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. For popular epidemiological models we prove the global convergence of control schemes based on the introduction of severe restrictions, like lockdowns, to contain epidemic.

In Ireland, implementation has been slow for multiple reasons. Our unit aimed to introduce day case tonsillectomy, following a pilot programme. Following a year of implementation we have reaudited our practice. We hypothesised that day case tonsillectomy is a practical and favourable solution to facilitate access to surgery in the context of long waiting times for ENT surgery. Methods This was a prospective audit collecting data on day case tonsillectomy. All patients for day case tonsillectomy were selected in OPD according to our inclusion criteria. We recorded demographical data, surgical technique, length of stay, failed discharges, bleeding rate and readmission rate. Results There was one primary haemorrhage within 24 hours of surgery (0.08%). There were 16 secondary bleeds, giving a rate of 13.9%. Of these, four patients required a return to theatre for the cessation of bleeding (3.5%). There was no statistical significance in bleed rate between surgical technique. Failed discharge rate was 6%. The average time from extubation to discharge was 6 hours and 53 minutes. Conclusions Our experience of day case tonsillectomy is that it is safe, feasible and efficient in a selected group of patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 1993, 326 patients referred to our department with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL, n=182) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=144) in complete remission underwent TBI either in single dose (190 patients: 10 Gy administered to the midplane, and 8 Gy to the lungs [STBI]) or in 6 fractions (136 patients: 12 Gy on 3 consecutive days, and 9 Gy to the lungs [FTBI]) before BMT. The male-to-female ratio was 204/122 (1.67), and the median age was 30 years (mean: 30  11, range: 3 to 63). The patients were analyzed according to 3 instantaneous dose rate groups: 118 patients in the LOW group (0.048 Gy/min), 188 in the MEDIUM group (> 0.048 and  0.09 Gy/min), and 20 in the HIGH group (> 0.09 cGy/min). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone in 250 patients, CY and other drugs in 54, and 22 patients were conditioned using combinations without CY. Following TBI, allogeneic and autologous BMT were realized respectively in 118 and 208 patients. Median follow-up period was 68 months (mean: 67  29, range: 24 to 130 months). RESULTS: Five-year survival, LFS, RI and TRM rates were 42%, 40%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Five-year LFS was 36% in the STBI and 45% in the FTBI group (p = 0.17). It was 36% in the LOW group, 42% in the MEDIUM group, and 30% in the HIGH group (p > 0.05). Five-year RI was 50% in STBI, 43% in FTBI, 55% in LOW, 41% in MEDIUM, and 44% in HIGH groups (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0.48; LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.03: MEDIUM vs. HIGH, p = 0.68). TRM was not influenced significantly by the different TBI techniques. When analyzing separately the influence of fractionation and the instantaneous dose rate either in ANLL or ALL patients, no difference in terms of survival and LFS was observed. Fractionation did not influence the 5-year RI both in ANLL and ALL patients. However, among the patients with ANLL, 5-year RI was significantly higher (58%) in the LOW group than the MEDIUM group (31%, p = 0.001), whereas instantaneous dose rate did not significantly influence the RI in ALL patients. The 5-year TRM rate was significantly higher in allogeneic BMT group both in ANLL (37%) and ALL (37%) patients than those treated by autologous BMT (ANLL: 15%, ALL: 18%: p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). The 5-year estimated interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and cataract incidence rates were 22% and 19%, respectively, in all patients. IP incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) than the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. Furthermore, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by fractionation (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%; p = 0.003) and instantaneous dose rate (LOW vs. MEDIUM vs. HIGH, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the best factors influencing the survival were 1st CR (p = 0.0007), age  40 years (p = 0.003), and BMT after 1985 (p = 0.008). The RI was influenced independently only by the remission status (p = 0.0002). On the other hand, the TRM rate was lower in patients who did not experience graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD, p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). GvHD was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p = 0.01). When considering the cataract incidence, the only independent factor was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: The outcome of BMT patients conditioned with TBI for acute leukemia was not significantly influenced by the TBI technique, and TRM seemed to be lower in patients treated after 1985. On the other hand, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by the instantaneous dose rate.","output":"Total-body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia in first or second complete remission: Results and prognostic factors in 326 consecutive patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Index-tracking fixed-income ETFs have experienced an explosive growth spurt to reach $1 trillion in 2020.

A variety of dietary approaches have been examined to halt this rapid trend; however, the effects of modified-Paleo diet and medium-carbohydrate diet on inflammation, adipokines, hepatokines, and the profile of endothelial microparticles in individuals with metabolic syndrome have not been investigated in detail. The present study is designed to examine the effect of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diet with two delivery modes: fixed diet plan vs calorie counting on weight, body composition, serum levels of some hepatokines and adipocytokines, and flow cytometric analysis of endothelial microparticles in adults with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Eighty metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited in this study. They will be randomly allocated to one of the following 4 groups: (1) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with calorie counting, (2) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with a fixed diet plan, (3) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with calorie counting, and (4) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with a fixed diet plan for 10 weeks. Weight, height, waist circumference, and body composition will be assessed at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Serum insulin, asprosin, chemerin, FGF-21, CTRP-1, PYY, ghrelin, plasma EMPs (CD31+/CD42b? and CD144+/CD42b?), lipid profile, glycemic indices, hs-CRP, leptin, vitamin C, creatinine and satiety, hunger, fullness, and desire to eat (via visual analog scales) will be measured at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the HOMA-IR and QUICKI equations.

One approach is in silico drug design based on our existing knowledge of the biology of a specific disease and the specific target site binding chemistry. Based on this knowledge, a range of molecules will be designed and synthesised after which they will be tested in in vitro bioassays for activity and toxicity. The best candidates, called lead compounds, will then be fine-tuned by chemical derivatisation in order to improve their activity and/or to reduce their toxicity. Lead compounds are then tested in various animal models before entering clinical trials in people. Another approach is to screen a large number of biological samples (plants, bacteria and fungi) for activity against a specific disease. Any active extract, consisting of many compounds, will be fractionated by chromatographic techniques, and each fraction will be tested for in vitro activity. Active fractions will again be fractionated until the active compound is identified. This process, also called bioguided fractionation, can go through a number of fractionation cycles before the active compound is identified. The active compound will be chemically derivatised in order to improve its properties before in vivo animal studies will be conducted. Based on these test results, the most promising lead compounds will then be tested in clinical trials in people. There are however a number of shortcomings with both approaches. It is expensive, time consuming, makes use of in vitro bioassays and it suffers from a very low success rate. Due to these shortcomings, it is currently estimated that the development of one new drug costs around $1C1.5 billion, simply because so many lead compounds fail during clinical trials. Keeping these high costs in mind, one would think that all registered drugs are effective and importantly non-toxic. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as there are a number of drugs currently on the market that are causing severe side effects and whose efficacy should be questioned. This holds true particularly for cancer chemotherapeutics. It was estimated that cancer chemotherapy improves the average 5-year survival rate of patients (for all cancer types) by only 2 % (Morgan et al. 2004). Another relatively unknown fact is that each year, 200,000 people die in the EU due to adverse drug reactions (all types of drugs), highlighting the severe shortcomings of the drug development and drug licensing pipelines (Archibald and Coleman 2012).

In hospitalized COVID-19 patients' mild increases of hsTn or NTproBNP may be explained by cardiovascular comorbidities and direct or indirect cardiac damage or stress caused by or during COVID-19 pneumonia.

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","output":"A longitudinal and geospatial analysis of COVID-19 tweets during the early outbreak period in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a mathematical framework to analyze and interpret the outcomes of human challenge trials.

Extreme production of many kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occur in severe COVID-19 that called cytokine storm. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and can be stimulated by a vast range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Thus, STAT-3 can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses during coronavirus infections. STAT-3 can also suppress anti-virus interferon response and induce unbalanced anti-virus adaptive immune response, through influencing Th17-, Th1-, Treg-, and B cell-mediated functions. Furthermore, STAT-3 can contribute to the M2 macrophage polarization, lung fibrosis and thrombosis. Moreover, STAT-3 may be directly targeted by some virus-derived protein and operate as a pro-viral or anti-viral element in a virus-specific process.

However, the mechanisms of host-range change involved in most of these viral emergences, particularly the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to new hosts, remain poorly understood. We studied the emergence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus pathogen of people and equines that has had severe health and economic effects in the Americas since the early 20th century. Between epidemics, VEE disappears for periods up to decades, and the viral source of outbreaks has remained enigmatic. Combined with phylogenetic analyses to predict mutations associated with a 1992-1993 epidemic, we used reverse genetic studies to identify an envelope glycoprotein gene mutation that mediated emergence. This mutation allowed an enzootic, equine-avirulent VEEV strain, which circulates among rodents in nearby forests to adapt for equine amplification. RNA viruses including alphaviruses exhibit high mutation frequencies. Therefore, ecological and epidemiological factors probably constrain the frequency of VEE epidemics more than the generation, via mutation, of amplification-competent (high equine viremia) virus strains. These results underscore the ability of RNA viruses to alter their host range, virulence, and epidemic potential via minor genetic changes. VEE also demonstrates the unpredictable risks to human health of anthropogenic changes such as the introduction of equines and humans into habitats that harbor zoonotic RNA viruses.","output":"Venezuelan encephalitis emergence mediated by a phylogenetically predicted viral mutation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Objetivo: Apreender os impactos na sade mental de profissionais de Enfermagem face s interaes com o 'novo' da pandemia da Covid-19.

An acyltransferase complex ZDHHC5/GOGAL7 that interacts with S protein was detected by affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). However, the palmitoylated cysteine residues of S protein, the effects of ZDHHC5 or GOLGA7 knockout on S proteins subcellular localization, palmitoylation, pseudovirus entry and the enzyme for depalmitoylation of S protein are not clear. METHODS: The palmitoylated cysteine residues of S protein were identified by acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assays. The interactions between S protein and host proteins were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. Subcellular localizations of S protein and host proteins were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. ZDHHC5 or GOGAL7 gene was edited by CRISPR-Cas9. The entry efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into A549 and Hela cells were analyzed by measuring the activity of Renilla luciferase. RESULTS: In this investigation, all ten cysteine residues in the endodomain of S protein were palmitoylated. The interaction of S protein with ZDHHC5 or GOLGA7 was confirmed. The interaction and colocalization of S protein with ZDHHC5 or GOLGA7 were independent of the ten cysteine residues in the endodomain of S protein. The interaction between S protein and ZDHHC5 was independent of the enzymatic activity and the PDZ-binding domain of ZDHHC5. Three cell lines HEK293T, A549 and Hela lacking ZDHHC5 or GOLGA7 were constructed. Furthermore, S proteins still interacted with one host protein in HEK293T cells lacking the other. ZDHHC5 or GOLGA7 knockout had no significant effect on S proteins subcellular localization or palmitoylation, but significantly decreased the entry efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into A549 and Hela cells, while varying degrees of entry efficiencies may be linked to the cell types. Additionally, the S protein interacted with the depalmitoylase APT2. CONCLUSIONS: ZDHHC5 and GOLGA7 played important roles in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, but the reason why the two host proteins affected pseudovirus entry remains to be further explored. This study extends the knowledge about the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and host proteins and probably provides a reference for the corresponding antiviral methods.","output":"The interactions of ZDHHC5/GOLGA7 with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and their effects on S proteins subcellular localization, palmitoylation and pseudovirus entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobility and technology can facilitate in-person and virtual social participation to help reduce social isolation, but issues exist regarding older adults' access, feasibility, and motivation to use various forms of mobility and technology.

Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells.

The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis. Screening of 11 IBV-encoded proteins suggested that a 58-kDa mature cleavage product could induce apoptotic changes in cells transiently expressing the protein.

Ozone protocol consisted of 8 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone (150 mL volume, 35 g/mL concentration [5.25mg total dose]). The SOC protocol included O(2) supply, antivirals (Remdesivir), corticosteroids (Dexamethasone/Metilprednisolone), monoclonal antibodies (Anakinra/Tocilizumab), antibiotics (Azytromicine), and anticoagulants (Enoxaparine). Primary outcome variables were the following: (a) clinical (O(2) saturation and O(2) supply); (b) biochemical (lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological Taylors scale. Secondary outcome variables were the following: (a) hospitalization length of stay, (b) mortality rate. RESULTS: At baseline, ozone/SOC groups were not different on age, comorbidities, O(2) saturation, and O(2) supply. Patients in the ozone group improved O(2) saturation and decrease O(2) supply. SOC maintained O(2) saturation and required more O(2) supply. Lymphocyte count improved only in the ozone group and with statistical difference (p<0.05). Biomarkers of inflammation (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, LDH, CRP, and IL-6) decreased in both groups, but only significantly in favor of the ozone group (p<0.05). Ferritin showed a significant decrease in the ozone group but an increase on the SOC group. Radiological pneumonitis decreased on both groups but the decrease was only significant in the ozone group (p<0.0001).

In a multivariant analysis the variables significantly associated to mortality were the presence of cardiopathy (CI 95% OR 2,58-67,07), levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L (CI 95% OR 1,52-46,00), and age&#8805;65 years (CI 95% OR 1,23-44,62). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiopathy, levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L and age &#8805;65 years are associated with a higher risk of death during hospital stay for COVID-19.

The AIDS epidemic will not end if the needs of people living with HIV and the determinants of health are not being addressed. Compared to HIV individuals without depression, depressed HIV individuals have worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality risk. Depression is caused by a complex combination of social, psychological, and biological variables. This systematic review, thereby motivated by the need to address this gap in the literature, aims to articulate determinants of depression among MSM living with HIV according to the biopsychosocial approach. METHODOLOGY: We systematically searched four databases from 2011 to 2021. We searched for observational studies on determinants of depression among MSM living with HIV. The outcome is depression based on the categorical or numerical outcome. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study risks of bias. Any disagreements are consulted with the third reviewer. RESULTS: We identified 533 articles, of which only eight studies are included. A total of 3,172 MSMs are included in the studies. We found the determinants of depression and categorized them according to biological, psychological, and social approaches. CONCLUSION: The determinants of depression with the strongest evidence across studies were enacted HIV-related stigma, unemployment, sleep disturbance, current smoker, black ethnicity, born overseas, ART initiation, and access to mental health care. Despite weaker evidence, the other relevant determinants to be included were older age, internalized stigma, self-efficacy, and social support. Efforts to improve or prevent depression among MSM living with HIV could benefit from addressing the determinants of depression based on the biopsychosocial approach immediately after HIV diagnosis. Integrating mental health screening and care into HIV treatment settings would strengthen HIV prevention and care outcomes and improve access to mental healthcare.","output":"Biopsychosocial approach to understanding determinants of depression among men who have sex with men living with HIV: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led health care providers to shift rapidly from on-site consultation towards teleconsultation. However, knowledge about patient satisfaction with teleconsultation, particularly for mental health care, is limited and demands further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction with teleconsultation in mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed to identify the leading contributing factors to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. A convenience sampling method was employed. An online survey was conducted between June 8 and August 3, 2020. A 14-item questionnaire was used to assess the patient's level of satisfaction in four domains of satisfaction. A total of 106 questionnaires were received. Respondents reported a high level of satisfaction with teleconsultation. The convenience of not having to travel to the health center for consultation was the leading contributing factor to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. However, patients reported that they were least satisfied with teleconsultation because they could not express their feelings deeply to the provider. The current study provides preliminary evidence that teleconsultation may be a satisfactory mode of communication during the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health care in Malaysia. Most importantly, consultation in mental health care should carry on to be performed remotely to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Future research is warranted to provide a better understanding of other factors contributing to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation and ways to improve them. ? 2021, Malaysian Journal of Public Health Medicine.

RESULTS: For SARS-CoV-2, positive children <15 years of age represented 3.4% (228/6,735) of all positive cases, which is significantly less than for endemic coronaviruses (46.1%; 533/1,156; p < 0.001). Among 10,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses in 2020, children <15 years represented a significantly lower proportion of all positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 than for endemic coronaviruses [2.2% (24/1,067) vs 33.5% (149/445), respectively; p < 0.001]. Epidemic curves for endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in 91,722 patients showed comparable bell-shaped distributions with a slight time lag. In contrast, age distribution of endemic coronaviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses differed very significantly compared to that of SARS-CoV2, which was the only virus to spare children.

This is a brief comparative review of the biology of coronaviral infections emphasizing the commonalities among the various members of the family and considering how the veterinary experience with coronaviruses can inform the response to SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are perhaps best viewed as mutation machines whose genetic sequences can readily change through genetic drift, recombination, and deletions from a large genome. However, to be of clinical concern, variants must have the perfect set of amino acids in the S protein receptor binding domain and in their replication-mediating nonstructural proteins.

RESULTS: Nine patients (22.5%) died during the study and 16 patients (40%) were admitted to ICU. Deceased patients demonstrated lower amounts of T cell count and CD4+ T cell count (with a marginal difference (p = 0.07)) compared with survived patients at the time of admission. The chance of mortality was significantly higher for patients with CD7 loss (OR = 14.89). A marginally significant relationship was also indicated between CD4<200/ml and mortality (OR = 8.65), but no other significant relationships were observed between variables and ICU admission.

Septoria tritici blotch was the most prevalent and severe foliar disease each year, although annual levels fluctuated considerably and there was no overall significant change over the two decades. Incidence of brown rust, yellow rust, take\\\\all, and barley yellow dwarf virus also showed no significant overall change during the survey period, whereas glume blotch, powdery mildew, eyespot, and sharp eyespot all showed significant decline.

It is urgent to develop a novel candidate against TGEV entry. Bacillus subtilis is a probiotic with excellent anti-microorganism properties and one of its secretions, surfactin, has been regarded as a versatile weapon for most plant pathogens, especially for the enveloped virus. We demonstrate for the first time that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can effectively inhibit one animal coronavirus, TGEV, entering the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Then, several different experiments were performed to seek the might mechanisms. The plaque assays showed that surfactant could reduce the plaque generation of TGEV in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, after incubation with TGEV for 1.5 h, B. subtilis could attach TGEV particles to their surface so that the number of virus to bind to the host cells was declined. Furthermore, our data showed that the inhibition of B. subtilis was closely related to the competition with TGEV for the viral entry receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and aminopeptidase N (APN) protein. In addition, Western blotting and apoptosis analysis indicated that B. subtilis could enhance the resistance of IPEC-J2 cells by up-regulating the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-6 and reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells. Taken together, our results suggest that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can antagonize TGEV entry in vitro and may serve as promising new candidates for TGEV prevention.","output":"Bacillus subtilis and surfactin inhibit the transmissible gastroenteritis virus from entering the intestinal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 is associated with high mortality.

Randomization and stratification by ARDS severity was used to foster balance among groups. Participants received two intravenous infusions of 100x106 UC-MSC, or vehicle, at day 0 and 3. The primary endpoint was safety, defined by occurrence of pre-specified infusion associated adverse events, along with adverse events during 28 day follow-up. All subjects were analyzed under an intention to treat design. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included survival at 28 days and time to recovery.Findings: 24 subjects (12 per group) were recruited between April 25 and July 21 2020. At 28 days post last infusion, patient survival was 91% and 42% in the UC-MSC and Control groups, respectively (p=0.015). No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed related to UC-MSC infusions. There was no observed difference in number of subjects experiencing infusion-associated adverse events.

Six themes, each related to nurse wellbeing, depicted: (i) value and sense of purpose from nursing, yet also negative consequences of losing sight of oneself within the nursing role; (ii) work nurses did to disengage from their job and create a balance within their life; (iii) significance of the team and senior team as a source of both strength and opportunity for wellbeing; (iv) a range of wellbeing initiatives with a perception these were often developed, and for use, in response to crisis as opposed to preventative or proactive measures; (v) value of additional nurse wellbeing education and promotion of available support; and (vi) novel challenges and ways to wellbeing during times where resources were stretched and usual support systems impacted. DISCUSSION: Identified positive and negative consequences of nursing must be addressed when developing targeted wellbeing interventions. CONCLUSION: New ways of working and supporting individual, team and organisational wellbeing are needed for flourishing working environments. Potential strategies to either leverage or mitigate the positive and negative consequences of nursing are offered.","output":"Nurse wellbeing during the coronavirus (2019) pandemic: A qualitative descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of online reviews on consumers intention to visit restaurants, with the moderating role of involvement.Design/methodology/approachThe research framework was built on signaling theory, message appeals and involvement theory. To test the proposed framework, three experiments were conducted online with real customer samples. T-tests, ANOVA and SPSS PROCESS macro were used for data analysis.FindingsThe results revealed that online reviews with higher online ratings and emotional appeal led to higher restaurant visit intention. Review appeal significantly moderated the effect of online ratings on restaurant visit intention. Customers with low restaurant involvement were more impacted by emotional comments than by functional comments.Research limitations/implicationsThe present study extends our knowledge on the effects of online reviews moderated by levels of customer involvement. By combining signaling theory with involvement theory, it adds value to the literature on customer online behavior, especially in the foodservice context. The present study has limitations that might provide opportunities for future research. It used evaluations (TripAdvisor scores) and only positive reviews (texts), so customers intentions considering negative reviews could not be examined. The level of hedonism concerning consumption in restaurants and prior knowledge regarding restaurant reviews was not controlled for. It is possible that the level of hedonism perceived and prior review knowledge may moderate the customers intention to visit the restaurant.Practical implicationsThe present study shows the importance of online comments for the promotion of restaurants that have low evaluation scores. It is essential that restaurant owners and managers encourage potential customers by using comments to elaborate on their marketing strategies and promotion. At the same time, they should invite customers to share their emotional experiences, and not just their views on service efficiency (a functional aspect). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the internet and mobile devices has become more prominent. Managers could therefore use emotional messages on the restaurants website or apps to attract customers with low restaurant involvement. Also, a system to identify the involvement of customers with restaurants could be implemented online or on mobile devices to present specific messages. The present study also recommends the use of online tools as virtual tours, photographs taken from different angles, smiling faces, floor plans and sittings and pre-determined emotional expressions. Also, the restaurant could promote lives on cooking different dishes to motive customers interaction and comments. These would help to increase customers visit intentions.Originality/valueThis study extends knowledge about the effect of restaurant online reviews (both ratings and appeals) moderated by the level of customer involvement. The present study also adds value to the customer online behavior literature showing that customers with low involvement are more sensitive to emotional content as they use the affective route to process information rather than the central route.","output":"The effect of online reviews on restaurant visit intentions: applying signaling and involvement theories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The situation of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still severe at present In order to better fight against the epidemic and give full play to the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, we explored the feasibility of acupuncture therapy in the intervention of COVID-19 through analyzing the relevant literature in both ancient and modern time Additionally, we analyzed the intervention scheme of acupuncture for COVID-19 developed by China Association of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and supplemented the protocol of the intervention with auricular acupuncture It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19 During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early","output":"[Feasibility analysis on acupuncture therapy for the treatment of Corona Virus Disease 2019 and the exploration on the application scheme]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study was to investigate the practice and habits of physical exercise impact due to COVID-19 social isolation before and during the outbreak in Brazil and its mains macro-regions, which have social and economic disparities. METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study through an online questionnaire survey. A self-administered survey (PEF-COVID19) was applied in the Brazilian general population, age  18 years. T-test for independent samples and Chi-square tests were used to compare Brazil and different macro-regions, p<0.05. RESULTS: 1,977 participants filled the survey and 1,845 were included; 80% of the included ones were in social isolation. In general, the self-related physical exercise practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise characteristics were highly affected by the pandemic (p<0.05). Sedentary behavior increased significantly (14.9 vs. 29.8%) and between the active ones, the frequency of PEx per week and duration of the PEx practice decreased significantly. The motivation to exercise also changed considering performance and health before and during the pandemic, respectively (10 vs. 5.6% and 72.4 vs. 79.1%). Also, the sample started to exercise less in the night and more in the afternoon, respectively (33.7 vs. 25.3% and 19.1 vs. 31.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic highly influenced the physical exercise practice and habits (frequency, duration, motivation, period to exercise) in Brazil and its main macro-regions.

Methods: We deployed particulate air samplers in rooms with COVID-19 positive patients in hospital ward and ICU rooms, rooms in long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, and a correctional facility experiencing an outbreak. Samplers were placed between 2 and 3 meters from the patient. Aerosol (small liquid particles suspended in air) samples were collected onto gelatin filters by Ultrasonic Personal Air Samplers (UPAS) fitted with <2.5{micro}m (micrometer) and <10{micro}m size-selective inlets operated for 16 hours (total 1.92m3), and with a Coriolis Biosampler over 10 minutes (total 1.5m3). Samples were assayed for viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the viral genome by multiplex PCR using the E and N protein target sequences. We validated the sampling methods by inoculating gelatin filters with viable vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and with three concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, operating personal samplers for 16hrs, and quantifying viable virus recovery by TCID50 assay. Results: In total, 138 samples were collected from 99 rooms. RNA samples were positive in 9.1% (6/66) of samples obtained with the UPAS 2.5{micro}m samplers, 13.5% (7/52) with the UPAS 10{micro}m samplers, and 10.0% (2/20) samples obtained with the Coriolis samplers.

This study aimed to describe the impact of the early phase of the pandemic on physician decision-making, practice patterns, and mental health. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to physician members of the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) on March 24 and April 7, 2020. Respondents provided information regarding changes in clinical volume, treatment, and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4]) before April 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,430 individuals who opened the survey, 260 completed it (18.2%). Overall clinical and procedural volume decreased to 69.6% and 13.0% of prepandemic volume, respectively. Mean in-person clinic visits were reduced to 17.7% of total prepandemic clinic volume. Ongoing clinical visits were predominantly completed via telemedicine (video) or telephone (74.5%), rather than in-person (25.5%). Telemedicine and telephone visits represented 24.6% and 27.3% of prepandemic clinical volume, respectively. Respondents decreased in-person visits of select groups of high-risk patients by 85.8-94.6%. Significantly more providers reported increasing rather than decreasing prescriptions of the following medications: opioids (28.8% vs 6.2% of providers, P < 0.001), muscle relaxants (22.3% vs 5.4%, P < 0.001), neuropathic pain medications (29.6% vs 3.8%, P < 0.001), and acetaminophen (26.2% vs 4.2%, P < 0.001).

Seven area-specific workplace measures were assessed using a self-report 23-item scale at the 2nd follow-up. Psychological distress was measured using an 18-item scale of the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire at each survey. Linear regressions and mixed model analysis were conducted of psychological distress at follow-ups on scores of the area-specific workplace measures, adjusting for psychological distress and other covariates at the 1st survey. RESULTS: A total of 941 employees responded at baseline; most of them (86.9-90.9%) participated in the follow-up surveys. Linear regression analysis indicated that workplace measures of facilitating employees' preventive measures (ie, hygiene behaviors) statistically significantly and negatively correlated with psychological distress at the 5th survey [b=-0.518, standard error (SE) 0.259, P=0.046].

The purpose of this study was to collect data on COVID-19 knowledge, behaviours, and attitudes as an illness, as well as COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: In October 2021, a cross-sectional research with 232 participants was undertaken. A standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data.

Social media, news media, and news papers are the most effective sources of information on COVID-19, reaching 34.48% of the population. Basic COVID-19 knowledge was reported to be moderate. Nearly half of the respondents (48.3%) thought SARSCOV-2 was man-made, while 36.21% were unsure. Good preventive behaviours were indicated by 49.14% of subjects. Overall, we find that around 65% of people are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Male gender, low education, and occupation (teachers, health care workers, and students) were shown to be more hesitant about vaccination. In this study, healthcare workers (HCWs) were averse to get COVID-19 vaccine.

The existing literature is limited. Methods: Aerosols and splatter were generated from an ultrasonic scaling procedure on a dental mannequin and characterized by two optical imaging methods - digital inline holography (DIH) and laser sheet imaging (LSI). Capture efficiencies of various aerosol mitigation devices were evaluated and compared. Results: The ultrasonic scaling procedure generates a wide size range of aerosols up to a few hundred micrometers and occasional large splatter which emit at low velocity (mostly below 3 m/s). Use of a saliva ejector (SE) and high-volume evacuator (HVE) resulted in 63% and 88% of overall reduction respectively while an extraoral local extractor (ELE) resulted in a reduction of 96% at the nominal design flow setting. Conclusions: The study results showed that the use of ELE or HVE significantly reduced aerosol and splatter emission. The use of HVE generally requires an additional person to assist a hygienist, while an ELE can be operated hands-free when a dental hygienist is performing ultrasonic scaling and other operations.

SARS-CoV-2 infection, that causes COVID-19, triggers overproduction of interferon-gamma (IFNG), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. IFNG activates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO), enzyme that catalyzes Trp conversion into Kyn, and enzymes of down-stream Kyn pathway that catalyze Kyn conversion into 3-hydroxykynurenine, kynurenic and anthranilic acids in brain and peripheral organs. We reviewed data on SARS-CoV-2 - IFNG C induced changes of peripheral Trp C Kyn pathway, considering their translational potential for personalized psychiatric care. Elevated blood levels of Trp C Kyn pathway metabolites were correlated with the severity of symptoms and predicted the negative outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Association of Trp C Kyn pathway up-regulation with psychiatric complication in non-COVID-19 patients suggests that activation of these pathways contribute to the mechanism(s) of COVID-19 associated psychiatric conditions as well. Increased risk of psychiatric complications in carriers of T (high producer) allele of polymorphic IFNG gene and elevation of serum levels of Kyn and its metabolites in interferon-alpha treated hepatitis C virus patients provides further support for such a suggestion. Assessment of blood levels of Kyn and its metabolites, and polymorphism of Trp C Kyn pathway genes might be developed into personalized biological markers predicting gender/aging dependent individuals risk of psychiatric complications in COVID-19 patients.

While healthcare systems around the world are faced with increasing costs, branded and generic drug companies are facing the challenge of creating market differentiators. Two of the problems associated with the partial or complete loss of response to chronic medications are a lack of adherence and compensatory responses to chronic drug administration, which leads to tolerance and loss of effectiveness. Approach and Results: First-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems do not address these needs and suffer from a low adoption rate by patients and clinicians. Second-generation AI systems are focused on a single subject and on improving patients clinical outcomes. The digital pill, which combines a personalized second-generation AI system with a branded or generic drug, improves the patient response to drugs by increasing adherence and overcoming the loss of response to chronic medications. By improving the effectiveness of drugs, the digital pill reduces healthcare costs and increases end-user adoption. The digital pill also provides a market differentiator for branded and generic drug companies. Conclusions: Implementing the use of a digital pill is expected to reduce healthcare costs, providing advantages for all the players in the healthcare system including patients, clinicians, healthcare authorities, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers. The described business model for the digital pill is based on distributing the savings across all stakeholders, thereby enabling improved global health.","output":"Improving Global Healthcare and Reducing Costs Using Second-Generation Artificial Intelligence-Based Digital Pills: A Market Disruptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 tends to cause more severe disease in patients with COPD once they are infected. We aimed to investigate the rates of influenza, pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccination uptake in patients with COPD and to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread vaccination against COVID-19 had any impact on the intention to accept influenza vaccines in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center and cross-sectional survey in seven tertiary hospitals in Beijing and consecutively recruited outpatients with COPD from June 1st to July 30th, 2021. The survey included patients clinical characteristics, uptake of influenza, pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine knowledge, attitude towards vaccines, and the change of intention to receive influenza vaccination after COVID-19 epidemic and COVID-19 vaccination in Beijing. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were enrolled. The rate of COVID-19 vaccination during the study period was 39.0%. The rates of influenza vaccination in the past season and pneumococcal vaccination in the past year were 22.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Of the patients who had not received COVID-19 vaccination (n = 161), only 16.2% reported that COVID-19 vaccination was recommended by clinicians, while 23.5% had no knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccination. About 51.1% of the patients reported that their intention to receive influenza vaccination was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination was independently associated with a positive change in intention to receive influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The coverage rate of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with COPD in Beijing was 39.0%, and that of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was very low. The COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccination campaign showed a significant, positive impact on patients with COPD in terms of influenza vaccination.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through droplets, fomites, aerosol and fecal-oral route, while there is no strong evidence as yet, supporting transplacental transmission. Professor Papaevangelou highlights the epidemiological differences between seasonal influenza and COVID-19 and accepts that school closure had no direct impact since children are not the main transmitters of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, social distancing clearly limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, while quarantine seemed necessary during the first wave of this pandemic. She refers to antivirals, as well as other therapeutic agents able to diminish the immune response producing multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which is associated with increased mortality, and she notes that these agents were rarely used in children with COVID-19, while in most cases supportive treatment sufficed.

Therefore, the need for routine COVID-19 testing in this population was evaluated. Between 1st August and 30th October 2020, 150 cancer patients were included. Symptoms of COVID-19 infection were evaluated. All eligible individuals went through RT-PCR and serological tests for COVID-19. At the same time, 920 non-cancer patients were recruited from a random sample of individuals who were subject to routine molecular and anti-body screening tests. Of 150 cancer patients, 7 (4.7%) were RT-PCR positive. Comorbidity made a significant difference in the RT-PCR positivity of cancer patients, 71.4% positive versus 25.8% negative (P-value = 0.02). The average age for negative and positive groups was 53.3 and 58.2 respectively (P-value = 0.01). No significant difference was observed between cancer and non-cancer patients regarding COVID-19 antibody tests. However, cancer patients were 3 times less likely to have a positive RT-PCR test result OR = 0.33 (CI: 0.15C0.73).

There is insufficient data comparing the impact of intubation versus NIV on patient-centered outcomes of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause 30-day mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who underwent intubation first, intubation after NIV, or NIV only. DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients admitted in March and April of 2020. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Brooklyn, New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Adult COVID-19 confirmed patients who required ventilator support (non-invasive ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation) at discretion of treating physician, were included. EXPOSURES: Patients were categorized into three exposure groups: intubation-first, intubation after NIV, or NIV-only. PRIMARY OUTCOME: 30-day all-cause mortality, a predetermined outcome measured by multivariable logistic regression. Data are presented with medians and interquartile ranges, or percentages with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Covariates for the model were age, sex, qSOFA score &#8805; 2, presenting oxygen saturation, vasopressor use, and greater than three comorbidities. A secondary multivariable model compared mortality of all patients that received NIV (intubation after NIV and NIV-only) with the intubation-first group. RESULTS: A total of 222 were enrolled. Overall mortality was 77.5% (95%CI, 72-83%). Mortality for intubation-first group was 82% (95%CI, 73-89%; 75/91), for Intubation after NIV was 84% (95%CI, 70-92%; 37/44), and for NIV-only was 69% (95%CI, 59-78%; 60/87). In multivariable analysis, NIV-only was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95%CI, 0.13-0.69). No difference in mortality was observed between intubation-first and intubation after NIV. Secondary analysis found all patients who received NIV to have lower mortality than patients who were intubated only (OR: 0.44, 95%CI, 0.21-0.95).

Pre-ASCT mobilization chemotherapy for MM, vinorelbine and high dose cyclophosphamide (VC), has been historically given in the inpatient (IP) setting. Due to rising bed occupancy rates and patients' preferences for treatment in the ambulatory setting, our team has offered eligible patients an option to receive VC outpatient (OP) since 2018. Our study aims to audit the feasibility and safety of this initiative, and review potential healthcare-related cost savings. Methods Eligibility criteria for OP chemotherapy were developed by a multidisciplinary team based on patients' age, functional status, medical comorbidities and social factors (Figure 1). The chemotherapy regimen was modified for an OP setting (Figure 2), of which the main alteration involved changing the route of administration of intravenous (IV) mesna to a combination of IV and oral. A retrospective review was conducted for 35 MM patients (18 IP and 17 OP) who received VC for mobilisation at our center from 2018 to 2019. The patient characteristics were similar between the two groups (Table 1). Patient data were analyzed from the day of admission for VC (IP) or day 1 of VC (OP), to the day before admission for stem cell harvesting. Clinical charts were reviewed for unexpected complications and unplanned admissions. Costs incurred were calculated using the value-driven-outcome (VDO) informatics analysis of the hospital. Results There were no unexpected clinical complications or unplanned admissions in both groups. The median length of hospital stay for the IP cohort was 3 days, amounting to a saving of 51 hospital days over 2 years in the OP cohort. Median costs were 73% lower in the OP cohort (Figure 3). The difference was mainly due to certain costs not incurred in the OP setting. These included room charges and daily treatment fees (which accounted for an average of 46% and 19% of IP charges respectively). Investigation costs were also 55% lower in the OP cohort, which could be attributed to more investigations being performed in the IP setting such as screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and nonurgent radiographs ordered after hours by the on-call physician upon admission. Conclusions Our findings show that OP mobilization chemotherapy for MM is safe, feasible and associated with improved bed utilization and cost savings. Other components of the stem cell transplantation process are also increasingly being transitioned from the IP to OP setting in our center as part of an ongoing paradigm shift in right-siting treatment services, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic's strain on inpatient capacity. These results provide an affirmation of our efforts to optimize the utilization of healthcare resources.

As concerns the risks of COVID-induced disease, published data show that pregnant women who develop COVID-19 have fewer symptoms than patients who are not pregnant, but they are more likely to need hospitalization in intensive care, and neonatal morbidity. Aim of the present perspective paper is to analyze the current literature regarding the use of the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, in terms of safety and protection, in high risk pregnant women as those affected by diabetes and obesity. METHODS: Analysis of literature about vaccination against COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. RESULTS: The main health organizations and international scientific societies, emphasize thatalthough data regarding the use of COVID vaccines during pregnancy and lactation are still lackingvaccination should not be contraindicated. It should be considered for pregnant women at high risk of exposure to COVID-19. For such women, the potential benefits and risks should be assessed by the healthcare professionals caring for them. A recent prospective study to test the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA in pregnant and lactating women, has showed that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination triggers a robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women; there was also evidence of an immune transfer to their newborn. CONCLUSIONS: We urgently need data on the effect of COVID-19 vaccination, in terms of maternal and fetal outcomes and vaccine related symptoms in high risk women during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is important to run campaigns to promote vaccination, in particular in pregnant women at high risk to have severe COVID infection as those diabetics and/or obese.","output":"Vaccination against COVID-19 infection: the need of evidence for diabetic and obese pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The rare incidence of esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and limited treatment experience result in insufficient clinical observations and unsuitable guidelines for its management.

The clinical features and image characteristics were recorded accordingly. Univariate survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and multivariate analysis was carried out with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS The multivariate analysis performed using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS). The hazard ratios (HRs) of N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement (mild vs moderate/marked) for OS were 0.426 (P = 0.024), 3.862 (P = 0.006), and 2.169/0.809 (P = 0.037), respectively. The HR of adjuvant chemotherapy for PFS was 6.432 (P < 0.001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with degree of enhancement (P = 0.018).

We evaluated the impact of service suspension on backlog, recovery strategy, infection control policy, results of pre-procedure Covid-19 testing, and 7/14-day post-procedure Covid-19 symptom screening.Results937 elective procedures were cancelled between 23 March and June 2020. A vetting tool linked to the booking system was used to categorise these as High-risk 2-week wait (n=57), Defer 3 months (n=439), Defer 6 months (n=300), Defer 12 months (n=9), Surveillance (n=45), Discharge back to referrer (n=87). Elective procedures restarted on 8 June 2020. Lists were initially booked with 50% reduction in volume compared to pre-Covid-19, to accommodate PPE, downtime and social distancing. We increased endoscopy administration from 2 to 5 staff, to implement 7-day pre-procedure SCOTS criteria telephone screening, 3-day pre-procedure Covid-19 PCR testing, and 7/14-day post-procedure telephone follow-up. We introduced outpatient information leaflet and consent forms regarding Covid-19 risk. Inpatient endoscopy was carried out in the operating theatre until the end of August. On 17 July we removed downtime after lower GI endoscopy increasing capacity. Twice weekly evening lists resumed in August, with an extra evening list added in September. From 1 August until 10 October we used insourcing at weekend. We trialed outsourcing of 2 weekly lists for 4 weeks in August, but did not find this strategy effective. Additional Saturday and evening lists were performed by 6 endoscopists removed from the GIM rota.

The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS: We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB.","output":"Evaluation of digital PCR assay in detection of M.tuberculosis IS6110 and IS1081 in tuberculosis patients plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related technologies have played an active role in the prevention and control of novel coronaviruses at home and abroad, especially in epidemic pre-vention, surveillance, and elimination.

Based on the convolution neural network and deep learning technology, the system possesses a crowd density detection method and a face mask detection method, which can detect the position of dense crowds. Intelligent voice alarm technology was used to achieve an intelligent alarm system for abnormal situations, such as crowd-gathering areas and people without masks, and to carry out intelligent dissemination of epidemic prevention policies, which provides a powerful technical means for epidemic prevention and de-laying their spread. To verify the superiority and feasibility of the system, high\\\\precision online analysis was carried out for the crowd in the inspection area, and pedestrians faces were detected on the ground to identify whether they were wearing a mask. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the crowd density detection was less than 8.4, and the mean av-erage precision (mAP) of face mask detection was 61.42%. The system can provide convenient and accurate evaluation information for decision\\\\makers and meets the requirements of real\\\\time and accurate detection. ? 2021 by the authors.

Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS: We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up.

Clinical research often requires extra encounters with patients, is costly, takes place in an artificial situation with a biased selection of patients, and entails long delays until new evidence is implemented into health care. Electronic health records (EHR) contain detailed information on real patients and cover the entirety of patients. However, the use of EHR for research is limited because they are not standardized between hospitals. This leads to disproportionate amounts of work for extracting data of interest and frequently data are incomplete and of poor quality. Aims SwissPedData aims to lay the foundation for a paediatric learning health system in Switzerland by facilitating EHR-based research. In this project, we aimed to assess the way routine clinical data are currently recorded in large paediatric clinics in Switzerland and to develop a national EHR-based common data model (CDM) that covers all processes of routine paediatric care in hospitals. Methods A taskforce of paediatricians from large Swiss children's hospitals reviewed the current status of routine data documentation in paediatric clinical care and the extent of digitalization. We then used a modified Delphi method to reach a broad consensus on a national EHR-based CDM. Results All Swiss children's hospitals use EHR to document some or all aspects of care. 119 paediatricians, representing eight hospitals and all paediatric subspecialties, participated in an extended Delphi process to create SwissPedData. The group agreed on a national CDM that comprises a main module with general paediatric data and sub-modules relevant to paediatric subspecialties. The data dictionary includes 336 common data elements (CDEs): 76 in the main module on general paediatrics and between 11 and 59 CDEs per subspecialty module. Among these, 266 were classified as mandatory, 52 as recommended and 18 as optional. Conclusion SwissPedData is a CDM for information to be collected in EHR of Swiss children's hospitals. It covers all care processes including clinical and paraclinical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, disposition and care site. All participating hospitals agreed to implement SwissPedData in their clinical routine and clinic information systems. This will pave the way for a national paediatric learning health system in Switzerland that enables fast and efficient answers to urgent clinical questions by facilitating high-quality nationwide retrospective and prospective observational studies and recruitment of patients for nested prospective studies and clinical trials.","output":"SwissPedData: Standardising hospital records for the benefit of paediatric research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of cyanation chemistry at manufacturing scales using batch equipment can be challenging because of the hazardous nature of the reagents employed and the tight control of reaction parameters, including cryogenic temperatures, that help to afford acceptable selectivity and conversion for the desired reaction Application of continuous flow chemistry offers a means to mitigate the risk associated with handling large amounts of hazardous reagents and to better control the reaction parameters A case study describing the cyanation of a glycoside using continuous flow chemistry toward the synthesis of the drug candidate remdesivir is presented","output":"Development of a Large-Scale Cyanation Process Using Continuous Flow Chemistry En Route to the Synthesis of Remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) is a pressure controlled intermittent mandatory mode of ventilation characterized by prolonged inspiratory time and high mean airway pressure. Several studies have demonstrated that APRV can improve oxygenation and lung recruitment in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Although most patients with COVID-19 meet the Berlin criteria for ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 may differ from traditional ARDS as patients often present with severe, refractory hypoxemia and significant variation in respiratory system compliance. To date, no studies investigating APRV in this patient population have been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of APRV as a rescue mode of ventilation in critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with a trial of APRV for refractory hypoxemia. PaO(2)/FIO(2) (P/F ratio), ventilatory ratio and ventilation outputs before and during APRV were compared. RESULTS: APRV significantly improved the P/F ratio and decreased FIO(2) requirements. PaCO(2) and ventilatory ratio were also improved. There was an increase in tidal volume per predicted body weight during APRV and a decrease in total minute ventilation. On multivariate analysis, higher inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I: E) and airway pressure were associated with greater improvement in P/F ratio. CONCLUSIONS: APRV may improve oxygenation, alveolar ventilation and CO(2) clearance in patients with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia.

The joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs, but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented. Development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug.

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of 2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29C2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80C4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80C7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data.

While several studies have evaluated vaping effects on the lungs and heart; effects on the gastrointestinal tract remain unknown. Using established murine models of acute (1 week) and chronic (3 month) daily e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, both with nicotine-containing and vehicle control e-liquids, murine colon transcriptomics and organoid co-culture models, we assessed the effects of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and mucosal health. Histologic analyses revealed that chronic exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols induced mucosal inflammation. Transcriptome analyses revealed that chronic, but not acute, nicotine-free e-cigarette use significantly reduced expression of tight junction markers, including occluding, and drove expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of murine and human enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols alone, or in co-culture with invasive E. coli, confirmed that repetitive exposure was sufficient to recapitulate the key findings observed in vivo, i.e., barrier-disruption, downregulation of occludin, inflammation, and an accentuated risk of and response to bacterial infection. These data highlight an unexpected harmful effect of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and pinpoint non-nicotine chemical components common across >90% of e-cigarette e-liquids as the source of harm. Given the ever-expanding importance of the integrity of the gut barrier for host fitness, and impact of gut mucosal inflammation on a multitude of chronic diseases, these findings are broadly relevant to medicine and public health.

Despite these insights, their impact on the most critical entity that separates trillions of microbes from the largest immune system in our body, i.e., the gut barrier, remains unexplored. Using a combination of mouse models, gut transcriptomics, and murine and human gut-derived organoids, here we show that chronic exposure to aerosols of electronic-cigarette disrupts the gut barrier, increases its susceptibility to bacterial infections and triggers inflammation. Given the importance of the gut barrier in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, these findings provide valuable insights into the potential long-term harmful effects of electronic cigarettes on health.","output":"E-cigarettes compromise the gut barrier and trigger gut inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chains from a cohort of 31 COVID-19 patients from the UK reveals a stereotypical naive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which is consistent across patients.

We aim to quantify the characteristics of the profunda femoris and its relation to patency following aortoiliac inflow procedures. METHODS: Patients undergoing aortoiliac inflow procedures between 2009 and 2019 were identified. These were classified into aorto-bifemoral bypass (ABF), extra-anatomic bypass (EAB), femoral endarterectomy (FEA) and iliac stenting. Preoperative imaging characteristics of the profunda femoris were reviewed as well as outcomes. RESULTS: We performed 269 procedures in 202 patients. 162 were men (59.8%) with a mean age of 61 (SD 11.45). 123 patients (45.3%) presented with claudication, 69 (25.9%) with critical limb ischemia and 30 (11.2%) with acute limb ischemia. 50 patients (18.6%) underwent ABF, 44 (16.4%) underwent EAB, 57 (21.2%) underwent FEA and 158 (58.7%) underwent iliac stenting. 14 patients (5.2%) underwent FEA plus iliac stenting. 52 patients (19.2%) had an occluded superficial femoral artery. 24 patients (8.9%) had additional outflow procedures performed during the index operation; including infrainguinal endovascular intervention in 10 patients (3.7%), infrainguinal bypass in 10 (3.7%) and femoropopliteal thrombectomy in 5 (1.9%). Mean follow-up was 17.5 months with overall 2-year primary patency (PP) of 79%. 2-year PP was 94.7% for FEA, 85.6% for ABF, 79.8% for iliac stents, 62.5% for EAB. Unadjusted analysis revealed that loss of primary assisted patency was associated with active smoking (67.6% vs 48.6% p=0.035), lower creatinine (Mean 0.84 vs 1.06, p=0.003), critical limb ischemia versus claudication (37.8% vs 21.4%, p=0.037) and profunda femoris with fewer than 5 branches >2mm in size (88.2% vs 68.5%, p=0.011). Multivariate analysis confirmed that a profunda with 5 or more branches >2mm in diameter was significantly associated with a lower risk of thrombosis (OR 0.30, p = 0.034). Size of the profunda greater than 6mm approached statistical significance on univariate analysis (35% of the non-thrombosed vs 21% in the thrombosed, p=0.073), but did not significantly affect risk of thrombosis on the multivariate analysis (OR 0.58, p = 0.25). The 2-year PP when all operations were considered was 76% compared to 72% for profunda with fewer than 5 branches > 2mm. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic characteristics of the profunda are associated with patency of inflow procedures. Care should be taken to assess the main profunda and branch diameters on preoperative imaging. A concomitant infrainguinal procedure should be considered in cases of profunda with inadequate large branches, to ensure long-term patency of the inflow operation.","output":"Importance of the Profunda Femoris upon Patency Following Aortoiliac Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Community Oncology Unit (COU) in Nazareth, Israel, provides complete medical treatments to patients who live in the rural area of the country.

Methods: Adolescent athletes in Wisconsin were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in May 2020 while schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PHQ-9, PFABS and PedsQL scores were compared with historical data (HD) of Wisconsin adolescent athletes (N = 5,231) collected during normal school and sport operations in the years 2016-2018. Results: A total of 3,243 (58% female, Age = 16.1+1.2 yrs., grades 9 - 12) participated in the study. May 2020 participants reported higher (worse) PHQ-9 scores than the HD participants (mean: 8.0 (95%CI: 7.8, 8.2) vs 3.3 (3.1, 3.5), p < 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depression (32.9% vs 9.7%, p < 0.001).

Our objective was to validate supervised methods for automatic detection of RT using only airway pressure (Paw) and flow. A secondary objective was to describe the magnitude of the efforts generated during RT. METHODS: We developed algorithms for detection of RT using Paw and flow waveforms. Experts having Paw, flow and esophageal pressure (Pes) assessed automatic detection accuracy by comparison against visual assessment. Muscular pressure (Pmus) was measured from Pes during RT, triggered breaths and ineffective efforts. RESULTS: Tracings from 20 hypoxemic patients were used (mean age 65  12 years, 65% male, ICU survival 75%). RT was present in 24% of the breaths ranging from 0 (patients paralyzed or in pressure support ventilation) to 93.3%. Automatic detection accuracy was 95.5%: sensitivity 83.1%, specificity 99.4%, positive predictive value 97.6%, negative predictive value 95.0% and kappa index of 0.87. Pmus of RT ranged from 1.3 to 36.8 cmH(2)0, with a median of 8.7 cmH(2)0.

Thus carbohydrate has been suggested to underly a non-primary function for proteins, such as in relatively non-specific interactions with other carbohydrates or macromolecules, stabilization of protein conformation, or protection from proteolysis. This non-specific concept is consistent with both the general similarity in carbohydrate structure on very diverse glycoproteins and the frequent structural microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains at given sites. The concept is supported in a general sense by the viability of cells whose glycosylation processes have been globally disrupted by mutation or pharmacological inhibitors. In contrast to the above observations, other studies have revealed the existence of specific, selective receptors for discrete oligosaccharide structures on glycoproteins which seem to be important for compartmentalization of the glycoprotein, or the positioning of cells on which the glycoprotein is concentrated. Sometimes multivalency in the carbohydrate-receptor interaction is crucial. There are additional possible roles for carbohydrate in the transduction of information upon binding to a receptor. The possibility of specific roles for carbohydrate is supported by the existence of numerous unique carbohydrate structures, many of which have been detected as glycoantigens by monoclonal antibodies, with unique distributions in developing and differentiated cells. This article attempts to summarize and rationalize the contradictory results. It appears that in general carbohydrate does in fact underlie only roles secondary to a protein's primary function. These secondary roles are simple non-specific ones of protection and stabilization, but often also satisfy the more sophisticated needs of spatial position control and compartmentalization in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. It is suggested that there are advantages, evolutionarily speaking, for the shared use of carbohydrate for non-specific roles and for specific roles primarily as luxury functions to be executed during the processes of cell differentiation and morphogenesis.","output":"Current ideas on the significance of protein glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Perioperative inefficiency can increase cost.

There is little known information about its outcomes in patients with severe renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis. METHODSA retrospective, multicenter study was conducted on patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis that were discharged after treatment for COVID-19 between April 1st and December 31st, 2020. Primary endpoints were the length of stay, mortality, maximum oxygen requirements along with the escalation of care needing mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included change in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition. RESULTSA total of 52 charts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. 14 patients received remdesivir, and 14 patients did not receive remdesivir. The majority of patients were caucasian, female, with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The mean age was 65.33 +14.14 years. All the patients in the remdesivir group received dexamethasone as compared to only 30% of patients in the non-remdesivir group. There was no significant difference in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition between the two groups. Approximately 35% of the patients died, 18% required intensive ventilation, and the mean length of stay was 12.21 days. DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in length of stay, maximum oxygen requirements, or mortality in COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease in the remdesivir group as compared to the non-remdesivir group.

A new questionnaire was proposed (Cronbachs alpha = 0.816), and 309 surveys were collected in people from two Italian regions (53.72% from Emilia-Romagna and 46.28% from Veneto; 62.46% were female and 37.54% were male; and the age range was 46.67  15.45 years). The number of younger people (25 years) who practiced PA increased during lockdown (p < 0.01); in addition, they were more active than people who were 26C35 years old (p < 0.001). The training frequency before COVID-19 was higher in females than males (p = 0.01), and the frequency of weekly PA increased during lockdown in groups aged 26C35 years (p < 0.001).

Employing a grounded theory approach, nine virtual focus groups with 30 Army NPSP home visitors across eight installations were conducted to examine how this rapid shift has impacted their services, practice, and professional role. The present study identified two overarching themes: (1) working with families (e.g., continued engagement with families, increased communication, shifting family needs) and (2) adjusting to telework (e.g., technology, professional collaboration and communication, professional growth). Findings from these focus groups indicated that home visitors were actively engaged with their clients and experienced both challenges and benefits of telehealth. While the rapid transition was a big change, and home visitors missed the face-to-face interactions, they expressed that they were adapting and improving their virtual service delivery with time. Increased concerns regarding families' well-being due to social and physical isolation, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, and grief for losses due to COVID-19, along with the ability to continue connections with these highly mobile families, points to the importance of telehealth as a means to implement parenting programs vital to military family well-being.

The effectiveness of reflection phases for learning to diagnose has mainly been demonstrated for problem-centered instruction with text-based cases, not for simulation-based learning. To close this research gap, we conducted a study on learning history-taking using virtual patients. In this study, we examined the added benefit of including reflection phases on learning to diagnose accurately, the associations between knowledge and learning, and the diagnostic process. METHODS: A sample of N = 121 medical students completed a three-group experiment with a control group and pre- and posttests. The pretest consisted of a conceptual and strategic knowledge test and virtual patients to be diagnosed. In the learning phase, two intervention groups worked with virtual patients and completed different types of reflection phases, while the control group learned with virtual patients but without reflection phases. The posttest again involved virtual patients. For all virtual patients, diagnostic accuracy was assessed as the primary outcome. Current hypotheses were tracked during reflection phases and in simulation-based learning to measure diagnostic process. RESULTS: Regarding the added benefit of reflection phases, an ANCOVA controlling for pretest performance found no difference in diagnostic accuracy at posttest between the three conditions, F(2, 114) = 0.93, p = .398. Concerning knowledge and learning, both pretest conceptual knowledge and strategic knowledge were not associated with learning to diagnose accurately through reflection phases. Learners diagnostic process improved during simulation-based learning and the reflection phases. CONCLUSIONS: Reflection phases did not have an added benefit for learning to diagnose accurately in virtual patients. This finding indicates that reflection phases may not be as effective in simulation-based learning as in problem-centered instruction with text-based cases and can be explained with two contextual differences. First, information processing in simulation-based learning uses the verbal channel and the visual channel, while text-based learning only draws on the verbal channel. Second, in simulation-based learning, serial cue cases are used to gather information step-wise, whereas, in text-based learning, whole cases are used that present all data at once.

The purpose of this review is to elaborate on the mechanisms surrounding hydroxychloroquine. The review is an in-depth analysis of the antimalarial, immunomodulatory, and antiviral mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine, with detailed and novel pictorial explanations. The mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine are related to potential cardiotoxic manifestations and demonstrate potential adverse effects when used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Finally, current literature associated with hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 has been analyzed to interrelate the mechanisms, adverse effects, and use of hydroxychloroquine in the current pandemic. Currently, there is insufficient evidence about the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: 1. HCQ, initially an antimalarial agent, is used as an immunomodulatory agent for managing several autoimmune diseases, for which its efficacy is linked to inhibiting lysosomal antigen processing, MHC-II antigen presentation, and TLR functions. 2. HCQ is generally well-tolerated although severe life-threatening adverse effects including cardiomyopathy and conduction defects have been reported. 3.

It also has a recently established function in the negative regulation of IFN-I signaling. Homozygous STAT2 deficiency is an ultra-rare inborn error of immunity which provides unique insight into the pathologic consequence of STAT2 dysfunction. We report here a novel genetic cause of homozygous STAT2 deficiency with several notable clinical features. The proband presented aged 12 months with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) closely followed by clinical varicella, both occurring within three weeks of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccinations. There was a history of life-threatening influenza A virus (IAV) disease 2 months previously. Genetic investigation uncovered homozygosity for a novel nonsense variant in STAT2 (c. 1999C>T, p. Arg667Ter) that abrogated STAT2 protein expression. Compatible with STAT2 deficiency, dermal fibroblasts from the child demonstrated a defect of interferon-stimulated gene expression and a failure to mount an antiviral state in response to treatment with IFN-I, a phenotype that was rescued by lentiviral complementation by wild type STAT2. This case significantly expands the phenotypic spectrum of STAT2 deficiency. The occurrence of life-threatening influenza, which has not previously been reported in this condition, adds STAT2 to the list of monogenetic causes of this phenotype and underscores the critical importance of IFN-I and IFN-III to influenza immunity. The development of probable vaccine-strain varicella is also a novel occurrence in STAT2 deficiency, implying a role for IFN-I/III immunity in control of attenuated varicella zoster virus in vivo and reinforcing the susceptibility to pathologic effects of live-attenuated viral vaccines in disorders of IFN-I immunity. Finally, the occurrence of HLH in this case reinforces emerging links to hyperinflammation in patients with STAT2 deficiency and other related defects of IFN-I signalinghighlighting an important avenue for further scientific enquiry.","output":"Life-Threatening Influenza, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Probable Vaccine-Strain Varicella in a Novel Case of Homozygous STAT2 Deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has changed health care rapidly and dramatically. OBJECTIVE: To provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on the pandemic's implications for psychiatric practice. METHODS: A rapid literature review was undertaken to identify scientific literature linking psychiatric outcomes and practice changes due to coronavirus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). A structured quality assessment was used to assess those articles reporting quantitative data. RESULTS: Fifty articles were identified for inclusion, but only 12 contained original data. Eleven of those twelve were rated as of weak quality. The literature described psychiatric sequelae of the coronavirus and related public health interventions through cross-sectional surveys among different populations;no studies include diagnostic or functional impairment data. Populations at risk include COVID-19 survivors, health care workers, the elderly, and those with preexisting psychiatric disease. Impacts on psychiatric practice were described, again without data on changes to quality or access of care.

This article examines the measures adopted by European states in order to contain 19th-century cholera pandemics, which took shape through the development of an international maritime quarantine system, based primarily on the implementation of national regulations and local decision-making. This regime was quickly viewed as ineffective and out of step with liberal ideas that urged a laissez-faire approach to public health matters. In its stead, a long-term trend developed towards easing quarantine measures. Nation states supported the internationalisation of the fight against pandemics, which chiefly consisted of externalising quarantine measures to the East in order to eliminate them in Europe. This process was based on a subtle dialectical relationship between the construction of an international public health space and the affirmation of state sovereignty, and continued into the 20th century with the progressive creation of international institutions responsible for advancing global health.","output":"Quarantine, cholera, and international health spaces: Reflections on 19th-century European sanitary regulations in the time of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper takes advantage of a unique dataset with a prospectively longitudinal, nationally representative sample (n = 5,178) that began in 1958 and has information on COVID\\\\19 health status in 2020 to examine the effect of Big Five personality traits on compliance with social distancing requirements and contraction of COVID\\\\19.

This observation suggests functional differences in the motor networks subserving bicycling and walking. However, a direct comparison of brain activity related to bicycling and walking has never been performed, neither in healthy participants nor in patients. Such a comparison could potentially help elucidating the cortical involvement in motor control and the mechanisms through which bicycling ability may be preserved in patients with freezing of gait. The aim of this study was to contrast the cortical oscillatory dynamics involved in bicycling and walking in healthy participants. To this end, EEG and EMG data of 14 healthy participants were analyzed, who cycled on a stationary bicycle at a slow cadence of 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) and walked at 40 strides per minute (spm), respectively. Relative to walking, bicycling was associated with a stronger power decrease in the high beta band (23-35 Hz) during movement initiation and execution, followed by a stronger beta power increase after movement termination. Walking, on the other hand, was characterized by a stronger and persisting alpha power (8-12 Hz) decrease. Both bicycling and walking exhibited movement cycle-dependent power modulation in the 24-40 Hz range that was correlated with EMG activity. This modulation was significantly stronger in walking. The present findings reveal differential cortical oscillatory dynamics in motor control for two types of complex coordinated motor behavior, i.e., bicycling and walking. Bicycling was associated with a stronger sustained cortical activation as indicated by the stronger high beta power decrease during movement execution and less cortical motor control within the movement cycle.

The aim of this study was to examine daily patterns of well-being in pregnant women before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study design was used to monitor pregnant women in their everyday settings. Two cohorts of pregnant women were recruited. In the first wave in January-December 2019, pregnant women with histories of preterm births (gestational weeks 22C36) or late miscarriages (gestational weeks 12C21); and in the second wave between October 2019 and March 2020, pregnant women with histories of full-term births (gestational weeks 37C42) and no pregnancy losses were recruited. The final sample size for this study was 38 pregnant women. The participants continuously used the Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and their heart rate variability, and physical activity and sleep data were collected. Subjective stress, activity and sleep reports were collected using a smartphone application developed for this study. Data between February 12 to April 8, 2020 were included to cover four-week periods before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions.

The aim of this observational study was to characterize the myocardial effects during SARS-CoV-2 infections by echocardiography. RESULTS AND METHODS: An extended echocardiographic image acquisition protocol was performed in 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessing LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation including rotation, twist, and untwisting. Furthermore, LV deformation was analyzed in an age-matched control group of healthy individuals (n = 20). The most prevalent finding was a reduced longitudinal strain observed predominantly in more than one basal LV segment (n = 10/14 patients, 71%). This pattern reminded of a reverse tako-tsubo morphology that is not typical for other viral myocarditis. Additional findings included a biphasic pattern with maximum post-systolic or negative regional radial strain predominantly basal (n = 5/14 patients, 36%); the absence or dispersion of basal LV rotation (n = 6/14 patients, 43%); a reduced or positive regional circumferential strain in more than one segment (n = 7/14 patients, 50%); a net rotation showing late post-systolic twist or biphasic pattern (n = 8/14 patients, 57%); a net rotation showing polyphasic pattern and/or higher maximum net values during diastole (n = 8/14 patients, 57%). CONCLUSION: Myocardial involvement due to SARS-CoV-2-infection was highly prevalent in the present cohorteven in patients with mild symptoms. It appears to be characterized by specific speckle tracking deformation abnormalities in the basal LV segments.

Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be.

After the implementation of the rapid test, the number of routine tests conducted was reduced over the 5-month period, from 13 times a month to 3 times a month. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the rapid test for the detection of respiratory viruses improved the diagnostic efficiency of the laboratory and greatly reduced lead time.","output":"Laboratory Impact of Rapid Molecular Tests used for the Detection of Respiratory Pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The delivery of growth factors using a carrier system presents a promising and innovative tool in tissue engineering and dentistry today. Two of the foremost bioactive factors, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are widely applied using a ceramic scaffold. The aim of this study was to determine the use of hydroxyapatite microcarrier (MC) for dual delivery of osteogenic and angiogenic factors to accelerate hard tissue regeneration during the regenerative process. METHODS Two MCs of different sizes were fabricated by emulsification of gelatin and alpha-tricalcium phosphate (-TCP). The experimental group was divided based on the combination of MC size and growth factors. For investigating the in vitro properties, rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were harvested from bone marrow of the femur and tibia. For in vivo experiments, MC with/without growth factors was applied into the standardized, 5-mm diameter defects, which were made bilaterally on the parietal bone of the rat. The animals were allowed to heal for 8 weeks, and samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-computed tomography and histology. RESULTS Improved proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells was observed with VEGF loaded MC. For osteogenic differentiation, dual growth factors delivered by MC showed higher osteogenic gene expression, alkaline phosphatse production and calcium deposition. The in vivo results revealed statistically significant increase in new bone formation when dual growth factors were delivered by MC. Dual growth factors administered on a calcium phosphate matrix showed significantly enhanced osteogenic potential. CONCLUSION We propose this system has potential clinical utility in providing solutions for craniofacial bone defects, with the added benefit of early availability.","output":"Combined Delivery of Two Different Bioactive Factors Incorporated in Hydroxyapatite Microcarrier for Bone Regeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of COVID-19 positive cases on admission to hospitals is crucial to protect patients and staff at the same time.

METHODS: Three IMLS publicly available data collections were used: State Library Administrative Agency Survey data; State Program Report system; and the Awarded Grants Search portal. Data about health related projects from these two administrative data sources for 36 competitive award projects since 2015 and 143 projects supported via the formula-funded Grants to States Program between 2015-2018 (inclusive) were included. Descriptive statistics about projects with a health and wellness focus were presented within the context of others supported by Grants to States. RESULTS: Competitive projects supported public libraries health resources and built librarians skills to facilitate patron access to health information. The Grants to States program supported 143 projects associated with health undertaken by 29 states plus Puerto Rico between 2015 and 2018. The IMLS $14.4 million investment during this period leveraged an additional $5 million from state and local sources to support health information projects in public libraries. Finally, data from the State Library Administrative Agency Survey showed that in addition to projects that relied on IMLS Grants to States funds, 29 state libraries provided program assistance in health literacy to the public libraries in their jurisdictions in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to a need to determine whether there are ways to collect additional information via IMLSs data systems to further support state and public libraries in meeting patron health information needs.

Cases reported by other countries suggest that long-term and repeated exposure to ketamine may be associated with several risks, including but not limited to hepatobiliary damage. OBJECTIVE: We aimed (1) to characterize the association between repeated administration of ketamine for off-label medical use and hepatobiliary events and (2) to describe recent trends in the use of ketamine across different clinical settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series analysis, utilizing reports identified from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database as well as the medical literature. We included all cases reported through July 2018 describing both repeated exposure to ketamine in a hospital or ambulatory setting and a hepatobiliary adverse event. We excluded cases describing ketamine abuse. We identified adverse hepatobiliary events using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA(?)) and summarized various case characteristics including: patient demographics, route of ketamine administration, dose, time to onset of event, type of event, and pre-existing risk factors for hepatobiliary disease. To assess trends in the demand for ketamine, we used IQVIA, National Sales Perspectives? to provide the nationally estimated number of vials sold for ketamine from the manufacturer to all US channels of distribution from 2013 through 2017. RESULTS: We identified 14 unique cases that met selection criteria with 21 hepatobiliary adverse events including liver enzyme elevation in all cases, biliary dilation with liver cirrhosis (n = 1), biliary dilation with cholangitis (n = 1), and pericholeductal fibrosis (n = 1). Most cases received ketamine for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome or chronic pain. In cases with a reported time to onset, the majority of events occurred within 4 days.

Anti-NP IgG and neutralising antibodies were measured, as well as a panel of infection and inflammation related cytokines. The virus-specific T cell response was determined by IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT and flow cytometry after over-night incubation of PBMCs with pools of selected SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides. ResultsSeven of 17 convalescent subjects had undetectable levels of anti-NP IgG, and a positive correlation was shown between anti-NP IgG levels and the titre of neutralising antibodies (IC50).

AIM: To analyze the Scopus-based depression research and COVID-19, explain the advancement of research nowadays, and comment on the possible hotspots of depression research and COVID-19 to obtain a more global perspective. METHODS: In this report, bibliometric analysis and visualization are used to explain COVID-19's global research status on depression and provide researchers with a guide to identify future research directions. Relevant studies on depression and COVID-19 were retrieved from the Scopus database. Visualization maps were produced using the VOSviewer software, including research collaboration. RESULTS: At the time of data collection (November 18, 2020), 77217 documents were released by Scopus to COVID-19 in all areas of research. By limiting the search to depression and COVID-19 (January 2020 up until November 18, 2020), there are 1274 published articles on depression and COVID-19 in the Scopus. The great majority of which are original articles (n = 1049, 82.34%), followed by 118 review articles (9.26%), 66 letters (5.18%). The United States had the highest number of publications at 282 (22.14%), followed by China (19.07%) at 243 and Italy at 121 (9.5%).

We tested the first hypothesis through an anonymous questionnaire addressed to hospital staff members. We estimated symptomatic secondary attack rates (SAR) for 333 index cases according to spouse ABO blood group compatibility. Incompatibility was associated with a lower SAR (28% vs. 47%; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27C0.69), but no ABO dependence was detected in compatible situations. For the second hypothesis, we detected no binding of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD to blood group-containing glycans.

One variant, JHM-DL, produces large plaques, while the other, JHM-DS, produces small plaques in tissue culture. DS replicates more slowly, has a lower virus yield in vitro, and is less virulent for mice than DL. They also differ in their pathogenicity for mice: JHM-DL infection results in acute encephalomyelitis while JHM-DS infection results in demyelination. Oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of the RNA genomes of these two variants revealed that they had almost identical genetic sequences. Each variant, however, had a unique oligonucleotide spot not found in the other. The unique spot of the large plaque variant, JHM-DL, was localized at approximately 3 to 5 kb from the 3' end, while the JHM-DS unique spot was mapped at 14 to 15 kb from the 3' end of the genome. We have further shown that these oligonucleotide changes are not correlated with the plaque morphology.

The term 'Corona Virus' came into the picture on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China, and then on, it has started spreading rapidly. Bahrain could no more be leading a normal life with its first case witnessed on February 21, 2020, and had to opt for 'work from home.' With the economic recession, the business sector was forced to cut costs, which has made them reduce the number of employees. Nevertheless, there has been psychological support rendered to the employees by the organization, which makes the crux of this study. The research objective was to study the impact of demographics on selected factors: work culture, job security, and psychological support. Further, the study also adds new observation to knowledge by identifying psychological factors considered by respondents as most needed during this covid-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using a self-designed questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale. The data were collected using a convenient sampling method for selected corporate companies in Bahrain. Further, semi-structured interviews were conducted one-to-one to understand the respondents' experiences. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analysis. Variables were tested for the significance of the relationship using the Pearson Chi-Square test. Further, factor analysis was also used to understand which factor is considered the most important in contributing to the psychological support provided by employers to employees. The results encapsulate that the psychological support from employers to employees plays a role in inculcating a sense of belonging to the organization and self-esteem development, contributing to the well-being of the self and the family, a harmonious society.","output":"Effect of psychological support from employers to employees during COVID-19 pandemic in Bahrain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies suggest that even moderate sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) causes reduction of gray matter volume in the primary auditory cortex, diminishing its ability to react to sound stimulation, as well as reorganization of functional brain networks.

We also assessed the potential of graph-theoretical measures as biomarkers of disease, in terms of their relationship to clinically relevant audiological parameters. Eight patients with moderate or severe unilateral SSNHL and 15 healthy controls were included in this prospective pilot study. All patients underwent rs-fMRI to study potential changes in brain connectivity. From rs-fMRI data, global and local graph-theoretical measures, disruption index, and audiological examinations were estimated. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to study the differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls. Associations between brain metrics and clinical variables were studied using multiple linear regressions, and the presence or absence of brain network hubs was assessed using Fisher's exact test. No statistically significant differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls were found in global or local network measures. However, when analyzing brain networks through the disruption index, we found a brain-wide functional network reorganization (p < 0.001 as compared with controls), whose extent was associated with clinical impairment (p < 0.05). We also observed several functional hubs in SSNHL patients that were not present in healthy controls and vice versa.

Evidenced by a solid increase of publications, numbers of specialized journals, professional associations, national and international conferences, academies for medical educators, masters and doctoral courses, and the establishment of many units of HPE scholarship, the domain of HPE education scholarship has matured into a scholarly discipline in its own right. In this contribution, the author reviews the developments of the field from Boyer's four criteria that determine scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. Born mid\\\\20th century, and in the first decades developed in the predominant area of physician education, HPE scholarship has matured, with increasing breadth, depth, and volume of scholars, publications, conferences, and dedicated centers for research and development. The author concludes that, given the infrastructure that has emerged, HPE can arguably be considered a discipline in its own right. This academic question may not matter hugely for practices of scholarly work in this domain, and any stance in this academic debate inevitably reflects a personal view, but the author would support the view of health professions scholarship as being a unique niche, with inherent dependence on both medical and other health professional sciences, on the one hand, and social sciences, including educational sciences, on the other hand.","output":"Health professions education scholarship: The emergence, current status, and future of a discipline in its own right"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To identify the most effective dressing for covering long-term central venous catheter exit site to prevent catheter-related infections and skin irritation in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS Systematic Review. The search was performed in the following electronic databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Google Scholar was used for the gray literature search. RESULTS Seven studies were included which tested different arrangements of dressings: sterilized gauze and adhesive tape with a transparent polyurethane film (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with a different replacement interval frequency (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with and without chlorhexidine released continuously by the dressing at the site of intravascular catheter insertion (n = 2), and dressings vs. no dressings (n = 1). The meta-analysis for catheter-related infection prevention showed no difference between type of dressing (RR 1.76, [95% CI 0.82; 3.75], I2 0%) and for the replacement frequency at different intervals (RR 1.04, [95% CI 0.67; 1.61], I2 0%). The meta-analysis for skin irritation evaluated the transparent polyurethane film replacement frequency and indicated that a longer dressing replacement interval (10 to 15 days) reduces the risk of developing this outcome (RR 0.71, 0.52; 0.96, 95% CI, I2 24%). CONCLUSIONS Regarding the type of the dressing, there is no evidence indicating the best dressing. Although there is no evidence available for the ideal replacement frequency, the risk to develop skin irritation is reduced in longer dressing replacements intervals.","output":"Dressings for the central venous catheter to prevent infection in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic overwhelms the medical resources in the stressed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and the shortage of mechanical ventilation (MV) We performed CT-based analysis combined with electronic health records and clinical laboratory results on Cohort 1 (n = 1662 from 17 hospitals) with prognostic estimation for the rapid stratification of PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients These models, validated on Cohort 2 (n = 700) and Cohort 3 (n = 662) constructed from nine external hospitals, achieved satisfying performance for predicting ICU, MV, and death of COVID-19 patients (AUROC 0 916, 0 919, and 0 853), even on events happened two days later after admission (AUROC 0 919, 0 943, and 0 856) Both clinical and image features showed complementary roles in prediction and provided accurate estimates to the time of progression (p &lt; 0 001) Our findings are valuable for optimizing the use of medical resources in the COVID-19 pandemic The models are available here: https://github com/terryli710/COVID_19_Rapid_Triage_Risk_Predictor","output":"AI-based analysis of CT images for rapid triage of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic is associated with secondary opportunistic fungal infections.

The election of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2018 marked the beginning of a political transition for Ethiopia, which had been governed by a coalition of ethno-regional parties called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) since 1991.1 The Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) had long dominated the EPRDF, despite the fact that Tigrayans make up only seven percent of Ethiopia's population.2 Repression by the EPRDF prompted several years of protests led by Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, and by members of the second largest group, the Amhara,3 and brought Abiy, the EPRDF's first Oromo leader, to power with promises of reform.4 Abiy's government released political prisoners, removed terrorist designations on opposition groups, . . . loosened media and civil society restrictions, and prosecuted former officials for abuses and corruption.5 Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts, especially his negotiation of an end to a long-running border dispute with Eritrea, which borders the Tigray region.6 There were increasing frictions, however, between Abiy and the TPLF. 16 In an ultimately successful effort to stop the Tigrayan force's advance, Abiy called on civilians to take up arms, went to the front lines, and deployed armed drones reportedly acquired from the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Iran.17 Amidst improving security conditions, on February 15, Ethiopia's parliament voted to lift the state of emergency declared in November.18 Since the outbreak of the conflict, the international community, including the United States, has repeatedly called on the parties to cease hostilities.19 The African Union (AU) has played a leading role in mediation efforts in the region, deploying AU High Representative for the Horn of Africa region and former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo.20 Both the United States and the United Nations have expressed support for the AU efforts.21 The need to end the conflict has become more urgent as the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated. 32 The order authorized the secretary of the treasury to impose sanctions on, among others, the governments involved in the conflict, military or security forces operating in northern Ethiopia, and persons engaged in or complicit in human rights abuses, threats to security, obstructing humanitarian assistance, or a variety of other harmful actions in northern Ethiopia.33 The White House framed the sanctions as targeting those responsible for, or complicit in, prolonging the conflict, obstructing humanitarian access, or preventing a ceasefire, while promising that the United States would seek to ensure personal remittances to non-sanctioned persons, humanitarian assistance to at-risk populations, and longer-term assistance programs and commercial activities that address basic human needs continue to flow to Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region through legitimate and transparent channels.","output":"United States Supports International Efforts to End Conflict in Northern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing is an effective means for containing the spread of COVID-19, but only so if we all participate.

Lumbar puncture, the gold standard diagnostic procedure for intracranial hypertension, is contraindicated in some conditions while brain imaging procedures may be too difficult to be performed on critically ill patients. To solve this problem, this study aims to assess an alternative method to detect intracranial hypertension by measuring optic nerve sheath diameter using ocular ultrasound and optic nerve sheath diameter difference in each etiology. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Emergency Department of Dr Iskak Tulungagung General Hospital. Sixty-nine patients who visited the emergency room for the first onset of intracranial pathology were included for optic nerve sheath diameter measurement by ultrasound. Subjects were divided into elevated and non-elevated intracranial pressure groups based on head computed tomography scan findings. The optic nerve sheath diameter results were compared and analyzed. RESULT: There were 29 subjects in the elevated intracranial pressure group and 40 subjects in the non-elevated intracranial pressure group. The mean of optic nerve sheath diameter in the elevated and non-elevated intracranial pressure groups was 0.63  0.06 and 0.57  0.06 cm, respectively (p = 0.000). Based on receiver operating characteristics analysis, 0.58 cm was the most optimal cut-off value.

This article correlates the changing isolation facility designs with changing disease incidence and prevention strategies. It argues that isolation moved into the hospital in stages that have consequence for isolation facility design today. Between the 1890s and 1940s, contagious disease care shifted from remote isolation hospitals (commonly known as pest houses) to separate contagious disease hospitals, to contagious disease \\"units\\" adjacent to or within a general hospital facility, and to isolation rooms included in nursing units. The architectural history of isolation facility designs shows that the integration of isolation facilities into general hospitals relied on the success of new aseptic nursing procedures that prevented contact transmission but which downgraded the need for spatial separation to prevent airborne transmission. In the second half of the 20th century, federal funding and standards made isolation rooms in the hospital the norm. This migration coincided with a historically unprecedented reduction in contagious disease incidence produced by successful vaccines and antibiotics. By the 1980s, the rise of new and antibiotic resistant diseases led to extensive redesigns of the in-house isolation rooms to make them more effective. This article suggests that it is time to rethink isolation not just at the detail level but in terms of its location in relation to the general hospital.","output":"Consequences of Migrating U.S. Contagious Facilities Into General Hospitals, 1900-1950."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health concerns such as multi- and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis, bioterrorism, pandemic influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome have intensified efforts to prevent transmission of infections that are completely or partially airborne using environmental controls.

Camostat mesylate, an orally available and clinically used serine protease inhibitor, inhibits TMPRSS2, supporting clinical trials to investigate its use in COVID-19. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model for camostat and the active metabolite FOY-251 was developed, incorporating TMPRSS2 reversible covalent inhibition by FOY-251, and empirical equations linking TMPRSS2 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The model predicts that 95% inhibition of TMPRSS2 is required for 50% inhibition of viral entry efficiency. For camostat 200 mg dosed four times daily, 90% inhibition of TMPRSS2 is predicted to occur but with only about 40% viral entry inhibition. For 3-fold higher camostat dosing, marginal improvement of viral entry rate inhibition, up to 54%, is predicted. Because respiratory tract viral load may be associated with negative outcome, even modestly reducing viral entry and respiratory tract viral load may reduce disease progression. This modeling also supports medicinal chemistry approaches to enhancing PK/PD and potency of the camostat molecule. IMPORTANCE Strategies to repurpose already-approved drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been attractive since the beginning of the pandemic. Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis, inhibits TMPRSS1, a host cell surface serine protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. In vitro experiments provided data suggesting that camostat might be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Multiple clinical trials were planned to test the hypothesis that camostat would be beneficial for treating COVID-19 (for example, clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04353284). The present work used a one-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) mathematical model for camostat and the active metabolite FOY-251, incorporating TMPRSS2 reversible covalent inhibition by FOY-251, and empirical equations linking TMPRSS2 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

The multi-reference coupled-cluster approaches are based on the effective Hamiltonian formulation providing a two-step procedure, in which dynamic correlation effects can be efficiently evaluated by the wave operator, while nondynamic correlation contributions are given by diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian in the final step. There are two classical multi-reference coupled-cluster formulations.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at three radiation oncology departments within the \\"XXXX\\" Health system in \\"XXXX\\" during the initial COVID-19 surge. Primary end points were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and to identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes. Results: 545 cancer patients were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced >1 COVID-related care change. Radiation treatment (RT) delays were most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, while patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (p=0.040), intent of treatment (p=0.047), and cancer type (p<0.001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent, and rectal cancer patients were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type. Conclusion: Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect cancer patients during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness; while the lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or may simply be logistical, as palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk.

Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. AIM: to analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4 years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: we used anonymised electronic health records and administrative data from the secure anonymised information linkage databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. METHODS: we calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted HRs for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. RESULTS: survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared with 2016. Compared with the general population in 2016C2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11, 2.20) in 2016C2019 to 2.94 (2.81, 3.08) in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: the survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on adjusted mortality risk in care homes for older adults in Wales, UK: a retrospective population-based cohort study for mortality in 2016C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with a range of devastating acute clinical manifestations affecting the lungs, liver, kidneys and gut The best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV2, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, is highly expressed in these tissues However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood Here we show that the complement system is unexpectedly one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV2 infection in lung epithelial and liver cells Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity Modelling the regulome of host genes induced by COVID-19 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system downstream of type I interferon receptors, and NF-kB Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor and the top predicted pharmaceutical candidate, normalized interferon signature genes, IL-6 (the best characterized severity marker in COVID-19) and all complement genes induced by SARS-CoV2, but did not affect NF-kB-regulated genes We predict that combination therapy with JAK inhibitors and other agents with the potential to normalize NF-kB-signaling, such as anti-viral agents, may serve as an effective clinical strategy","output":"SARS-CoV2 drives JAK1/2-dependent local and systemic complement hyper-activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of May 04, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 3.5 million people and touched every inhabited continent. Accordingly, it has stressed health systems the world over leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding healthcare resource rationing. It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak, and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging emergent and elective spine surgery patients. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling. RESULTS: The devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurological status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a highrisk post-operative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden. The resultant calculator was deployed as a freely-available web-based calculator: https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/SpineUrgencyCalculator/ CONCLUSION: Here we present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings.

Most studies focused on the direct access to emergency medical resources, and few studies took the crowding of hospital emergency department as an evaluation index to reflect the convenience of obtaining emergency medical resources. It is a significance for the identification of areas with insufficient access to emergency service resources with this method. METHODS: This paper utilizes the improved potential model and the inverted Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method, combined with network map API service data to evaluate response time, delivery time and waiting time (for emergency department crowding) spent in different residential areas of Xian City in the process of emergency. Meanwhile, the vulnerable regions of gaining emergency medical resources are identified through the comprehensive analysis of the three stages of emergency. RESULTS: The studies show that the residents in built-up area are more convenient to get ambulance service and arrive at care hospitals than those in suburban areas, but they may face greater hospital crowdedness. Although suburban residents are faced with low hospital crowdedness, they spend more time on getting ambulances and going to care hospitals. The accessibility of emergency medical resources varies greatly among residents in different regions, with 5.38% of the residents were identified in the high-risk area distributing in suburban residential areas in the south of the city center, 21.92% in the medium risk area in the southern mountainous areas and the periphery of the core suburban areas of the city, and 46.11% in the low-risk area which are mainly distributed in built-up areas in gaining emergency medical services. CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, getting an ambulance and arriving at the nearest hospital quickly shows that it is conducive to access to emergency resources. However, the impact of hospital emergency crowding can not be ignored, especially in the area surrounded by high-grade hospitals in the central area of the city. In considering the spatial layout of emergency stations and emergency hospitals, the dislocation distribution of hospitals at different levels should be reasonably adjusted to balance the equity of residents in obtaining emergency medical resources.","output":"Identifying the vulnerable regions of emergency medical services based on the three-stage of accessibility: a case study in Xian, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 30 June 2021, China was certified malaria-free by the World Health Organization. In this study, the evolution, performance, outcomes, and impact of Chinas adaptive strategy and approach for malaria elimination from 2011 to 2020 were analysed using 10-year data. The strategy and approach focused on timely detection and rapid responses to individual cases and foci. Indigenous cases declined from 1,308 in 2011 to 36 in 2015, and the last one was reported from Yunnan Province in April 2016, although thousands of imported cases still occur annually. The 1C3C7 approach was implemented successfully between 2013 and 2020, with 100% of cases reported within 24 h, 94.5% of cases investigated within three days of case reporting, and 93.4% of foci responses performed within seven days. Additionally, 81.6% of patients attended the first healthcare visit within 1C3 days of onset and 58.4% were diagnosed as malaria within three days of onset, in 2017C2020.

Given the nonlinear pattern of dynamic interaction between sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and para sympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the complex relationship with lifestyle factors, machine learning (ML) algorithms are best suited for analyzing alcohol impact over heart rate variability (HRV), because they allow the analysis of complex interactions between multiple variables. This study aimed to characterize autonomic nervous system dysfunction by analysis of HRV correlated with cardiovascular risk factors in young individuals by using machine learning. Materials and Methods: Total of 142 young adults (28.4  4.34 years) agreed to participate in the study. Alcohol intake and drinking patterns were assessed by the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) questionnaire and the YAI (Yearly Alcohol Intake) index. A short 5-min HRV evaluation was performed. Post-hoc analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the impact of alcohol intake on HRV. Results: Binge drinkers presented slight modification in the frequency domain. Heavy drinkers had significantly lower time-domain values: standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD), compared to casual and binge drinkers. High frequency (HF) values were significantly lower in heavy drinkers (p = 0.002). The higher low-to-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) that we found in heavy drinkers was interpreted as parasympathetic inhibition. Gradient boosting machine learner regression showed that age and alcohol consumption had the biggest scaled impact on the analyzed HRV parameters, followed by smoking, anxiety, depression, and body mass index. Gender and physical activity had the lowest impact on HRV. Conclusions: In healthy young adults, high alcohol intake has a negative impact on HRV in both time and frequency-domains. In parameters like HRV, where a multitude of risk factors can influence measurements, artificial intelligence algorithms seem to be a viable alternative for correct assessment.","output":"Assessment of the Impact of Alcohol Consumption Patterns on Heart Rate Variability by Machine Learning in Healthy Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teaching, learning, and assessment methods have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the specific mechanism for that improvement remains unclear. We examined whether the curcumin derivative galangin could reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue in mice with NAFLD by inducing autophagy, from the perspective of both prevention and treatment. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a prevention group (given galangin and a HFD simultaneously) or a treatment group (given galangin after being fed an HFD). The prevention group was treated with galangin (100 mg/kg/d) or an equal volume of normal saline (NS) while being fed an HFD. Some mice were treated with an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA; 30 mg/kg/biwk, i.p.) while being fed an HFD and galangin. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing both free fatty acids and galangin. Results: Galangin was found to reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue induced by eating an HFD at both the prevention and treatment levels, and that effect might be related to an enhancement of hepatocyte autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA blocked the protective effect of galangin on hepatic steatosis. At the cellular level, galangin reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced the level of hepatocyte autophagy. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo studies showed that galangin cannot only improve pre-existing hepatic steatosis but also prevent the development of stenosis by promoting hepatocyte autophagy.","output":"Galangin Improved Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice by Promoting Autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The institutional affiliation of Dr. Aly Elsayed Mohamed Elsayed should be as follow.","output":"Correction to: Efficacy of pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite possibly higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), there has been limited reporting of COVID-19 trends for this population.

These strategies have, however, been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online changepoint detection (CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised changepoints, in a data driven manner. Back-testing our model over the period 1995-2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of one-third. The module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the performance boost is approximately two-thirds.

METHODS: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high-speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2, 2.75 mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. RESULTS: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2-mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol was unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume toward the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67  8 s in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2-mm tip toward the corneal wound.

Hypodermic necrosis was debrided using L. sericata maggots, and subsequently specialist dressings were applied to promote granulation and healing. In the case discussed here, effectiveness of MDT was rather poor, however the treatment minimised the risk of infection associated with evacuation of necrosis.

Lineage A betacoronaviruses incorporate a 95-bp stem-loop structure, the packaging signal (PS), into the nsp15 locus of ORF1b that is both necessary and sufficient for the packaging of RNAs. However, unlike other viral PSs, where mutations generally resulted in viral replication defects, mutation of the coronavirus (CoV) PS results in large increases in subgenomic RNA packaging with minimal effects on gRNA packaging in vitro and on viral titers. Here, we show that selective packaging is also required for viral evasion of the innate immune response and optimal pathogenicity. We engineered two distinct PS mutants in two different strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) that packaged increased levels of subgenomic RNAs, negative-sense genomic RNA, and even cellular RNAs. All PS mutant viruses replicated normally in vitro but caused dramatically reduced lethality and weight loss in vivo. PS mutant virus infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in increased interferon (IFN) production, indicating that the innate immune system limited the replication and/or pathogenesis of PS mutant viruses in vivo. PS mutant viruses remained attenuated in MAVS(?/?) and Toll-like receptor 7-knockout (TLR7(?/?)) mice, two well-known RNA sensors for CoVs, but virulence was restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR(?/?)) mice or in MAVS(?/?) mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibodies. Together, these data indicate that coronaviruses promote virulence by utilizing selective packaging to avoid innate immune detection.","output":"Selective Packaging in Murine Coronavirus Promotes Virulence by Limiting Type I Interferon Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is witnessing tumultuous times as major economic powers including the US, UK, Russia, India, and most of Europe continue to be in a state of lockdown.

The N501Y mutation is found in South African and Brazilian variants and is also shared with the UK variant VOC-202012/01 (1).

Many different products have been used to meet the demands of large-scale diagnostic and surveillance testing. The stability of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was assessed in several commercially produced transport media and an in-house solution. Coronavirus RNA was rapidly destroyed in the commercial transport media though the deleterious effects on intact virus were limited. Similar results were obtained for a Type A influenza virus. There was reduced detection of both virus and nucleic acid when a herpesvirus sample and purified DNA were tested. Collectively these data showed that the commercial viral transport media contained nucleases or similar substances and may seriously compromise diagnostic and epidemiological investigations. Recommendations to include foetal bovine serum as a source of protein to enhance the stabilising properties of viral transport media are contraindicated. Almost all commercial batches of foetal bovine serum contain pestiviruses and at times other bovine viruses. In addition to the potential for there to be nucleases in the transport medium, the presence of these viruses and other extraneous nucleic acid in samples may compromise the interpretation of sequence data. The inclusion of foetal bovine serum presents a biosecurity risk for the movement of animal pathogens and renders these transport media unsuitable for animal disease diagnostic applications. While these transport media may be suitable for virus culture purposes, there could be misleading results if used for nucleic acid-based tests.

Typical treatment for type I GNETs comprises simple surveillance and/or endoscopic resection. For alleviation of hypergastrinemia resulting in ECL cell hypertrophy, antrectomy is a treatment option. Type I GNETs mostly have excellent prognosis, and if a surgical approach is chosen, the procedure must be minimally invasive. One such technique for multiple type I GNETs, minimally invasive single-incision laparoscopic antrectomy (SILA), is reported here for the first time. CASE PRESENTATION We performed SILA on a 46-year-old woman who developed type I GNETs caused by hypergastrinemia due to autoimmune gastritis. A Lap-Protector was inserted in a 3 cm incision at the umbilicus, and set an EZ Access equipped with two 5 mm trocars and one 12 mm trocar. Antrectomy without lymph node dissection was performed using a 5 mm forward-oblique viewing endoscope, a vessel sealing device, and linear staplers, while reconstruction was by Billroth I reconstruction. Side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a 45 mm linear stapler. The stapler entry hole was sutured intracorporeally using barbed suture material. The operation time was 140 min and blood loss was 5 ml. The patient was discharged ten days after surgery without complications. Serum gastrin level decreased to within the normal range on the day after the operation. One year after surgery, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed pathological disappearance of all lesions of the remnant stomach. CONCLUSIONS SILA is a minimally-invasive and tolerable technique for treatment of multiple type I GNETs. In this reported case there was good cohesiveness and effectiveness in normalizing gastrin levels and in elimination of remnant gastric lesions.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic antrectomy for type I gastric neuroendocrine tumor: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions among ambulatory patients tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a large public US healthcare system and found a low overall rate of antibiotic prescriptions (6.7%).

Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment have been shown to improve the prognosis of VAP. Chest X-ray or computed tomography imaging are used for conventional assessment of VAP, but these methods are impractical for real-time measurement in critical patients. Therefore, lung ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used for the assessment of VAP in the ICU. Traditionally, LUS has seemed unsuitable for the detection of lung parenchyma owing to the high acoustic impedance of air; however, the fact that the reflection and reverberation in the detection region of the ultrasound reflect the underlying pathology of lung diseases has led to the increased use of ultrasound imaging as a standard of care supported by evidence-based and expert consensus in the ICU. Considering that any type of pneumonia causes air volume changes in the lungs, accumulating evidence has shown that LUS effectively measures the presence of VAP as well as dynamic changes in VAP. This review offers evidence for ultrasound as a noninvasive, easily repeatable, and bedside means to assess VAP; in addition, it establishes a protocol for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of VAP.

Retrospective analysis of test trending data was performed from initiation of testing on the 11th March through to the 14th April 2021. FINDINGS: During this time interval, 203,065 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed, with 3,855 samples testing positive, giving a prevalence of 1.9%. In total 1,913 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from positive cases with Ct values < 30 and 1,635 (85.5%) sequences passed quality metrics for lineage analysis. A high diversity of 49 different SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified, including the VOCs B.1.1.7 (Kent; 80.6%), B.1.351 (South Africa; 4.2%), B.1.617.2 (India; 1.7%), P.1 (Brazil; 0.4%) and B.1.1.7 with E484K (Bristol; 0.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was age-related and dose-dependent, ranging from 5% in > 60 with a single dose to 83% in <60 with both doses of a vaccine. Viral load was variant dependent with the B.1.617.2 showing a 21 fold increase in viral copy number compared to the other variants.

Using dual Blimp1/Foxp3 reporter mice and single cell-indexed analysis, we segregate persistent compartments and expressed transcriptional programs of Blimp1+ CXCR5+PD1hi TFH (referred to here as PC-TFH) from canonical Blimp1- Bcl6+ TFH (GC-TFH) and Blimp1+Foxp3+ TFR immune regulators. Antigen recall expands localized PC-TFH compartments with rapidly divergent antigen-specific memory PC-TFH and GC-TFH programs. Thus, Blimp1 is a central mediator of PC-TFH function producing specialized TFH subsets that co-ordinate with GC-TFH function to establish high-affinity long-lasting protective immunity to vaccines and infection. One-Sentence Summary Blimp1 expressing TFH cells express unique transcriptional programs to control PC formation RESEARCH ARTICLE SUMMARY Introduction Adaptive B cell immunity rapidly emerges to form plasma cells (PC) for antibody production and non-PC that enter germinal centers (GC) to evolve higher affinity B cell receptors. Both pathways are essential to long-term high-affinity immune protection. The early PC to GC cell fate division is driven by B cell expression of mutually antagonist transcriptional repressors Blimp1 and Bcl6. This dichotomous B cell outcome is orchestrated through antigen-specific contact by follicular helper T (TFH) cells that express Bcl6 to upregulate CXCR5, localize into B cell regions and express transcriptional programs that influence B cell fate and function. It remains unclear what TFH cell mechanisms differentially impact these divergent B cell pathways. Rationale Blimp1 is found in Foxp3+ follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells known to impact GC B cell outcomes and play a role controlling antibody-mediated autoimmunity. In the context of infection, induced Blimp1 expression in CD4 T cells is expressed by conventional non-TFH effector cell compartments. Blimp1 segregates with emigrant CD4 T cells that leave the reactive lymphoid tissue to control innate immune function at the site of antigen entry. Conversely, Bcl6 is predominantly expressed in the GC regulating TFH pathway and is demonstrated to suppress Blimp1 expression. Germline ablation of Bcl6 exaggerates type 2 effector TH cell functions that promote excessive antibody production in the absence of the GC reaction. Similarly, loss of Bcl6 in CD4 T cells abrogates GC formation and post-GC PC responses, however multiple recent reports indicate continued support for antibody production without a Bcl6+ TFH compartment. To reconcile these findings, we propose a division of TFH function with separable pathways to regulate PC and GC differentiation. We hypothesize a central role for persistent CD4 T cell expressed Blimp1 that segregates early TFH transcriptional control to create an effector cell program that selectively targets PC differentiation. Results Direct intracellular staining for protein, confirmed with single Blimp1 and dual (Foxp3) reporter mice, identified Blimp1 expressing CXCR5+PD1hi TFH and TFR subsets within the spleen, bone marrow and other lymphoid tissues at steady-state. Conditional deletion of Prdm1 in CD4 T cells and adoptive transfer into immunodeficient hosts with splenic B cells, truncated both early pre-GC and late post-GC formation of PC providing a causal link to both pathways of differentiation in vivo. Across steady-state splenic T cells, in vitro activated Blimp1+CD25- CD4 T cells in T-B cell co-cultures correlated with significant levels of PC induction. Integrated single cell-indexed strategies segregate the transcriptional programs of Blimp1 expressing TFH cells (referred to here as PC-TFH) from canonical GC-inducing Bcl6+ TFH cells (GC-TFH), both distinct from Blimp1+ TFR cell programs in the steady-state. Immunization and recall produce follicular localized PC-TFH with pMHCII-tetramer binding memory response TFH cells that segregate across PC-TFH and GC-TFH compartments re-iterating the dichotomous transcriptome seen at steady-state. Conclusion This study identifies Blimp1 as a key mediator of PC-TFH cells that sub-specialize as inducers of PC differentiation and bifurcate from the Bcl6+ GC-TFH cell pathway and functions. Persistent PC-TFH compartments assort across multiple lymphoid tissues at steady-state and are distinct from Foxp3+Blimp1+ TFR immune regulators. While PC TFH cells alone are required for early and rapid antibody responses, both TFH sub-classes are essential to the generation of high-affinity long-lived and memory response PC compartments. Cellular organization and molecular components of the PC-TFH transcriptional program indicate functional sub-specialization that can be separately targeted for immunotherapeutic purposes and adjuvant design in future vaccines. Sub-specialized Blimp1+ PC-TFH cells control PC differentiation Adaptive immune protection requires balancing the evolution of BCR affinity within germinal center (GC) B cells and the differentiation of plasma cells (PC) for production of antibodies. Both functional B cell pathways require the antigen-specific induction of specialized CD4+ follicular T (TFH) cells. Within GC-inducing TFH cells, Bcl6 is required to drive the formation and function of GC B cells. Here, we segregate PC-inducing TFH cells that require Blimp1 as a key mediator of antigen-specific PC differentiation. The Blimp1+ PC-TFH transcriptional program diverges from Bcl6+ GC-TFH compartment and Blimp1+Foxp3+ follicular regulatory T (TFR) compartments. Antigen-specific PC-TFH emerge and segregate rapidly from GC-TFH after priming and recall to co-operatively induce effective long-term adaptive immunity.","output":"Follicular helper T cells expressing Blimp1 are specialized for plasma cell differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of Internet technology development has allowed consumers to purchase online products or services, especially during the Movement Control Order (MCO) lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia Online shopping has become a new norm;however, the services needed frequent updates for improvements Literature has shown that online shopping website quality influenced online shoppers decision-making Hencein improving the quality of online shopping websites, the criteria for the websites quality is vital Therefore, this study aims to identify the criteria of Malaysia online shopping website quality and rank the website quality by using Fuzzy TOPSIS method Questionnaire is developed for website usersto evaluate the online shopping website quality via google form and disseminated through social media After data cleaning, 300 respondents data were used for analysis The result shows that the online shopping website quality for Shopee is ranked the first, next is Lazada, then Lelong and finally the 11-street ? 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering All rights reserved","output":"Fuzzy TOPSIS method as a decision supporting system to rank Malaysia online shopping website quality during COVID-19 MCO 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study provides comparable lower-bound estimates of inequality of opportunity for tertiary education (EIOp) for 31 countries in Europe, by using the two EU-SILC waves for which information on family background is available (2005 and 2011).

Parental education and occupation are the most relevant circumstances in the great majority of the countries considered. This study also exploits the two point-in-time observations available and analyses the relationship between some country-specific characteristics and inequality of opportunity in tertiary education. The analysis documents a negative association between EIOp and real GDP per capita, possibly indicating that higher equality of opportunity in tertiary education and economic growth are complementary objectives. Two results emerge as especially robust: in all the specifications we find a positive association between EIOp and the students/teacher ratio, and a negative one between EIOp and public spending in tertiary education.

Methods: : An online survey was conducted in March 2020 on social media platforms in Jordan. The questionnaire consisted of questions related to demographic characteristics, past medical and ocular history, frequency of using digital devices before and during lockdown, and the emergence and severity of DES symptoms. Results: : Data from 1,460 responders were analyzed. About half of the respondents were between 30- 49 years, 28.4 % were retired, 21% had chronic systemic illness, and 23% reported chronic eye problems. A rise in the use of digital devices during lockdown was reported by 957 participants, with 33% of them used digital devices more than 4 hours a day. The most common symptoms before and during lockdown were neck and shoulder pain, which revealed the most significant association (X 2 201.61, p 0.000). Female gender, existence of chronic eye problems and systemic diseases, and duration of using digital devices were found to be statistically significant factors associated with increasing severity of eye symptoms during lockdown. Regarding developing new eye complaints during the lockdown, only taking regular breaks was not significant ( p 0.336) . People with chronic eye problems and increased time using devices during lockdown developed new eye complaints three times more than before the lockdown and males were two times more likely than females to have more severe eye symptoms.

The UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) recently reported on a national cohort of pregnant women who required hospital admission due to COVID-19 between March and April 2020.1 We aimed to assess the demographics and outcomes for obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection within our Scottish, inner-city health board and compare this against that reported by UKOSS. Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained and the requirement for ethical approval waved by the local research ethics service. All female patients of child-bearing age (age 16C49) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 16 March C 3 June 2020 were identified by the local Infection Prevention and Control team. These data were cross-referenced with local electronic notes systems to identify pregnant or recently pregnant women (within 6 weeks post-partum). Collected data were de-identified prior to analysis and analyses performed using R statistical software. Descriptive statistics are reported with results expressed as mean (SD), median [IQR], or n (%). Results: In total, 741 eligible women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the study period. Twenty-three (3%) were pregnant or recently pregnant, with 14 of these women (60%) requiring hospital admission (representing 5.1 cases per 1000 maternities). All identified patients of Black or Asian ethnicity were admitted to hospital (5 in total), whilst only 47% of women of white ethnicity were admitted. The most common symptoms in admitted patients were cough (present in 64% of cases) and fever (present in 57% of cases). Amongst admitted patients, median age was 31.5 [29.3C34.0], median gestation at diagnosis 30.5 [24.3C37.5] weeks and 6 patients (43%) had a booking BMI [Formula presented]0 kg/m2. Three hospitalised patients (21.4%) required oxygen therapy and one required post-operative ICU monitoring. Two fetal losses occurred before 22 weeks gestation. No neonatal deaths occurred and no infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: During this first wave of the pandemic, rates of COVID-19 were in keeping with those reported by UKOSS. This may reflect local adherence to shielding advice, or that testing was performed only on symptomatic patients. Also in keeping with results from UKOSS, patients from minority ethnic groups (and those with high BMIs) were over represented in hospital admission rates. All patients studied have subsequently been discharged home and mainly required level 1 care during admission.

CVC also strongly antagonizes C-C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b), thereby it has potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. CVC is currently under clinical trials in the patients for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis. In this study, CVC was examined for its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in cell cultures and found to be a selective inhibitor of the virus. The 50% effective concentrations of CVC were 19.0 and 2.9 M in the assays based on the inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and viral RNA levels in culture supernatants of the infected cells, respectively. Interestingly, the CCR5-specific antagonist maraviroc did not show any anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Although the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by CVC remains to be elucidated, CCR2b does not seem to be its target molecule. Considering the fact that the regulation of excessive immune activation is required to treat COVID-19 patients at the late stage of the disease, CVC should be further pursued for its potential in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"The chemokine receptor antagonist cenicriviroc inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging zoonotic viral infection, which was started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and transmitted to other countries worldwide as a pandemic outbreak.

Dried blood spots (DBS), are useful for collecting blood from infants for diagnostic purposes, especially in low-income settings, as the amount of blood required is miniscule and no refrigeration is required. Little is known about their utility for antibody studies in children. This systematic review aims to investigate the correlation of antibody concentrations against infectious diseases in DBS in comparison to serum or plasma samples that might inform their use in vaccine clinical trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library for relevant studies between January 1990 to October 2020 with no language restriction, using PRISMA guidelines, investigating the correlation between antibody concentrations in DBS and serum or plasma samples, and the effect of storage temperature on DBS diagnostic performance. We included 40 studies in this systematic review. The antibody concentration in DBS and serum/plasma samples reported a good pooled correlation, (r(2) = 0.86 (ranged 0.43 to 1.00)). Ten studies described a decline of antibody after 28 days at room temperature compared to optimal storage at -20C, where antibodies were stable for up to 200 days. There were only five studies of anti-bacterial antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a good correlation between antibody concentrations in DBS and serum/plasma samples, supporting the wider use of DBS in vaccine and sero-epidemiological studies, but there is limited data on anti-bacterial antibodies.

The aim of this study is to determine the burnout levels and factors associated with the risk of psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCW) engaged in the management of COVID 19 in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2020 to 30 November 2020 by telephonic interviews using a web-based Google form. Health facilities and community centres from 12 cities located in 10 states were selected for data collection. Data on socio-demographic and occupation-related variables like age, sex, type of family, income, type of occupation, hours of work and income were obtained was obtained from 967 participants, including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, emergency response teams, lab personnel, and others directly involved in COVID 19 patient care. Levels of psychological distress was assessed by the General health Questionnaire -GHQ-5 and levels of burnout was assessed using the ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the risk of psychological distress. The third quartile values of the three subscales of burnout viz EE, DP and PA were used to identify burnout profiles of the healthcare workers. RESULTS: Overall, 52.9% of the participants had the risk of psychological distress that needed further evaluation. Risk of psychological distress was significantly associated with longer hours of work ( 8 hours a day) (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI(1.66C3.41), income20000(AOR = 1.74, 95% CI, (1.16C2.6); screening of COVID-19 patients (AOR = 1.63 95% CI (1.09C2.46), contact tracing (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI (1.1C3.81), High Emotional exhaustion score (EE 16) (AOR = 4.41 95% CI (3.14C6.28) and High Depersonalisation score (DP7) (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.28C2.51)).

Our aim was to study cortical venous filling (CVF) in a time-resolved manner with dynamic computed tomographic angiography and to assess the relationship with clinical outcome. METHODS Patients with a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion underwent noncontrast CT and whole-brain CT perfusion/dynamic CT angiography within 9 hours after stroke-onset. We defined poor outcome as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3. Association between the extent and velocity of CVF and poor outcome at 3 months was analyzed with Poisson-regression. Prognostic value of optimal CVF (maximum opacification of cortical veins) in addition to age, stroke severity, treatment, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, cerebral blood flow, and collateral status was assessed with logistic regression and summarized with the area under the curve. RESULTS Eighty-eight patients were included, with a mean age of 67 years. By combining the extent and velocity of optimal CVF, we observed a decreased risk of poor outcome in patients with good and fast optimal CVF, risk ratio of 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7). Extent and velocity of optimal CVF had additional prognostic value (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.98; P<0.02) compared with a model without CVF information. CONCLUSIONS The combination of extent and velocity of optimal CVF, as assessed with dynamic CT angiography, is useful to identify patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke at higher risk of poor clinical outcome at 3-month follow-up.

Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission being responsible for the current pandemic, appears through airborne aerosols and droplets, thus, there has been an intense focus on such aerosol-generating procedures, and their reduction. Hence the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate available data on three major measures: rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinse, and high-volume evacuators (HVE) aimed at reducing bio-aerosols. METHOD PubMed via Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched between 01 January 1985 and 30 April 2020. RESULTS A total of 156 records in English literature were identified, and 17 clinical studies with 724 patients included in the final analysis. Eligible articles revealed the inadequacy of three principle approaches used in contemporary dental practice to minimize such bio-aerosols, rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinses, and HVE. The latter is an extremely effective method to reduce bio-aerosols in dentistry, although no single method can provide blanket cover.

By interpreting drug effects as local perturbations of the interactome, for a drug to be on-target effective against a specific disease or to cause off-target adverse effects, its targets should be in the nearby of disease-associated genes. Here, we used the network-based proximity measure to compute the distance between the drug module and the disease module in the human interactome by exploiting five different metrics (minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode), with the aim to compare different frameworks for highlighting putative repurposable drugs to treat complex human diseases, including malignant breast and prostate neoplasms, schizophrenia, and liver cirrhosis.

A particular type of bNAb targets the CD4-binding site (CD4-BS) region of Env. These antibodies are derived from a limited number of VH/VL genes and can bind to and neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains. Recent reports have demonstrated the limited potential of Env to activate B cells expressing the germline B cell receptor (BCR) forms of anti-CD4-BS bNAbs. A potential reason for the lack of elicitation of anti-CD4-BS bNAbs by Env immunogens is the absence of stimulation of naive B cells expressing the germline BCRs of such antibodies. Several bNAbs have been isolated from HIV-1-infected subjects that target other structurally conserved regions of Env. How frequently Env immunogens stimulate the germline BCRs that give rise to bNAbs that target Env regions other than the CD4-BS is not well understood. Here, we investigated the interactions between diverse Envs and the BCRs of known bNAbs targeting not only the CD4-BS but also conserved elements of the second and third variable Env regions. Our results indicate that Env is generally ineffective in engaging germline BCRs of bNAbs irrespective of their epitope target. Potentially, this is the result of viral evolutionary mechanisms adopted to escape broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Our results also suggest that a single Env capable of activating germline BCRs that target distinct Env epitopes will be very difficult to identify or to design. IMPORTANCE Broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 are thought to be an important component of the immune responses that a successful vaccine should elicit. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are generated by a subset of those infected by HIV-1, but so far, they have not been generated by immunization with recombinant Envelope (Env, the target of anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies). Here, we provide evidence that the inability of Env to elicit the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies is due to the inability of diverse Envs to engage the germline B cell receptor forms of known broadly neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Diverse recombinant HIV-1 Envs fail to activate B cells expressing the germline B cell receptors of the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies PG9 and 447-52D."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obtaining up to date information on the number of UK COVID-19 regional infections is hampered by the reporting lag in positive test results for people with COVID-19 symptoms.

However, it is unclear what interaction types are associated with outcome-improvement in remote-CBT (rCBT) for SHA. This study aimed to identify interaction types that predict outcomes and sudden gains in rCBT for SHA using initial therapy session content. Forty-eight participants in rCBT for SHA had interactions at their first sessions categorized and rated in terms of patient activation: an individual's confidence and ability to manage their health. Multilevel modelling assessed whether early interaction types predicted session-by-session wellbeing. For participants experiencing sudden gains (n = 12) interactions at the session directly prior to the gain were similarly categorized and rated. The scores were then compared with ratings for the preceding session. A smaller proportion of early sessions was taken up with problem descriptions among those with greater outcome improvements. There was also a significant reduction in the proportion of the session spent describing problems in the session directly prior to a sudden gain, as compared with the previous session. Conversely, clients with better outcomes made more positive evaluations of themselves and therapy, noticed more positive changes and made more contributions to structuring interactions at initial sessions.

Recombinant human antibodies are proven potent neutralizers of viruses and can block the interaction of viral surface proteins with their host receptors. To develop neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, antibody gene libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients were constructed and recombinant antibody fragments (scFv) against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein were selected by phage display. The selected antibodies were produced in the scFv-Fc format and 30 showed more than 80% inhibition of spike (S1-S2) binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry screening assay. The majority of these inhibiting antibodies are derived from the VH3-66 V-gene. The antibody STE90-C11 showed a sub nM IC50 in a plaque-based live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The in vivo efficacy of the antibody was demonstrated in the Syrian hamster and in the hACE2 mice model using a silenced human IgG1 Fc part. The crystal structure of STE90-C11 Fab in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD was solved at 2.0 ? resolution showing that the antibody binds at the same region as ACE2 to RBD. The binding and inhibtion of STE90-C11 is not blocked by many known RBD mutations including N439K, L452R, E484K or L452R+E484Q (emerging B.1.617). STE90-C11 derived human IgG1 with FcR silenced Fc (COR-101) is currently undergoing Phase Ib/II clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. In Brief Human antibodies were selected from convalescent COVID-19 patients using antibody phage display. The antibody STE90-C11 is neutralizing authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro and in vivo and the crystal structure of STE90-C11 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD revealed that this antibody is binding in the RBD-ACE2 interface.

PURPOSE To investigate sensor-derived physical activity and perceived health of people with PD during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS Physical activity was measured over 7 days using the Actigraph GT3x accelerometer. Data were collected regarding perceived health status and physical activity habits, as well as rehabilitation attendance during the pandemic. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with physical activity and perceived changes in health. RESULTS Of 89 participants, a majority (67%) reported a pandemic-related reduction in exercise habits. Women more commonly reported a reduction in scheduled exercise and cancelled rehabilitation than men. Study participants took on average 5876  3180 steps per day. In the multivariate analysis, female gender, being 70 years of age and older, and greater reported mobility problems were associated with being less physically active. A pandemic-induced deterioration in health was reported by 42% and women were 5 times more likely than men to do so (odds ratio: 5.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.87-15.03; P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite a pandemic-related reduction in reported exercise habits and rehabilitation, the participants in this Swedish sample were relatively physically active. However, women were less active at moderate-vigorous levels and were at greater risk of deterioration in perceived health during this time.See the video Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A359.","output":"Physical Activity and Perceived Health in People With Parkinson Disease During the First Wave of Covid-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study From Sweden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to a dramatic increase in life expectancy, the number of individuals aged 65 and older is rapidly rising. This presents considerable challenges to our health care system since advanced age is associated with a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases due to immune senescence. However, the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely understood. Advancement in our comprehension of mechanisms of immune senescence and development of interventions to improve health span requires animal models that closely recapitulate the physiological changes that occur with aging in humans. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are invaluable preclinical models to study the underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis due to their outbred nature, high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, and their susceptibility to human pathogens. In this chapter, we review NHP models available for biogerontology research, advantages and challenges they present, and advances they facilitated. Furthermore, we emphasize the utility of NHPs in characterizing immune senescence, evaluating interventions to reverse aging of the immune system, and development of vaccine strategies that are better suited for this vulnerable population.","output":"Nonhuman Primate Models of Immunosenescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnosticCtherapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohns disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19Crelated deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes.

Baseline risk factors, vaccination status (from 8/12/2020-5/2/2021), and symptoms are recorded at 2 weekly intervals and all SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody test results documented. A mixed effect proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to calculate hazard ratios to compare time to infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants to estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infection.Findings: Vaccine coverage was 89% on 5/2/2021. Significantly lower coverage was associated with prior infection (aOR 0.59 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.64), female (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.82), aged under 35 years, being from minority ethnic groups (especially Black, aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32), porters/security guards (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.90),or midwife (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97), and living in more deprived neighbourhoods (IMD 1 (most) vs. 5 (least) (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87).

Previously, pristine natural areas with high biodiversity were seen as likely sources of new zoonotic pathogens, suggesting that biodiversity could have negative impacts on human health. At the same time, biodiversity has been recognized as potentially benefiting human health by reducing the transmission of some pathogens that have already established themselves in human populations. These apparently opposing effects of biodiversity in human health may now be reconcilable. Recent research demonstrates that some taxa are much more likely to be zoonotic hosts than others are, and that these animals often proliferate in human-dominated landscapes, increasing the likelihood of spillover. In less-disturbed areas, however, these zoonotic reservoir hosts are less abundant and nonreservoirs predominate. Thus, biodiversity loss appears to increase the risk of human exposure to both new and established zoonotic pathogens. This new synthesis of the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic diseases presents an opportunity to articulate the next generation of research questions that can inform management and policy. Future studies should focus on collecting and analyzing data on the diversity, abundance, and capacity to transmit of the taxa that actually share zoonotic pathogens with us. To predict and prevent future epidemics, researchers should also focus on how these metrics change in response to human impacts on the environment, and how human behaviors can mitigate these effects.

PARTICIPANTS: All children aged <19 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection including COVID-19, Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) and Kawasaki-like disease TS infection (KD-TS) treated at a PAEDS site from 24 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. INTERVENTION: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME: Incidence of severe disease among children with COVID-19, PIMS-TS and KD-TS. We also compared KD epidemiology before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 386 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 381 (98.7%) had COVID-19 (median 6.3 years (IQR 2.1C12.8),53.3% male) and 5 (1.3%) had multisystem inflammatory syndromes (PIMS-TS, n=4; KD-TS, n=1) (median 7.9 years (IQR 7.8C9.8)). Most children with COVID-19 (n=278; 73%) were Australian-born from jurisdictions with highest community transmission.

The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test.

Damage to SCN structure alters circadian behavioral and hormonal rhythms and interferes with a regular sleep-wake pattern. Several studies have shown that, in aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian rhythms change their synchronization with the environment and behavior loses sync with light. OBJECTIVE: The current overview aims to examine research studies showing the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) on sleep disorders and sleep-wake patterns in AD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted, taking into consideration the relevant studies over the last 20 years. Fifteen studies have been thorough: seven followed an environmental-architectural approach and eight followed a treatment devices approach. RESULTS: Studies agree in considering BLT as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to compensate for circadian rhythm alterations and they support the need for standardized protocols that allow a comparison between multicenter studies. CONCLUSION: Interestingly, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities have forced the population to stay home. Therefore, AD people are not currently able to enjoy exposure to sunlight. It is predictable that they may experience an exacerbation of circadian disturbances and that the BLT can be an effective response to prevent such exacerbation.","output":"Fiat Lux: The Light Became Therapy.

IARC, 2017). It is estimated that 40% of patients are refractory to, or relapse after treatment with chemo-immunotherapy (R-CHOP). Salvage therapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) can cure around 40% of those patients, nevertheless, the prognosis is poor for most patients with R/R DLBCL who are relapsed after, or ineligible for ASCT, and in those with suboptimal response to salvage chemotherapy. Polatuzumab vedotin is a CD79b-targeted antibody-drug conjugate delivering monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule inhibitor. It was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA on June 2019 for treatment of R/R DLBCL after at least two prior therapies, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. We herein report our experience on the use of polatuzumab in patients with R/R DLBCL. Methods: Retrospective-single center review on the use of polatuzumab vedotin as part of a compassionate program in patients with R/R DLBCL between June 2018 and July 2021. Inclusion criteria for the study were: age  18 years, R/R DLBCL [both de-novo and transformed lymphoma], 2 or more prior lines of therapy, and treatment with polatuzumab-based therapy for at least 1 cycle. Patients with CNS involvement were excluded. The compassionate use access program provided polatuzumab at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, administered with or without bendamustine (up to two doses of 90 mg/m2,) and rituximab (375 mg/m2). Treatment was given every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. Results: we identified 3 patients with R/R DLBCL who were treated with polatuzumab-based therapy. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (2 - 5). The median IPI and CNS-IPI score were 2, (1 - 4) and 2, (2 - 5), respectively (Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table). The median number of Pola-BR cycles received was 3 (2 - 6). One patient completed 6 cycles of polatuzumab with bendamustine and rituximab and achieved partial response. The other two patients were taken of treatment at the time of progression on cycles number 1 and 3. Treatment options were limited after polatuzumab-based therapy. The patient who achieved partial response after 6 cycles of Pola-BR maintained that response for 11 months without additional treatment and died due to COVID-19 associated pneumonia. One patient been screened for Glofitamab compassionate use program, and one patient elected to receive no further therapy.

APPROACH: JeffHOPEs response to challenges posed by COVID-19 focused on a redesign for a pilot clinic at a shelter site that expressed interest in resuming operations. The student leaders conducted a needs assessment with shelter stakeholders, including administrators and long-term residents, to identify service priorities. They also developed a list of key components for safe patient engagement and care delivery. A hybrid telehealth approach was developed to reduce in-person exposure for patients and volunteers and to involve preclinical medical students remotely. Three iPads were acquired via an internal grant. OUTCOMES: The pilot clinic reopened in September 2020. Over the first 13 weeks of operation, 44 unique patients received care across 98 visits. Of these visits, 21 were in-person only with a clinical student and preceptor, while 77 also used the hybrid telehealth model to connect via iPad with a preclinical student. Patient visit volume was approximately 35%C40% of the preCCOVID-19 level. Of the 58 total volunteers, 11 were preclinical students who participated remotely. NEXT STEPS: Three additional JeffHOPE clinic sites have reopened since December 2020 using this hybrid telehealth model. Patient feedback, via surveys and interviews, will determine which components are retained. Other SRFCs should be encouraged to innovate and develop plans for safe resumption of services, with an appropriate approach and organizational support, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.","output":"Reopening a Student-Run Free Clinic During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Provide Care for People Experiencing Homelessness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic began 2 years ago, the scientific community has swiftly worked to understand the transmission, pathogenesis, and immune response of this virus to implement public health policies and ultimately project an end to the pandemic.

Health organizations worldwide have recommended numerous preventive health behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. Yet, considerable variability exists in individual-level adherence to these recommendations. Mindfulness has been associated with greater engagement in health promotive behavior (e.g., physical activity, healthy eating), and may serve as an individual difference factor that encourages adherence. However, no study to date has examined the extent to which mindfulness is associated with preventive health behaviors during a global pandemic. The purpose of the present study was to assess the relations between mindfulness and recommended preventive health behaviors for COVID-19. A national U.S. sample (N = 353; M age = 41.47 years, range: 19-84; 50.2% female) completed an online survey via Amazon's Mechanical Turk from April 3rd to 15th, 2020, including measures of mindfulness and frequency of avoiding touching one's face, handwashing, disinfecting/cleaning frequently used surfaces, social distancing, and self-quarantining. Personality, health risk, and demographic factors were also assessed to test the unique association between mindfulness and preventive health behaviors. Mindfulness was significantly correlated with greater engagement in all of the COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. However, when accounting for demographics, health risk, and personality, mindfulness was only uniquely associated with engagement in social distancing. This research highlights mindfulness as an individual-level characteristic associated with engagement in COVID-19 preventive health behavior and may inform future prevention efforts aimed at improving adherence to recommendations for curbing the spread of infectious disease.","output":"Mindfulness and engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The deleterious effects relating to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers has now been widely established. Understanding how COVID-19 affects their work and life is complex and multidimensional. This longitudinal study describes the critical stressors and how they manifest within both the work and larger social environment for nurses and midwives in Tasmania, Australia. Methods This longitudinal, descriptive survey explores the trajectory of the psychological health of Tasmanian public sector nurses and midwives during the COIVD-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed at 3 timepoints over a 12-month period and consisted of a battery of psychological tests which included the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, together with free text comments. Analysis The associations between outcome and predictor variables were assessed using mixed effects linear regression and linear mixed model analyses. Free text comments were themed. Results High levels of stress and mental exhaustion were attributed to threatened workplace team culture; compromised quality of patient care; the impact on family, home, financial and economic domains; lack of clear communication; issues surrounding personal protective equipment; and female gender. Study data show younger nurses and midwives suffered higher levels of stress and mental exhaustion than older. Conclusion This study highlights the need for stable and functional relationships at home and at work for nurses and midwives. Factors which will help preserve the mental health of nurses and midwives include strong workplace culture with ongoing processes to monitor organisational burnout; building resilience, particularly among younger nurses and midwives; protection of healthcare worker safety; clear communication processes and supporting stable and functional relationships at home.

Additionally, risk factors of worst severity and fatality were studied. Moreover, factors were compared based on three points: early severity, worst severity and fatality. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using data entered in a Japan nationwide COVID-19 inpatient registry, COVIREGI-JP. SETTING: As of 28 September 2020, 10480 cases from 802 facilities have been registered. Participating facilities cover a wide range of hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are admitted in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Participants who had a positive test result on any applicable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were admitted to participating healthcare facilities. A total of 3829 cases were identified from 16 January to 31 May 2020, of which 3376 cases were included in this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was severe or nonsevere on admission, determined by the requirement of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, SpO2 or respiratory rate. Secondary outcome was the worst severity during hospitalisation, judged by the requirement of oxygen and/orinvasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Risk factors for severity on admission were older age, men, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease or dialysis, solid tumour and hyperlipidaemia did not influence severity on admission; however, it influenced worst severity. Fatality rates for obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were relatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study segregated the comorbidities influencing severity and death. It is possible that risk factors for severity on admission, worst severity and fatality are not consistent and may be propelled by different factors. Specifically, while hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity had major effect on worst severity, their impact was mild on fatality in the Japanese population. Some studies contradict our results; therefore, detailed analyses, considering in-hospital treatments, are needed for validation.

It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. OBJECTIVE We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. METHODS This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. RESULTS Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.562.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. CONCLUSION HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted. Psychological support should be offered to HCWs who are positive contacts.","output":"A descriptive study of the psychological experience of health care workers in close contact with a person with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reasoning is a fundamental capability for harnessing valuable insight, knowledge and patterns from knowledge graphs.

Methods Four patients with moderate and elevated EUROSCORE II, underwent to 2 and 3 vessel myocardial revascularization, three patients were undertaken Off-pump and the last one On-pump, using the same anesthetic/analgesic technique to assess pain control, opioid requirement in 48 hours, hemodynamical stability, time at the intensive care unit, delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Standard basic and invasive monitoring was used and a sedline monitor to measure hypnotic depth. In a sitted position a bilateral erector spinae block (ESPB) guided by ultrasound was placed at T6 and T7 level with a 17G Tuohy needle, through which 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine + 10 ml of 0.5% lidocaine without epinephrine was administered, with a catheter placement to continue analgesic management in postoperative period. Anesthetic induction was performed with dexmedetomidine at 0.6 mcg/kg/h during preoxygenation for 5 minutes, lidocaine at 1 mg/kg, Propofol at 1 to 1.5 mg/kg, rocuronium between 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg, dexamethasone 8 mg and the first paracetamol dose of 15 mg/kg was given. The maintenance was target with sedline monitor using PSI and performed with sevoflurane between 0.7 and 0.8 CAM, dexmedetomidine between 0.4 and 0.6 mcg/kg/h, ketamine 0.2 mg/kg/h and within the skin closure the infusion through erector spinae catheters was started between 5-8 ml/h of bilateral 0.125% bupivacaine, continued with paracetamol 15 mg/kg every 8 hours. The protocol considered using opioids as a rescue therapy with hydromorphone or morphine according to pain, quantifying the requirement in the first 48 hours. Results Pain assessment through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) showed peak value at 24 hours (VAS mean value of 7), with lower levels at first 12 and 48 hours (mean values of 3 and 4 respectively). Correspondingly, opioid use was increased in the first 24 hours, a mean of 6,9 mg between morphine equivalent doses, with a posterior drop (a mean value of 1,6 mg) in all patients but one. All patients required vasopressor and inotropic in two cases, however with low doses and adequate progressive withdrawal. No patient presented PONV or delirium in the first 48 hours. Discussion Opioid-free anesthesia is a feasible strategy in patients undergoing CABG surgery, it gives an adequate depth anesthetic parameters keeping adequate hemodynamic stability, with an optimal control of both endocrine and metabolic changes and having acceptable time of stay in the intensive care unit with no increase in morbidity and mortality outcomes.

RNA granules control RNA metabolism and comprise a large class of condensates that are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and RNA molecules. Many RNA granule proteins are composed of both modular domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) having low amino acid sequence complexity. Phase separation of these molecules likely plays an important role in the generation and stability of RNA granules. To understand how folded domains and IDRs can cooperate to modulate LLPS, we generated a series of engineered proteins. These were based on fusions of an IDR derived from the RNA granule protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) to a multivalent poly-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a poly-prolineCrich-motif (polyPRM) ligand. We found that the wild-type IDR promotes LLPS of the polySH3CpolyPRM system, decreasing the phase separation threshold concentration by 8-fold. Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues in Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser motifs of the IDR reduced this effect, depending on the number but not on the position of these substitutions. Mutating all tyrosines to non-aromatic residues or phosphorylating the IDR raised the phase separation threshold above that of the unmodified polySH3CpolyPRM pair. These results show that low-complexity IDRs can modulate LLPS both positively and negatively, depending on the degree of aromaticity and phosphorylation status. Our findings provide plausible mechanisms by which these sequences could alter RNA granule properties on evolutionary and cellular timescales.","output":"Intrinsically disordered sequences enable modulation of protein phase separation through distributed tyrosine motifs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development. METHOD: Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. RESULTS: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p < 0.001, ?2 partial = 0.08.

The diffusion of misinformation becomes more problematic when it addresses issues related to health, as it can affect people at both the individual and population levels. Through the ideas proposed by cultural evolution theory, in this study, we seek to understand the dynamics of disseminating messages (cultural traits) with untrue content (maladaptive traits). For our investigation, we used the scenario caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a model. The instability caused by the pandemic provides a good model for the study of adapted and maladaptive traits, as the information can directly affect individual and population fitness. Through data collected on the Twitter platform (259,176 tweets) and using machine learning techniques and web scraping, we built a predictive model to analyze the following questions: (1) Is false information more shared? (2) Is false information more adopted? (3) Do people with social prestige influence the dissemination of maladaptive traits of COVID-19? We observed that fake news features contained in messages with false information were shared and adopted as unblemished messages. We also observed that social prestige was not a determining factor for the diffusion of maladaptive traits. Even with the ability to allow connections between individuals participating in social media, some factors such as attachment to cultural traits and the formation of social bubbles can favor isolation and decrease connectivity between individuals. Consequently, in the scenario of isolation between groups and low connectivity between individuals, there is a reduction in cultural exchange between people, which interferes with the dynamics of the selection of cultural traits. Thus, maladaptive (harmful) traits are favored and maintained in the cultural system. We also argue that the local Brazilian cultural context can be a determining factor for maintaining maladaptive traits. We conclude that in an unstable (pandemic) scenario, the information transmitted on Twitter is not reliable in relation to the increase in fitness, which may occur because of the low cultural exchange promoted by the personalization of the social network and cultural context of the population.

In the Chareidi ('ultra-orthodox') religious community, for example, rates of COVID-19 transmission and dissemination are above average compared with other communities within the same countries. While viral spread in densely populated communities is common during pandemics, several reasons have been suggested to explain the blatant flouting of public health regulations. It is easy to fault the Chareidi population for their proliferation of COVID-19, partly due to their avoidance of social media and internet aversion. However, the question remains: who is to blame for their community crisis? The ethical argument suggests that from a public health perspective, the physician needs to reach out and share medical knowledge with the community. The public's best interests are critical in a pandemic and should supersede any considerations of cultural differences. By all indications, therefore, the physician has an ethical obligation to promote population healthcare and share medical knowledge based on ethical concepts of beneficence, non-maleficence, utilitarian ethics as well as social, procedural and distributive justice. This includes the ethical duty to reduce health disparities and convey the message that individual responsibility for health has repercussions within the context of broader social accountability.

Furthermore, multiple injuries to different body parts of the rider are seldom analyzed. This study focuses on comparing anatomical injury measures such as the injury severity score (ISS) and the new injury severity score (NISS) in capturing injuries of multiple injured riders and examining the discriminatory capabilities of the ISS and NISS in predicting clinical outcomes post motorcycle crash. METHODS The study harnessed unique and comprehensive injury data on 322 riders from the US DOT Federal Highway Administration's Motorcycle Crash Causation Study (MCCS). Detailed exploratory analysis is performed and discrete/ordered statistical models are estimated for three clinical outcomes: mortality risk, trauma risk, and trauma status. RESULTS Around 9% of the riders died and 45% of the riders had injuries. Around 36% of the riders were hospitalized, disabled, or institutionalized. While a very strong dependence was found between ISS and NISS, ISS underestimated injuries sustained by riders. Statistical models for mortality risk revealed that a unit increase in the ISS and NISS was correlated with a 1.18 and 1.17 times increase in the odds of mortality, respectively. Moreover, a unit increase in ISS and NISS values was correlated with a higher trauma risk by 1.48 and 1.36 times, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the probability of a rider being hospitalized or disabled/institutionalized increases with an increase in the NISS. Conclusions and practical applications: The NISS exhibits significantly better calibration and discriminatory ability in differentiating survivors and non-survivors and in predicting trauma status - underscoring the importance of accounting for microscopic body-part-level injury data in motorcycle crashes. We consider that compared with the KABCO scale, the ISS and NISS are more nuanced scores that can better measure the overall injury intensity and can lead to more targeted countermeasures.","output":"Toward better measurement of traffic injuries - Comparison of anatomical injury measures in predicting the clinical outcomes in motorcycle crashes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in diversion of healthcare resources to the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: (1) venous thromboembolism (VTE), (2) chronic venous disease, (3) vascular anomalies, (4) venous trauma, (5) venous compression and (6) lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage.

He recognized, however, that widespread anti-essentialism presented a significant barrier to such an approach. The aim of this article is to introduce a theory that challenges these anti-essentialist objections. The notion of natural kinds presents a modest form of essentialism that can serve as the basis for a foundationalist philosophy of medicine. The notion of a natural kind is neither static nor reductionistic. Disease can be understood as making necessary reference to living natural kinds without invoking the claim that diseases themselves are natural kinds. The idea that natural kinds have a natural disposition to flourish as the kinds of things that they are provides a telos to which to tether the notion of disease C an objective telos that is broader than mere survival and narrower than subjective choice. It is argued that while nosology is descriptive and may have therapeutic implications, disease classification is fundamentally explanatory. Sickness and illness, while referring to the same state of affairs, can be distinguished from disease phenomenologically. Scientific and diagnostic fallibility in making judgments about diseases do not diminish the objectivity of this notion of disease. Diseases are things, not kinds. Injury is a concept parallel to disease that also makes necessary reference to living natural kinds. These ideas provide a new possibility for the development of a philosophy of medicine with implications for medical ethics.","output":"Diseases and Natural Kinds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists have had to work under stressful conditions due to the nature of their work. Personal protection equipment (PPE) has become mandatory for work in the dentistry field. This study aimed to examine dentists' practices and attitudes regarding the use of PPE and the associated drawbacks and cost implications during the pandemic. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was used and was divided into five sections dedicated to collect demographic variables and to examine the dentists' practices, attitudes toward PPE, drawbacks, and cost of using PPE. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare different sections of the questionnaire and linear regression was used to determine the predictors of the dentists' practices and attitudes toward PPE. Results: The mean of practices regarding use of PPE was 5.41  1.71 (median 6), attitude toward using PPE scored 2.26  0.90 (median 2), while the means of drawbacks and cost recorded equal scores of 5.22  1.24 (median 5) and 1.68  0.74 (median 2), respectively. The recently graduated dentists, those with postgraduate degrees and those working in the private sector demonstrated higher levels of practices on PPE than their counterparts. Regression analysis revealed that practices of PPE can be predicted on the basis of qualifications and work place, whereas attitude toward PPE is significantly influenced by qualification only. Conclusions: The study participants demonstrated satisfactory levels of practices and positive attitudes toward PPE.

However, little is known about their interactions with neutrophils and how this might contribute to injury. Here, it is shown that histone H4 acts as neutrophil activator by inducing hydrogen peroxide production, degranulation, cell adhesion, and IL-8 generation. Histone H4 caused permeabilization of the neutrophil membrane (a phenomenon described in other cell types) leading to accelerated cell death. H4 caused sustained rise in neutrophil intracellular calcium that is necessary for respiratory burst activation and degranulation. Convincing evidence was not found for TLRs or ATP receptors in H4 mediated activation. However, pertussis toxin and wortmannin (inhibitors of G protein and PI3K) inhibited H4-induced hydrogen peroxide production and degranulation. These studies suggest that release of histone H4 in sites of infection or inflammation may potentiate neutrophil activation and promote additional inflammatory responses. These studies may provide a better basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies to block neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) and H4-related pathology in sepsis and various forms of lung injury including that induced by viruses like influenza or SAR-CoV2.","output":"Histone H4 directly stimulates neutrophil activation through membrane permeabilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-triggered mortality is significantly higher in older than in younger populations worldwide. Alzheimers disease (AD) is related to aging and was recently reported to be among the major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in older people. The symptomatology of COVID-19 indicates that lethal outcomes of infection rely on neurogenic mechanisms. The present review compiles the available knowledge pointing to the convergence of COVID-19 complications with the mechanisms of autonomic dysfunctions in AD and aging. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prone to neuroinvasion from the lung along the vagus nerve up to the brainstem autonomic nervous centers involved in the coupling of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms. The brainstem autonomic network allows SARS-CoV-2 to trigger a neurogenic switch to hypertension and hypoventilation, which may act in synergy with aging- and AD-induced dysautonomias, along with an inflammatory storm. The lethal outcomes of COVID-19, like in AD and unhealthy aging, likely rely on a critical hypoactivity of the efferent vagus nerve cholinergic pathway, which is involved in lowering cardiovascular pressure and systemic inflammation tone. We further discuss the emerging evidence supporting the use of 1) the non-invasive stimulation of vagus nerve as an additional therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19, and 2) the demonstrated vagal tone index, i.e., heart rate variability, via smartphone-based applications as a non-serological low-cost diagnostic of COVID-19.

To understand such genetic effects, we examine HAP4, a well-studied transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that functions by forming a tetramer with HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5. Deletion of HAP4 results in highly pleiotropic gene expression responses, some of which are clustered in related cellular processes (clustered effects) while most are distributed randomly across diverse cellular processes (distributed effects). Strikingly, the distributed effects that account for much of HAP4 pleiotropy tend to be non-heritable in a population, suggesting they have few evolutionary consequences. Indeed, these effects are poorly conserved in closely related yeasts. We further show substantial overlaps of clustered effects, but not distributed effects, among the four genes encoding the HAP2/3/4/5 tetramer. This pattern holds for other biochemically characterized yeast protein complexes or metabolic pathways. Examination of a set of cell morphological traits of the deletion lines yields consistent results. Hence, only some deletion effects of a gene support related biochemical understandings with the rest being often pleiotropic and evolutionarily decoupled from the gene's normal functions.

The virus causes multiple epithelial tumors on the fishs skin and fins that are liable for more than 50% of the mortality rate of fish around the world. Till now, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine candidates have been developed that can block the progression of the disease caused by the pathogen. It was found that the 582-amino-acid (aa) residues long internal structural gag polyprotein of the virus plays an important role in virus budding and virion maturation outside of the cell. Inhibition of the protein can block the budding and virion maturation process and can be developed as an antiviral drug candidate against the virus. Therefore, the study aimed to identify potential natural antiviral drug candidates from the tropical mangrove marine plant Avicennia alba, which will be able to block the budding and virion maturation process by inhibiting the activity of the gag protein of the virus. Initially, a homology modeling approach was applied to identify the 3D structure, followed by refinement and validation of the protein. The refined protein structures were then utilized for molecular docking simulation. Eleven phytochemical compounds have been isolated from the marine plant and docked against the virus gag polyprotein. Three compounds, namely Friedlein (CID244297), Phytosterols (CID12303662), and 1-Triacontanol (CID68972) have been selected based on their docking score ?8.5 kcal/mol, ?8.0 kcal/mol and ?7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, and were evaluated through ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion), and toxicity properties. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied to confirm the binding stability of the protein-ligands complex structure. The ADME and toxicity analysis reveal the efficacy and non-toxic properties of the compounds, where MD simulation confirmed the binding stability of the selected three compounds with the targeted protein. This computational study revealed the virtuous value of the selected three compounds against the targeted gag polyprotein and will be effective and promising antiviral candidates against the pathogen in a significant and worthwhile manner.

Furthermore, conflicting data exist regarding the vertical transmission of coronavirus. Therefore, a hospital-based study was conducted to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 infected pregnant women. Methodology A hospital-based retrospective observational study was conducted between July-December 2020 in Rajarshi Dashrath Autonomous State Medical College, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, a designated level-2 COVID-19 Hospital. A total of 37 confirmed COVID-19 positive pregnant women (mean age 27.5  05 years) of more than 28 weeks of gestation were included in this study to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on maternal and perinatal outcomes. Maternal symptoms related to COVID-19, comorbidities, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), leaking per vagina, mode of delivery, preterm deliveries, and maternal deaths were recorded. Birth weight of newborns, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, neonatal illness, neonatal deaths, and COVID-19 testing reports were recorded. Result Out of 37 COVID-19 positive pregnant women, 27 (72.9%) women were asymptomatic, nine (24.4%) women were having mild disease, and one (2.7%) developed severe disease requiring ICU admission. No maternal deaths were observed. Twenty-six (70.3%) women were delivered by caesarean section, 11 (29.7%) women by normal vaginal delivery, four (10.8%) were of leaking per vagina. Among newborns, five (13.5%) were preterm, one (2.7%) newborn require NICU admission, two (5.4%) were tested COVID-19 positive on the 5th day of life but were asymptomatic, and four (10.8%) newborns developed a fever but were COVID-19 negative. One case (2.7%) was of stillbirth. No neonatal deaths were observed. Conclusion The present study did not reveal any direct evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through the placenta and during vaginal delivery, but the possibility of mother-to-child infection cannot be completely ignored. SARS-CoV-2 infection during late pregnancy may have a maternal and neonatal impact. COVID-19 infections in late pregnancy might lead to an increased incidence of caesarean deliveries as observed in the present study. This study reveals that most of the COVID-19 positive pregnant women remained asymptomatic or had mild infections. Hence, efforts to limit exposure to COVID-19 of pregnant women should be strengthened for saving mother and child.","output":"Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes of Hospitalized COVID-19 Positive Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract 1: Phylodynamic models use pathogen genome sequence data to infer epidemiological dynamics.

In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results. 4: We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth-death models.

OBJECTIVES: In the current situation of emerging viral disease, there is no specific vaccine, or any therapeutics available for SARS-CoV-2, thus there is a dire need to design a potential vaccine to combat the virus by developing immunity in the population. The purpose of present study was to develop a potential vaccine by targeting B and T-cell epitopes using bioinformatics approaches. METHODS: B- and T-cell epitopes are predicted from novel M protein-SARS-CoV-2 for the development of a unique multiple epitope vaccine by applying bioinformatics approaches. These epitopes were analyzed and selected for their immunogenicity, antigenicity scores, and toxicity in correspondence to their ability to trigger immune response. In combination to epitopes, best multi-epitope of potential immunogenic property was constructed. The epitopes were joined using EAAAK, AAY and GPGPG linkers. RESULTS: The constructed vaccine showed good results of worldwide population coverage and promising immune response. This constructed vaccine was subjected to in-silico immune simulations by C-ImmSim. Chimeric protein construct was cloned into PET28a (+) vector for expression study in Escherichia coli using snapgene. CONCLUSION: This vaccine design proved effective in various computer-based immune response analysis as well as showed good population coverage.

Reforms include changes in learning environment (for students), and new approaches to teaching methods (for teaching staff). It is worth mentioning that lately most of the teaching staff have also become 'students' while acquiring new skills of working with information technologies in E-learning environment. The current research was held on the basis of two universities, the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University) and Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI University). The aim of the study is to analyze students' and educators' attitude (expectations, readiness, experience obtained) towards the e-learning environment and to identify the essence of cognitive abilities development for students in the format of forced distance learning. The research included 234 respondents (134 from MAI University and 100 from MGIMO University) who were to take part in two questionnaires (one for educators, and the other for students of foreign languages) to get their attitude to the forced substitution of the traditional, in-person, form of education;benefits remote telecommuting classes can offer;virtual learning and educational environment;new skills and abilities e-learning environment require and develop. The research has also proved an increase in digital 'literacy' of both educators and students.

However, the impact of high media attention about vaccine-related side effects on the utilization of health care is unknown. We aimed to assess whether utilization of health care services for newly vaccinated health care workers changed after media attention about fatal side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11th, 2021, and whether changes differed by age, sex, or occupation. METHODS: We utilized individual-level data on health care use, vaccination, employment, and demographics available in the Norwegian emergency preparedness register Beredt C19. In all 99,899 health care workers in Norway who were vaccinated with AstraZeneca between February 11th and March 11th, we used an event-study design with a matched comparison group to compare the change in primary and inpatient specialist care use from 14 days before to 14 days after the information shock on March 11th, 2021. RESULTS: Primary health care use increased with 8.2 daily consultations per 1000 health care workers (95% CI 7.51 to 8.89) the week following March 11th for those vaccinated with AstraZeneca (n = 99,899), compared with no increase for the unvaccinated comparison group (n = 186,885). Utilization of inpatient care also increased with 0.8 daily hospitalizations per 1000 health care workers (95% CI 0.37 to 1.23) in week two after March 11th. The sharpest increase in daily primary health care use in the first week after March 11th was found for women aged 18C44 (10.6 consultations per 1000, 95% CI 9.52 to 11.68) and for cleaners working in the health care sector (9.8 consultations per 1000, 95% CI 3.41 to 16.19).

Evidence-based outpatient treatment based on compression therapy is frequently not implemented. The Ulcus Cruris Care project was established to develop a disease management concept to improve outpatient treatment for patients with VLU in German primary care. For this purpose, a multifaceted intervention was conceived consisting of an online training for general practitioners and medical assistants, standardized treatment recommendations, e-learning and print-based information for patients, and a software support for case management. The main aims of the Ulcus Cruris Care intervention are to promote standardized treatment according to current scientific knowledge, to facilitate case management for VLU patients exerted by medical assistants, and to support patient education and participation in the treatment process. The UCC trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ulcus Cruris Care intervention. METHODS: The UCC trial is a prospective cluster-randomized controlled multicenter trial. Fifty GP practices are intended to be recruited and randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arm. Patients with venous leg ulcers will be recruited by participating GP practices, to include a total of 63 patients in each arm. The primary outcome is time to ulcer healing. Secondary outcomes comprise number and sizes of ulcers, recurrence, pain intensity according to the visual analog scale, health-related quality of life according to EQ-5D-5L, depressiveness according to Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), patient satisfaction according to the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC-5A) query, and adherence to VLU treatment. The outcome analysis of the UCC trial is accompanied by a health economic analysis and a process evaluation.

Our first approach is the calculation of predictable and unpredictable portions of amino-acid pairs in a protein, and the second is the calculation of amino-acid distribution rank in a protein. Both approaches provide quantitative measures to present a protein, which we have used to study a number of proteins with numerous mutations such as p53 proteins. More recently, we focussed our efforts on analyzing the proteins mutating frequently over time such as hemagglutinins of influenza A viruses. In this review we summarise our findings and their implications for hemagglutinin mutations in combination with some newly available data. Our approaches throw light on the true nature of genetic heterogeneity of influenza virus hemagglutinins; that is, the protein variability is highly relevant to its amino-acid construction. Using these approaches, we can monitor new mutations from influenza virus hemagglutinins and may predict their mutations in the future.","output":"Mutation trend of hemagglutinin of influenza A virus: a review from a computational mutation viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We aimed to understand the challenges facing children's surgical care providers globally and realistic interventions to mitigate the catastrophic impact of COVID-19 on children's surgery. METHODS: Two online Action Planning Forums (APFs) were organized by the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery (GICS) with a geographically diverse panel representing four children's surgical, anesthesia, and nursing subspecialties. Qualitative analysis was performed to identify codes, themes, and subthemes. RESULTS: The most frequently reported challenges were delayed access to care for children; fear among the public and patients; unavailability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE); diversion of resources toward COVID-19 care; and interruption in student and trainee hands-on education. To address these challenges, panelists recommended human resource and funding support to minimize backlog; setting up international, multi-center studies for systematic data collection specifically for children; providing online educational opportunities for trainees and students in the form of large and small group discussions; developing best practice guidelines; and, most importantly, adapting solutions to local needs. CONCLUSION: Identification of key challenges and interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global children's surgery via an objective, targeted needs assessment serves as an essential first step. Key interventions in these areas are underway.","output":"Online action planning forums to develop a roadmap to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of global children's surgical care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and new variants continue to emerge.

Scientific evidence shows that the middle ear can be a place for the attachment and growth of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, to the best of the author's knowledge, there have been no publications on middle ear discharge as a sample for the determination of the diagnosis of COVID-19. Based on this, the authors would like to explore the possibility of middle ear discharge for COVID-19 test material.

Typically, MP pollution can be detected by various techniques, such as microscopic analysis, density separation, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. However, there are limited studies on disposable face masks and PPE kits. A wide range of marine species ingest MPs in the form of fibers and fragments, which directly affect the environment and human health; thus, more research and development are needed on the effect of MP pollution on human health.

CHRFAM7A, a uniquely human fusion gene, is a negative regulator of &#945;7 nAChR and was unaccounted for in preclinical models. METHODS: Molecular methods: Function of CHRFAM7A alleles was studied in vitro in two disease relevant phenotypic readouts: electrophysiology and A? uptake. Genome edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were used as a model system with the human context. Double blind pharmacogenetic study: We performed double-blind pharmacogenetic analysis on the effect of AChEI therapy based on CHRFAM7A carrier status in two paradigms: response to drug initiation and DMT effect. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used as outcome measure. Change in MMSE score from baseline was compared by 2-tailed T-test. Longitudinal analysis of clinical outcome (MMSE) was performed using a fitted general linear model, based on an assumed autoregressive covariance structure. Model independent variables included age, sex, and medication regimen at the time of the first utilized outcome measure (AChEI alone or AChEI plus memantine), APOE4 carrier status (0, 1 or 2 alleles as categorical variables) and CHRFAM7A genotype. FINDINGS: The direct and inverted alleles have distinct phenotypes. Functional CHRFAM7A allele classifies the population as 25% non-carriers and 75% carriers. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models &#945;7 nAChR mediated A? neurotoxicity. Pharmacological readout translates into both first exposure (pa?=a?0.037) and disease modifying effect (pa?=a?0.0048) in two double blind pharmacogenetic studies. INTERPRETATION: CHRFAM7A accounts for the translational gap in cholinergic strategies in AD. Clinical trials not accounting for this uniquely human genetic factor may have rejected drug candidates that would benefit 25% of AD. Reanalyses of the completed trials using this pharmacogenetic paradigm may identify effective therapy.","output":"CHRFAM7A: A human specific fusion gene, accounts for the translational gap for cholinergic strategies in Alzheimer's disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While all resources have been mobilized to fight COVID-19, this study aimed to analyze the consequences of lockdown and pandemic stress in participants with and without Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). METHODOLOGY: An online survey was proposed to people with or without IBS during the exponential phase of the pandemic in France. The questionnaire included questions about socio-demographic data, conditions of confinement, activities carried out, IBS characteristics, measurement of stress level, consequences on sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and quality of life (both perceived non-specific and specific for IBS). RESULTS/DISCUSSION: From March 31 to April 15, 2020, 304 participants, 232 with IBS and 72 without were included in the survey (mean age: 46.8  16.8 years, female gender: 75.3%). Age, level of education, financial resources, living space per person and activities performed during confinement were identical in both groups. Stress linked to fear of COVID-19, lockdown and financial worries was at the same level in both groups, but the psychological consequences and deterioration of quality of life (QOL) were both higher in IBS participants. In a univariate analysis, teleworking, solitary confinement, and low household resources had a variable impact on the scores of depression, anxiety, fatigue and non-specific perceived QOL, but in a multivariate analysis, the only factor explaining a deterioration of non-specific QOL was the fact of suffering from IBS.

Recently, the usefulness of curdlan has been further explored by the pharmaceutical industry for its potential therapeutic applications. Curdlan has exhibited immunoregulatory and antitumor activity in preclinical settings. It was observed that curdlan can prevent the proliferation of malarial merozoites in vivo; therefore, it may be considered as a promising therapy for the treatment of end-stage malaria. In addition, curdlan has demonstrated potent antiviral effects against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Aedes aegypti virus. It has been suggested that the virucidal properties of curdlans should be extended further for other deadly viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19). The prebiotic property of curdlan would confer beneficial effects on the host by promoting the growth of healthy microbiota in the gut and consequently help to reduce gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, curdlan can be employed in the manufacture of prebiotics for the management of various gastrointestinal dysbiosis problems. Studies on the mechanism of action of curdlan-induced suppression in microbial and tumor cells at the cellular and molecular levels would not only enhance our understanding regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of curdlan but also help in the discovery of new drugs and dietary supplements. The primary focus of this review is to highlight the therapeutic interventions of curdlan as an anticancer, anti-malaria, antiviral, and antibacterial agent in humans.

These effects may be minimized through healthcare use tailored to young survivors needs. Using a cross-sectional study design, we examined the healthcare use of 93 adolescent/young adult cancer survivors (aged 15C39 years), relative to a comparison group of adolescents and young adults recruited from the local community (n = 183). Our cancer survivor group reported greater use of medical and mental health services, and medications during the past six months relative to the comparison group. Our cancer survivor group also reported less psychological distress, and similar work/study participation relative to the comparison group. Survivors who were female, diagnosed with brain/solid tumors and who had finished treatment more recently reported greater healthcare use. Future research is needed to determine whether the healthcare accessed by adolescent and young adult cancer survivors is appropriate and meets their needs. ABSTRACT: Healthcare use (HCU) during survivorship can mitigate adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (aged 15C39 years) risk of medical and psychosocial late effects, but this is understudied. We surveyed 93 Australian AYA post-treatment cancer survivors (M(age) = 22.0 years, SD = 3.5; 55.9% female) and a comparison sample of 183 non-matched AYAs (M(age) = 19.7, SD = 3.2; 70.5% female) on their HCU, medication use, depression/anxiety, and general functioning. Relative to our comparison AYAs, a higher proportion of our survivor group reported medical HCU (community-delivered: 65.6% versus 47.0%, p = 0.003; hospital-delivered: 31.2% versus 20.3%, p = 0.044) and mental HCU (53.8% vs. 23.5%; p < 0.0001) in the past six months. A higher proportion of our survivors reported taking medications within the past six months than our comparison AYAs (61.3% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.003) and taking more types (p < 0.001). Vitamin/supplement use was most common followed by psychotropic medications. Our survivor group reported lower depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (p = 0.003), but similar work/study participation (p = 0.767) to our comparison AYAs. Across groups, psychological distress was associated with higher mental HCU (p = 0.001). Among survivors, those who were female, diagnosed with brain/solid tumors and who had finished treatment more recently reported greater HCU.

METHODS: In this observational study, clinical details of patients with COVID-19, identified by Reverse Transcription C Polymerase Chain Reaction admitted to 4 hospitals in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India were collected from May to November 2020. A total of 845 (n = 423 with diabetes, n = 422 without diabetes) were selected for the analysis. Clinical details, biochemical and radiological investigations, diabetes treatment, intensive care, mortality and other adverse outcomes were recorded. Patients with clinical history of T2DM, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and/or random blood glucose 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) were included. Statistical analyses were done using chi-square or t test and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: At admission, patients with T2DM were older (p < 0.0001), had higher co-morbidities such as coronary artery disease (p = 0.02), hypertension (p < 0.0001), hypothyroidism (p = 0.03) and renal disorders (p = 0.01) than non-diabetes persons. Requirement for intensive care was higher among them. Acute renal injury or failure, pneumonia and myocardial infarction developed in higher percentage of T2DM.

Here we demonstrate that while intranasal administration of influenza virus hemagglutinin vaccine alone was insufficient to induce the vaccine-specific antibody responses, disruption of nasal bacteria by lysozyme or addition of culturable oral bacteria from a healthy human volunteer rescued inability of the nasal bacteria to generate antibody responses to intranasally administered the split-virus vaccine.

Factors that expose HCWs to a differentially high-risk of COVID-19 acquisition are important to elucidate, to enable appropriate public health interventions to mitigate against high risk and reduce adverse outcomes from the infection. We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis to summarise and critically analyse the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 risk factors among HCWs. With no geographical limitation, we included studies, in any country, that reported (i) PCR laboratory diagnosis of COVID19 as an independent variable (ii) one or more COVID-19 risk factors among health care workers with risk estimates (relative risk, odds ratio or harzard ratio) (iii) original, quantitative study design and published in English or Mandarian. Our initial search resulted in 470 articles overall, however, only 10 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 10 studies included in the review, inadequate/lack of protective personal equipment (PPE), performing tracheal intubation (PTI) and gender were the most common risk factors of COVID-19. Based on the random effects adjusted pooled relative risk, HCWs who reported use PPE were 29% (95% CI: 16% to 41%) less likely to test positive for COVID-19. The study also revealed that HCWs who performed tracheal intubations were 34% (95% CI: 14% to 57%) more likely to test positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, this study showed that female HCWs are at 11% higher risk (RR 1.11 95% CI 1.01-1.21) of COVID-19 than their male counterparts. This paper presents initial findings from a living systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, did not yield many studies, however, it revealed a significant insight to better understand COVID-19 risk factors among HCWs; insights important for devising preventive strategies that protect them from this infection.","output":"Risk factors for COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.

Infectivity was maintained on plastic and glass until 120 h and on stainless steel until 72 h. The virus half-life was 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 h on plastic, stainless steel, and glass, respectively. In all cases, titer decay was >99% after drop drying. UV-C irradiation efficiently reduced virus titer (99.99%), with doses ranging from 10.25 to 23.71 mJ/cm(2). Plastic and stainless steel needed higher doses to achieve target reduction. The total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on glass was obtained with the lower dose applied. SARS-CoV-2 survival can be long lasting on inanimate surfaces. It is worth recommending efficient disinfection protocols as a measure of prevention of viral spread.

To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale. METHODS: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C. Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","output":"Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders are Associated with Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By January 2022 over ten billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered worldwide. Concerns about COVID-19 vaccine-associated thrombosis arose after the characterization of a rare prothrombotic condition associated with adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Although mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to VITT, concerns about thrombosis after vaccination persist despite safety data from hundreds of millions of recipients of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. With widespread vaccination some VTE will occur shortly after vaccination by chance alone because VTE is a common condition that affects 1 to 2 in 1000 persons each year. Detailed analysis is required to determine whether these VTE events are coincidental or associated when they occur in close proximity to mRNA vaccine administration. This paper will review what is currently known about rates of VTE after mRNA vaccination in adults, discuss the reasons why uncertainty on this topic persists, and briefly review the implications of these findings for clinical practice and health policy.","output":"No apparent association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and venous thromboembolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation is associated with adverse outcomes after pediatric liver transplant.

A center-level patient-mix deprivation index was defined by the distribution of patient-level deprivation. Centers (n=66) were classified as high or low deprivation if their patient-mix deprivation index was above or below the median across centers.

We used random-effect Cox models to evaluate center-level covariates on graft failure. We modeled center quality using stratified Cox models. In multivariate analysis, each 0.1 increase in the patient-mix deprivation index was associated with increased hazard of graft failure (HR 1.32; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.66).

The interview schedule and coding frame were based on Normalisation Process Theory. Interviews were conducted over the telephone or by video call. Abductive analysis of interview transcripts extended knowledge from previous research to identify, characterize and explain how patient preferences for VC were formed and arranged. RESULTS: Fifty\\\\five participants were included (20 patients, 20 clinicians, 15 managers). Key mechanisms that contribute to the formation of patient preferences were identified. These were: (a) context for the consultation (normative expectations, relational expectations, congruence and potential); (b) the available alternatives and the implementation process (coherence, cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring). Patient preferences are mediated by the clinician and organisational preferences through the influence of the consultation context, available alternatives and the implementation process. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the cumulative analysis of five empirical studies investigating patient preferences for VC before and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic as VC transitioned from an experimental clinic to a compulsory form of service delivery. This study has identified mechanisms that explain how preferences for VC come about and how these relate to organisational and clinician preferences.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, interventional study on six consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis and were managed at two tertiary ophthalmic referral centers in India between August 1 and December 15, 2020. Diagnosis of mucormycosis was based on clinical features, culture, and histopathology from sinus biopsy. Patients were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B with addition of posaconazole and surgical debridement of necrotic tissue.

A highly specific lateral flow test kit for SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG+IgM antibodies was developed as a home-test assay with a LOD at 50IU/mL of pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PVNT). 2. After full vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines, 96.6% of the vaccinees successfully achieved the seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG+IgM antibody. 3. Even though the S1 antibody level in 88% of the vaccinees vaccinated with inactivated virus vaccines dropped below the detection 2-6 months layer, one boost could quickly raise the S1 antibody titer above 50IU/mL, indicating the initial vaccination was successful and immunization memory was developed. Abstract Background: More than ten novel COVID-19 vaccines have been approved with protections against SARS-CoV-2 infections ranges between 52-95%. It is of great interest to the vaccinees who have received the COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine developers and authorities to identify the non-responders in a timely manner so intervention can take place by either giving additional boosts of the same vaccine or switching to a different vaccine to improve the protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. A robust correlation was seen between binding antibody titer and efficacy (p=0.93) in the clinic studies of 7 COVID-19 vaccines, so it is of urgency to develop a simple POCT for vaccinees to self-assess their immune response at home. Methods. Using CHO cell-expressed full length SARS-CoV2 S1 protein as coating antigen on colloidal gold particles, a SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG-IgM antibody lateral flow test kit (POCT) was developed. The test was validated with negative human sera collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreaks, and blood samples from human subjects prior, during, and post-immunization of COVID-19 vaccines. Results. The specificity of the POCT was 99.0%, as examined against 947 normal human sera and 20 whole blood samples collected pre-immunization. The limit of detection was 50 IU/mL of pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PVNT) using human anti-SARS-2 neutralizing standards from convalescent sera. The sensitivity of POCT for SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein antibody IgG-IgM was compared with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody ELISA and determined to be 100% using 23 blood samples from vaccinated human subjects and 10 samples from non-vaccinated ones. Whole blood samples were collected from 119 human subjects (ages between 22-61 years) prior to, during, and post-vaccination of five different COVID-19 vaccines. Among them, 115 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies (showing positive at least once) and 4 people tested negative (tested negative at least twice on different days), demonstrating 96.64% of seroconversion after full-vaccination. 92.3% (36/39) of the human subjects who were younger than 45 achieved seroconversion within 2 weeks while only 57.1% (4/7) of subjects older than 45 tested positive for S1 antibodies, suggesting that younger people develop protection much faster than older ones. Even though the S1 antibody level in 88% of human subjects vaccinated with inactivated virus dropped below 50 IU/mL two months later, one boost could quickly raise the S1 antibody titer above 50 IU/mL of PVNT, indicates that the initial vaccination was successful and immunization memory was developed. Conclusion: Using the lateral flow tests of SARS-CoV2 S1 IgG+IgM, vaccinated human subjects can easily self-assess the efficacy of their vaccination at home. The vaccine developer could quickly identify those non-responders and give them an additional boost to improve the efficacy of their vaccines. Vaccinees who failed in response could switch to different types of COVID-19 vaccines since there are more than 10 COVID-19 vaccines approved using three different platform technologies.","output":"Self-assessment of COVID-19 vaccination efficacy using a simple POCT for SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein antibody IgG-IgM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The role of epicardial fat (eFat)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) has never been studied. We tested the hypothesis that eFat-EVs transmit proinflammatory, profibrotic, and proarrhythmic molecules that induce atrial myopathy and fibrillation. Methods: We collected eFat specimens from patients with (n=32) and without AF (n=30) during elective heart surgery. eFat samples were grown as organ cultures, and the culture medium was collected every two days. We then isolated and purified eFat-EVs from the culture medium, and analyzed the EV number, size, morphology, specific markers, encapsulated cytokines, proteome, and miRNAs. Next, we evaluated the biological effects of unpurified and purified EVs on atrial mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. To establish a causal association between eFat-EVs and vulnerability to AF, we modeled AF in vitro using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Results: Microscopic examination revealed excessive inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis in fresh and cultured eFat tissues. Cultured explants from patients with AF secreted more EVs and harbored greater amounts of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, as well as profibrotic miRNA, than those without AF. The proteomic analysis confirmed the distinctive profile of purified eFat-EVs from patients with AF. In vitro, purified and unpurified eFat-EVs from patients with AF had a greater effect on proliferation and migration of human MSCs and ECs, compared to eFat-EVs from patients without AF. Finally, while eFat-EVs from patients with and without AF shortened the action potential duration of iCMs, only eFat-EVs from patients with AF induced sustained reentry (rotor) in iCMs. Conclusions: We show, for the first time, a distinctive proinflammatory, profibrotic, and proarrhythmic signature of eFat-EVs from patients with AF.

The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic carriers to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accumulating evidence has shown that COVID-19 may be associated with multiple organ complications including cardiac injury, viral myositis and neurological deficits. Numerous laboratory biomarkers including lymphocytes, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK) have been associated with the prognostic outcomes of patients with COVID-19. However, dynamic correlations between levels of biomarkers and clinical course have not been studied. Herein, we report a 74-year-old female patient with severe COVID-19 which progressed to ARDS requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The laboratory findings showed lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers and CK. She received intensive therapy with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin with limited effects. Immunomodulatory treatments with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin and baricitinib were prescribed with satisfactory biochemical, radiographic and clinical recovery. We found an interesting correlation between serum CK elevation and inflammatory biomarkers, which reflected clinical improvement. This case demonstrates that inflammatory biomarkers, cytokines, and CK level correlated with disease severity and treatment response, and combined use of intravenous immunoglobulin and baricitinib is a potential treatment in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Combined intravenous immunoglobulin and baricitinib treatment for severe COVID-19 with rhabdomyolysis: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular basis of the wide clinical heterogeneity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unknown. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may have a role in the lung damage and regeneration that occur in severe patients. We studied serum MMP3 and MMP9 as potential biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, in 108 hospitalized patients with different World Health Organization (WHO) severity stage and in 48 controls. At hospital admission, serum MMP3 was increased in COVID-19 patients with a significant trend along the progression of the WHO stage, while serum levels of MMP9 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients with no correlation with disease severity. At 1 week from hospitalization, MMP3 was reduced, suggesting an early pathogenic role of the protein in lung inflammation, while MMP9 levels were further increased, indicating a late role of the protein in the inflammatory process, specifically during the repairing phase. Furthermore, serum MMP9 was positively correlated with serum interleukin-6, myeloperoxidase, and circulating neutrophils and monocytes number. In conclusion, serum MMP3 may help to early predict the severity of COVID-19 and both proteins, MMP3 and MMP9, may contribute to define severe COVID-19 patients that may benefit from a targeted therapy on MMPs.","output":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 3 and 9 as biomarkers of severity in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management of COVID-19 patients with humoral immunodeficiency is challenging.

On short timescales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, whereas long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in both the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through reparameterization. We derive a nonlinear dependence of the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] on the susceptible population fraction [Formula: see text]. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of long-lasting herd immunity: Subsequent waves may emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven by, for example, seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic and from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest hit areas, such as New York City, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.","output":"Time-dependent heterogeneity leads to transient suppression of the COVID-19 epidemic, not herd immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to investigate the evolution of public sector communication before and after the Covid-19 crisis that has strongly impacted governmental institutions, public policy, contemporary society, and media ecologies After a review of the main characteristics of public sector communication, the article proposes an interpretative and dynamic model to better understand the new challenges for public institutions The model introduces ethics as the new, primary driver for public sector communication to surround all decisions, pointing out the need for transparent, authentic participation and dialogue to build trust Focusing on two dimensions (trust/distrust, openness/closedness), the authors investigate the main trajectories of change for public sector communication, conceiving the three pillars of open government (transparency, participation and collaboration) as strategic values for improving the quality and efficacy of communication In this time of uncertainty, the new trajectories of communication should fully embrace an ethical approach in order to become resilient, able to respond to citizens' needs and expectations, and to maintain responsible relationships with media, varied strategic publics, and a rapidly changing global community","output":"Re-Connecting Voices.

Following 11 weeks of HFD regimes in Wistar rats, elevated plus-maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tasks were used to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior and spatial and passive learning and memory, respectively. Daily intraperitoneal injection of NaHS was done during the dietary regimen. Serum and hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS)) were measured. We demonstrated that treatment with NaHS ameliorated the impairment in the retrieval of reference memory and passive avoidance learning. Moreover, HFD increased anxiety-like behavior, which was reversed by the administration of NaHS. Additionally, the increase in MDA and TOS and the decrease in TAC induced by HFD in the serum and hippocampus were significantly reduced following administration of NaHS.

Liver transplantation is currently one of the most efficient approaches to save patients with liver failure, which is often associated with hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. IR injury is exacerbated by hepatic steatosis, yet the mechanism remains elusive. Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALD and NAFLD. Though necroptosis plays an important role in IR injury of high fat diet - induced steatotic livers, the role of necroptosis in IR injury of ethanol - induced steototic livers has not been investigated. In the present study, we used chronic plus binge alcohol (Gao-binge) feeding followed by IR surgery to investigate IR liver injury with ethanol-associated steatosis. We found that the levels of key necroptotic proteins MLKL and RIP3 increased in alcohol-fed mouse livers. Moreover, we observed increased liver injury after IR in control diet-fed mice, which was further exacerbated by alcohol feeding based on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and TUNEL staining of necrotic cells. Hepatic neutrophil infiltration also increased in alcohol-fed mice after IR surgery.

RESULTS: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic [r(107) = 0.26, p = 0.006], which were higher in females than in males [t(107) = ?3.56, p < 0.001].

The conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation are gained and, in particular, exact Turing domain is found in the two parameters space. Furthermore, numerical results show that force of infection, namely , plays an important role in the spatial pattern. More specifically, different patterns emerge as  increases. The mathematical analysis and numerical results well extend the finding of pattern formation in the epidemic models and may well explain the field observed in some areas.","output":"Pattern formation of an epidemic model with diffusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"a?Research in cyberpsychology is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.a?COVID-19 elicits new challenges for cyrberpsychology research.a?Online technologies will be part of the solution to mitigate the crisis.","output":"Cyberpsychology research and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common emergencies in general surgery worldwide. During the pandemic, a significant decrease in the number of accesses to the emergency department for AA has been recorded in different countries. A systematic review of the current literature sought to determine the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hospital admissions and complications of AA. METHOD: : A systematic search was undertaken to identify repeated cross-sectional studies reporting the management of AA during the COVID-19 pandemic (index period) as compared to the previous year, or at the turn of lockdown (reference period). Data were abstracted on article (country of origin) and patients characteristics (adults, children [i.e. non adults, <18-year-old]), or mixed population) within the two given timeframes, including demographics, number of admissions for AA, number of appendectomies, and complicated appendectomies. RESULTS: : Of 201 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 54 studies from 22 world countries were included. In total, 27 (50%) were conducted on adults, 12 (22%) on children, and 15 (28%) on a mixed patients population. The overall rate ratio of admissions for AA between the two periods was 0.94 (95%CI, 0.75-1.17), with significant differences between studies on adults (0.90 [0.74-1.09]), mixed population (0.50 [0.27-0.90]), and children (1.50 [1.01-2.22]). The overall risk ratio of complicated AA was 1.65 (1.32-2.07), ranging from 1.32 in studies on children, to 2.45 in mixed population. CONCLUSION: : The pandemic has altered the rate of admissions for AA and appendectomy, with parallel increased incidence of complicated cases in all age groups.","output":"Changes in hospital admissions and complications of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: This scoping review explores key strategies of creating inclusive dementia-friendly communities that support people with dementia and their informal caregiver.

METHODS Relevant published and internal documents were retrieved for a descriptive analysis of EUnetHTA processes, methods, and outputs related to EUnetHTA's response to the pandemic. RESULTS Process: In April 2020, a COVID-19 task force was set up and a survey collected pressing health policy questions across Europe. Two coordinating agencies for diagnostic tests and therapeutics were assigned. A process for prioritization and selection was set up for therapeutics, as well as explicit starting and stopping rules. Methodology: To increase a timely response, it was agreed that the rapid collaborative reviews (rapid CRs) would not require the consultation of manufacturers and the involvement of external experts, but would not differ in the methods and conduct of the systematic search, review, and synthesis of all available evidence, nor in the requirement for reviewing by EUnetHTA partners. Final reports: The joint effort resulted in the production of two rapid CRs on diagnostic tests, nineteen collaborative rolling reviews on therapeutics, three of which later moved to rapid CRs.

Moreover, the dearth of effectual remedies has caused an expeditious rise in the total COVID 19 cases. Though vaccines have been developed, the enormous task of vaccinating a large population is still challenging. Also, as new variants emanate, the resilience from infections conceivably decreases. Hence, it's most unlikely that we'll achieve herd immunity globally so soon. Thus, since the transmission of COVID causing coronavirus roots mainly to social proximity between people, it is necessary to stringently comply to the non pharmaceutical preventive measures of wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. Howbeit, it has evidently been found that people are being lethargically ignorant to the social distancing norms with passing time. Hence, an autonomous mechanism intended at social distancing violation detection through monitoring of people is needed to be introduced at an authority level. In this paper, the implementation of YOLO Object detection transfer learning process has been used for accomplishing this aim of real time detection of social distancing violation. Our social distance prediction approach uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 object tracking algorithm for identifying people in an input video stream. A Distance estimation algorithm is further used, that works by computing euclidean distance between the centroids of each pair of detected people. This approach highlights the people violating the social distancing criteria as well as calculates the number of times social distancing gets violated as any two people get closer than a set threshold value of minimum permissible distance. A number of experiments on various pre-recorded video streams has been conducted in order to estimate the viability of this method.

We further demonstrate that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of N protein. This enrichment of spike renders LV particles more infectious as well as less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody.

Because of the high frequency of naturally occurring mutations, the emergence of H5N1 variants with high virulence has raised great concerns about the potential transmissibility of the virus in humans. Recent studies have shown that laboratory-mutated or reassortant H5N1 viruses could be efficiently transmitted among mammals, particularly ferrets, the best animal model for humans. Thus, it is critical to establish effective strategies to combat future H5N1 pandemics. In this study, we identified a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), HA-7, that potently neutralized all tested strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1, 2.2, 2.3.4, and 2.3.2.1 and completely protected mice against lethal challenges of H5N1 viruses from clades 1 and 2.3.4. HA-7 specifically targeted the globular head of the H5N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA). Using electron microscopy technology with three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-EM), we discovered that HA-7 bound to a novel and highly conserved conformational epitope that was centered on residues 81 to 83 and 117 to 122 of HA1 (H5 numbering). We further demonstrated that HA-7 inhibited viral entry during postattachment events but not at the receptor-binding step, which is fully consistent with the 3D-EM result. Taken together, we propose that HA-7 could be humanized as an effective passive immunotherapeutic agent for antiviral stockpiling for future influenza pandemics caused by emerging unpredictable H5N1 strains.

Three mAbs, HJ16, HGN194 and HK20, were obtained from patients within the HIV-1 cohort of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM). Our aim was to generate immunization antibodies equivalent to those seen in plasma. Here, we describe the selection and characterization of patient plasma and their mAbs, using a range of neutralization assays, including several peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) based assays and replicating primary viruses as well as cell line based assays and pseudoviruses (PV). The principal criterion for selection of patient plasma was the activity in an extended incubation phase PBMC assay. Neutralizing Abs, derived from their memory B cells, were then selected by ELISA with envelope proteins as solid phase. MAbs were subsequently tested in a high-throughput HOS-PV assay to assess functional neutralization. The present study indicates that the strong profiles in the patients' plasma were not solely due to antibodies represented by the newly isolated mAbs. Although results from the various assays were divergent, they by and large indicate that neutralizing Abs to other epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope are present in the plasma and synergy between Abs may be important. Thus, the spectrum of the obtained mAbs does not cover the range of cross-reactivity seen in plasma in these carefully selected patients irrespective of which neutralization assay is used.

We analyzed a new epiphysiodesis technique using radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in a porcine model. METHODS Six 35-kg and two 25-kg immature pigs were used. 1 hind leg of each animal was randomly selected and the proximal tibia growth plate was ablated laterally and medially. The contralateral leg was used as a control. MR images were obtained immediately after the ablation and 12 weeks later for 6 animals, and 24 weeks later for the other 2 animals. CT was done for the 2 animals that were followed for 24 weeks for proof of bone bridges. RESULTS Both tibias were equal in length initially. At the 12-week follow-up, there was an average leg length discrepancy of 3.9 mm (95% CI: 3.0-4.8), and at 24 weeks the difference was 8.4 mm and 7.5 mm. No damage to the adjacent tissue was found.

The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of food banks and pantries has increased in the US. Here we examine perceptions of food banks and food pantries and their relationship to food security and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a statewide representative survey (n = 600) of residents of Vermont. The utilization of food pantries was more common among food insecure households and households with children. Among food insecure respondents, those who did not use a food pantry were significantly more likely to report consuming less FV during the pandemic. Further, we find respondents who are food insecure and using a food pantry report consuming more FV since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that respondents who were both food insecure and reported not using a food pantry were significantly more likely to report both a reduction in fruit consumption (b = ?0.58; p = 0.001) and a reduction in vegetable consumption (b = ?0.415; p = 0.012).

During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","output":"Persons with Substance Abuse Disorders and Other Addictions: Coping with the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients suffer from worse coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Whether active oncologic treatment is an additional risk factor in this population remains unclear. Therefore, here we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of active oncologic treatment on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) was conducted for studies published from inception to July 1, 2020, with a subsequent search update conducted on 10 October 2020. In addition, abstracts and presentations from major conference proceedings (ASCO, ESMO, AACR) as well as pre-print databases (medxriv, bioxriv) were searched. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes in cancer patients with laboratory confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and details of active or recent oncologic treatment were selected. Random-effects model was applied throughout meta-analyses. Summary outcome measure was the pooled odds ratio (OR) of death for active cancer therapy versus no active cancer therapy for each of the following modalities: recent surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. RESULTS: Sixteen retrospective and prospective studies (3558 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Active chemotherapy was associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23). No significant association with risk of death was identified for active targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or recent surgery. Meta-analysis of multivariate adjusted OR of death for active chemotherapy was consistently associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.01-2.01). CONCLUSIONS: Active chemotherapy appears to be associated with higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE We have screened phytocompounds from a medicinal herb, Tinospora cordifolia, for their capacities to interrupt the viral RBD and host ACE2 interactions. METHOD We employed molecular docking to screen phytocompounds in T. cordifolia against the ACE2-RBD complex, performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and estimated the electrostatic component of binding free energy. RESULTS 'Tinocordiside' docked very well at the center of the interface of ACE2-RBD complex, and was found to be well stabilized during MD simulation. Tinocordiside incorporation significantly decreased electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex (23.5 and 17.10 kcal/mol in the trajectories without or with the ligand, respectively). As the basal rate constant of protein association is in the order of 5, (105 to 106 M-1 S-1 ), there might be no big conformational change or loop reorganization, but involves only local conformational change typically observed in diffusion-controlled association. Taken together, the increase in global flexibility of the complex, clearly indicates the start of unbinding process of the complex. CONCLUSION It indicates that such an interruption of electrostatic interactions between the RBD and ACE2, and the increase in global flexibility of the complex, would weaken or block SARS-CoV-2 entry and its subsequent infectivity. We postulate that natural phytochemicals like Tinocordiside could be the viable options for controlling SARS-CoV-2 contagion and its entry into host cells.","output":"Tinocordiside from Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) May Curb SARS-CoV-2 Contagion by Disrupting the Electrostatic Interactions between Host ACE2 and Viral S-Protein Receptor Binding Domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) induces a chronic, progressive demyelinating disease in susceptible mouse strains characterized by inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates and spastic hind limb paralysis. Our lab has previously demonstrated a critical role for TMEV- and myelin-specific CD4(+) T cells in initiating and perpetuating this pathology. It has however, also been shown that the MHC class I loci are associated with susceptibility/resistance to TMEV infection and persistence. For this reason, we investigated the contribution of CD8(+) T cells to the TMEV-induced demyelinating pathology in the highly susceptible SJL/J mouse strain. Here we show that 2M-deficient SJL mice have similar disease incidence rates to wild-type controls, however 2M-deficient mice demonstrated earlier onset of clinical disease, elevated in vitro responses to TMEV and myelin proteolipid (PLP) epitopes, and significantly higher levels of CNS demyelination and macrophage infiltration at 50 days post-infection. 2M-deficient mice also displayed a significant elevation in persisting viral titers, as well as an increase in macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in the spinal cord at this same time point. Taken together, these results indicate that CD8(+) T cells are not required for clinical or histologic disease initiation or progression in TMEV-infected SJL mice. Rather, these data stress the critical role of CD4(+) T cells in this capacity and further emphasize the potential for CD8(+) T cells to contribute to protection from TMEV-induced demyelination.","output":"CD8-deficient SJL mice display enhanced susceptibility to Theilers virus infection and increased demyelinating pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has recently made the entire world come to a standstill.

Our results show that all the baculoviruses possessed a general weak trend of codon bias. The differences of ENc (effective number of codons) values, nucleotide contents and the impacts of nucleotide content on ENc value within alpha-/betabaculovirus pairs were independent of whether the host species are the same or different. Furthermore, the majority of amino acid sequences adopted codons unequally in all viruses, but the numbers of common preferred codons between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were not significantly different from the differences observed between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. In addition, the amino acids that adopt the same synonymous codon composition between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were statistically as few as those between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. Correspondence analysis revealed that no major factors resulted in the codon bias in these baculoviruses, implying multiple minor influential factors exist. Neutrality plot analysis indicated that selection pressure dominated mutations in shaping the codon usage.

Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources. METHODS: We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the weighted interval score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known. RESULTS: All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.

Mechanism of infection, protection or rapid evolution until fatal outcome of the disease remains poorly understood. To elucidate the dynamics of humoral response in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, we performed a study to investigate the time course of antibody response in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 42 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at 6 different time points (hospital admission, day 2, day 6, day 12-14, day 18-20, day 27-30) and from 25 asymptomatic subjects at 3 different time points (at the time of positive swab, 2 months, 6 months). Samples were tested by commercial ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein IgA, IgM, and IgG and nucleoprotein (NP) IgG, and by micro-neutralization assay. RESULTS: In patients, titres increased for all antibody classes including neutralizing antibody from day 6 to day 18-20 but at day 27-30 started to decline. A high correlation between S and NP antigens and among antibody classes was found. No significant difference in antibody titres at baseline and by peak antibody level was found between recovered and deceased. 64.0% of asymptomatic subjects were negative to any antibody at any time point. Asymptomatic subjects with positive antibody level had titres well below patients, and neutralizing antibodies were found only in 2 subjects (8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that COVID-19 patients produce an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 regardless the outcome. The peak is reached by 3 weeks from hospital admission followed by a sharp decrease. On the contrary, only few asymptomatic subjects develop antibodies at detectable levels, though lower compared to COVID-19 patients. Since neutralizing antibodies were rarely produced, this finding raises the question about the protection of these subjects against reinfection. KEY MESSAGES: COVID-19 patients produce an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 which does not differ between recovered and deceased. Only few asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects develop antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were rarely produced.","output":"Characterization of antibody response in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims Recruitment maneuvers may be used during anesthesia as part of perioperative protective ventilation strategy. However, the hemodynamic effect of recruitment maneuvers remain poorly documented in this setting. Material and Methods This was a prospective observational study performed in operating theatre including patients scheduled for major vascular surgery. Patients were monitored with invasive arterial pressure and esophageal doppler. After induction of general anesthesia, before surgery began, preload optimization based on stroke volume (SV) variation following fluid challenge was performed. Then, an alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) through stepwise increase in positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was performed. Hemodynamic data were noted before, during, and after the alveolar recruitment maneuver. Results ARM through stepwise increase in PEEP and CPAP were applied in 22 and 14 preload independent patients, respectively. Relative changes in SV during ARMs were significantly greater in the ARMCPAP group (-39  20%) as compared to the ARMPEEP group (-15  22%; P = 0.002). The difference (95% CI) in relative decrease in SV between ARMCPAP and ARMPEEP groups was -24% (-38 to -9; P = 0.001). Changes in arterial pressure, cardiac index, pulse pressure variation, peak velocity, and corrected flow time measures were not different between groups. Conclusion During anesthesia, in preload independent patients, ARMs through CPAP resulted in a significantly greater decrease in SV than stepwise increase in PEEP. During anesthesia, ARM should be used cautiously.","output":"Changes in stroke volume during an alveolar recruitment maneuvers through a stepwise increase in positive end expiratory pressure and transient continuous positive airway pressure in anesthetized patients.

We measure wealth, other economic (insurance, income);exposure (long-term care, employment, telework, household size);and health (chronic conditions, smoking) risk stratified by age (50-64, 65+). Results: Blacks and Hispanics face dramatically greater financial risk that potentially increases exposure to COVID-19, relative to whites;Blacks and Hispanics are four to five times more likely to have no financial wealth. Blacks are also more likely than whites to use long-term care. Blacks and Hispanics also are less likely to have health insurance and face greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 because they are less likely to telework, and Hispanic older adults reside in larger households. Black and Hispanic older adults are also more likely to have a chronic condition associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that wealth differences may play a substantial role in contributing to the very large racial and ethnic disparities in the health burden of COVID-19.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia and visceral adipose tissue in ICU patients treated for COVID-19. Material and Methods: The study designed as a retrospective cross-sectional study for evaluating the effect of prognostic radiologic features in COVID-19 infected patients. The patient characteristics, intubation status and dates, transfer to ICU, and last control or death dates were recorded. Axial CT images, including all abdominal muscles, total skeletal muscle area, were calculated. The total and psoas sarcopenia index (PSI) was calculated by dividing the square of the patients height by the square meter (cm2/m2). Also, axial CT images of the body fat subcutaneous adipose and visceral adipose tissue distribution areas were calculated in cm2 using threshold values of-30 to-190 for adipose tissue. Results: In the study population, there were nine deaths that occurred among male patients. In univariate analysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and PSI were found to be related to prognosis. The median survival was 14 days in PSI low group. The prognostic effect of the PSI was still valid in the male population. Other factors had no relationship with survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, the prognostic effect of TSI and PSI was related to prognosis, while COPD lost its prognostic effect. Discussion: In this study, we found a new prognostic factor in critically ill COVID-19 patients, which may be a new area of interest. In contrast to other studies, we found no effect of BMI and visceral adipose tissue on mortality in COVID-19 patients treated in ICU.

Alveolar haemorrhage, for example following primary blast lung injury (PBLI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), results in the escape of erythrocytes (RBCs) into alveolar spaces, where they subsequently lyse and release their intracellular contents. However, the inflammatory effects of RBCs in the airways are not fully understood. We hypothesized that RBCs in the airway induce an inflammatory response, associated with platelet activation. By instilling whole RBCs or lysed RBCs into the airways of mice, we have demonstrated that whole RBCs elicit macrophage accumulation in the lung. However, lysed RBCs induce significant inflammatory cell recruitment, particularly neutrophils and this was associated with a 50% increase in circulating platelet neutrophil complexes (PNCs). Platelet depletion prior to lysed RBC exposure in the lung resulted in reduced neutrophil recruitment, suggesting that the presence of intracellular RBC components in the airways can elicit inflammation that is platelet dependent. To identify specific platelet dependent signalling pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment, anti-P-selectin ligand and anti-PSGL1 blocking antibodies were tested, however neither affected neutrophil recruitment. These findings implicate an involvement for other, as yet unidentified platelet-dependent signalling and adhesion mechanisms. Further understanding of how platelets contribute to lung inflammation induced by the presence of RBCs could offer novel therapeutic approaches to attenuate inflammation that occurs in conditions associated with alveolar haemorrhage.","output":"Red Blood Cells Elicit Platelet-Dependent Neutrophil Recruitment into Lung Airspaces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first report of molecular and epidemiology findings from Bosnia and Herzegovina related to ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

However, the intriguingly high 28-day mortality rate of patients that did not complete the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide, compared non-completers of the placebo arm and overall placebo arm, raised the hypotheses of the existence of non-neglectable differences between ITT and on-treatment (OT) analysis in terms of drug efficacy. Despite the inherent limitations of OT analysis, we aimed to respond to unanswered questions regarding the drug efficacy when the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide was complete, and secondarily understand the causality relationship between treatment interruption and mortality rate. Methods: This is a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicentric, two-arm RCT of 300mg-daily 14-day proxalutamide therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, using OT population, i.e., excluding patients that did not complete treatment or interrupted at least 24 hours before death. Patients above 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19 not presenting kidney, liver, or heart failure were eligible. The primary outcome was 8-point COVD-19 ordinal scale at day 14. Secondary outcomes included 28-day 8-point COVID-19 ordinary scale, 14-day and 28-day all-cause mortality rate, and median hospital length. Results: In total, 580 patients completed the 14-day treatment or died during treatment, including 288 patients in the proxalutamide arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm, with similar baseline characteristics between groups. The 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 4.2% in the proxalutamide group and 49.0% in the placebo group. The mortality risk ratio (RR) was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.15), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.2 to prevent death. The median hospital length stay after randomization was 05 days (interquartile range - IQR = 3 to 7.2 days) in the proxalutamide group and 09 days (IQR = 6 to 15 days) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate of patients that received proxalutamide but interrupted treatment before 14 days was 79.3%, while those that received placebo and interrupted before 14 days was 52.8% (p = 0.054 between groups).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has influenced all the dimensions of human lives and the functional pattern of the health care systems in the whole world. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Croatian blood collection system and to evaluate the main factors that influence voluntary blood donation practice in blood donors (BDs). METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted in convenient sample of voluntary BDs from Split-Dalmatia County during the May 2020 to December 2020. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 479 regular BDs, 88.5% males and 11.5% females, mean age 39.810.8 years. Majority of them had high school education and living with the partner (67.4% and 74.5%, respectively). During COVID-19 pandemic 71.0% of them continued with regular donations while 29% of them postponed their donation. According to the BDs knowledge regarding COVID-19 infection there were 88.9% of those with unsatisfactory and only 11.1% of those with satisfactory knowledge regarding this infection. The study revealed that females, BDs living alone and younger BDs (aged 18 to 43 years) had more frequently postponed blood donation during COVID-19 pandemic (P < 0.0001, P = 0.004 and P = 0.017, respectively). The study further showed that there was no correlation between BDs knowledge about COVID-19 infection and their blood donation practice during ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Croatian blood collection system via reduction in the practice of voluntary blood donations. Sociodemographic characteristics of BDs were the main factors that influence Croatian BDs voluntary blood donation practice during pandemic while their knowledge about COVID-19 infection was not correlated with their behaviour. KEY MESSAGES: The sustainability of the health care system during a pandemic depends significantly on the blood supply, which is why it is necessary to ensure that blood collection system is continually maintained. The knowledge of blood donors about COVID-19 infection needs to be improved in order to prevent spreading of the infection generally and especially within this highly important population subgroup.","output":"Croatian blood collection system amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a cat with chronic, progressive, non-painful, non-lateralizing multifocal neurologic clinical signs associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

In fact, research has outlined that urban areas depend on global supply chains for their day-to-day basic functions, including energy supplies, food and safe access to potable water. The disruption of global supply chains can leave many urban areas in a very vulnerable position, in which their citizens may struggle to obtain their basic supplies, as the COVID-19 crisis has recently shown. Therefore, solutions aiming to enhance local food, water and energy production systems, even in urban environments, have to be pursued. The COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted in the scientific community the problem of peoples exposure to outdoor and indoor pollution, confirmed as a key element for the increase both in the transmission and severity of the contagion, on top of involving health risks on their own. In this context, most nations are going to adopt new preferential policies to stimulate the development of relevant sustainable energy industries, based on the electrification of the systems supplied by renewable energy sources as confirmed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Thus, while there is ongoing research focusing on a COVID 19 vaccine, there is also a need for researchers to work cooperatively on novel strategies for world economic recovery incorporating renewable energy policy, technology and management. In this framework, the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) conference provides a good platform for researchers and other experts to exchange their academic thoughts, promoting the development and improvements on the renewable energy technologies as well as their role in systems and in the transition towards sustainable energy systems. The 14th SDEWES Conference was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It brought together around 570 researchers from 55 countries in the field of sustainable development.

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","output":"Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment/ Ensayos clnicos de reposicionamiento de medicamentos para el tratamiento de la COVID-19/ Ensaios clnicos de reposicionamento de medicamentos para o tratamento do COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In early 2020, many services modified their delivery of opioid treatment in response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, to limit viral spread and maintain treatment continuity.

METHODS: A pre\\\\post comparison of treatment conditions and patient self\\\\reported outcomes using data extracted from electronic medical records in the 5 months before (December 2019CApril 2020) and after (May 2020CSeptember 2020) changes were implemented in three public treatment services in South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. RESULTS: Data are available for 429/460 (93%) patients. Few (21, 5%) dropped out of treatment. In the post period there was significantly more use of depot buprenorphine (12C24%), access to any take\\\\away doses (TAD; 24C69%), access to 6 TAD per week (7C31%), pharmacy dosing (24C52%) and telehealth services. There were significant reductions in average opioid and benzodiazepine use, increases in cannabis use, with limited group changes in social conditions, or quality of life, psychological and physical health. At an individual level, 22% of patients reported increases in their use of either alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or stimulants of 4 days in the past 4 weeks. Regression analysis indicates increases in substance use were associated with higher levels of supervised dosing. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that the modified model of care continued to provide safe and effective treatment, during the pandemic. Notably, there was no association between more TAD and significant increases in substance use.

The Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 assay, which simultaneously detects two viral targets, the orf1ab and S genes, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 were highly sensitive and detected as low as 15 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction. In addition, the two assays were specific and showed no cross-reactivity with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and other common human respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. Also, both assays were highly reproducible across different operators and instruments. When used to test animal samples, both assays equally detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in the swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. The M1 lysis buffer completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 10 min at room temperature enabling safe handling of clinical samples.

Guidelines to protect patients and staff emerged and changed rapidly based on expert opinion and limited evidence. This paper presents the experiences and innovations developed by international surgical teams during the early stages of the pandemic to attempt to mitigate risk. DESIGN: In-depth, semistructured interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically using methods of constant comparison. PARTICIPANTS: 43 participants, including surgeons from a range of specialties (primarily general surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, cardiothoracic and ophthalmology), anaesthetists and those in nursing roles. SETTING: The UK, Italy, Spain, the USA, China and New Zealand between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Surgical teams sought to mitigate COVID-19 risks by modifying their current practice with an abundance of strategies and innovations. Communication and teamwork played an integral role in how teams adapted, although participants reflected on the challenges of having to improvise in real time. Uncertainties remained about optimal surgical practice and there were significant tensions where teams were forced to balance what was best for patients while contemplating their own safety. CONCLUSIONS: The perceptions of risks during a pandemic such as COVID-19 can be complex and context dependent. Management of these risks in surgery must be driven by evidence\\\\based practice resulting from a pragmatic and novel approach to collation of global evidence. The context of surgery has changed dramatically, and surgical teams have developed a plethora of innovations.

The following categories are reported: indices of increased accumulation of body fat; weight indices and mortality; weight indices and risk of disease; normal weight obesity and normal weight abdominal obesity; metabolically healthy obesity; the obesity paradox. It appears that BMI is still the most common measure for determining weight categories, followed by measures of abdominal fat distribution. Newer measures, unlike BMI, take fat distribution into account but often lack validated cut-off values or have limited applicability. Given the high prevalence of obesity and the associated risk of disease and mortality, it is important for a targeted approach to identify risk groups and determine individual risk. Therefore, in addition to BMI, a measure of fat distribution should always be used to ensure that less obvious but risky manifestations such as normal weight obesity are identified.","output":"The Weight Problem: Overview of the Most Common Concepts for Body Mass and Fat Distribution and Critical Consideration of Their Usefulness for Risk Assessment and Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Globally, poultry production provides high-quality, affordable animal protein, a high chance for investment, job opportunities, and a source of income for smallholders worldwide. However, the recent COVID-19 affected the sustainability of various animal production sectors worldwide, and these influences are more severe in developing countries. The unprecedented negative influences are attributed to the lockdown, movement restriction, and close of some markets. The present review focuses on the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on poultry production in developing countries in terms of causes and possible solutions to decrease and improve profits. Work must be coordinated between the public and private sectors to facilitate the restoration of the poultry industry to its economic and social position to remedy these problems. ABSTRACT: Poultry farming is a significant source of revenue generation for small farmers in developing countries. It plays a vital role in fulfilling the daily protein requirements of humans through meat and eggs consumption. The recently emerged pandemic Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) impacts the poultry production sector. Although the whole world is affected, these impacts may be more severe in developing countries due to their dependency on exporting necessary supplies such as feed, vaccines, drugs, and utensils. In this review, we have discussed poultry production in developing countries under the COVID-19 crisis and measures to regain the loss in the poultry industries. Generally, due to the lockdown, trade limitations have negatively impacted poultry industries, which might exacerbate global poverty. Coordinated activities have to be taken at the private and government levels to arrange soft loans so that these farms can restore their production and marketing to normal levels. In addition, here, we have focused on the supply of farm input, feed, other raw materials, management system, improved breeding efficiency, veterinary services, and marketing of egg and meat, which have to be ensured to secure a sustainable poultry production chain.","output":"Poultry Production and Sustainability in Developing Countries under the COVID-19 Crisis: Lessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined from a gender-sensitive perspective the associations of exclusion from social relations (ESR) with the quality of life (QoL) of excluded older persons. Being satisfied with existing relations (i.e., network satisfaction) may be particularly important for the QoL of older persons with small networks, whereas the QoL of network-less older persons may be associated with their perception of solitude (i.e., solitude satisfaction). This study examined the moderating role of network satisfaction (NS) in the gendered associations between network size and QoL, as well as the gendered associations of solitude satisfaction (SS) with the QoL of older network-less persons. In addition, the comparative disadvantages in the QoL of network-less older persons with low-to-high SS, compared to the QoL of socially embedded persons with low-to-high NS were examined. Cross-sectional gender stratified secondary analyses of data from participants (N = 72.433) in the Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) did not provide convincing evidence that a higher NS is particularly important for the QoL of older persons with smaller networks. Among older network-less persons, lower SS was associated with lower QoL, comparatively more so among older women. Older persons embedded in a social network with low NS, as well as older network-less persons with low SS, have comparatively the lowest levels of QoL. It was concluded that the subjective evaluation of social relations and the subjective evaluation of solitude are associated with gendered disadvantages in the QoL of older persons challenged by ESR.","output":"Network and solitude satisfaction as modifiers of disadvantages in the quality of life of older persons who are challenged by exclusion from social relations: a gender stratified analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the incidence of lower limb lymphedema (LLL) after surgery for endometrial cancer (EC) by means of three methods, and to determine the incidence of lymphocysts after one year. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in 14 hospitals in Sweden. Two-hundred-and-thirty-five women with EC were included; 116 underwent surgery that included lymphadenectomy (+LA) and 119 were without lymphadenectomy (-LA). Lymphedema was assessed objectively on four occasions; preoperatively, at 4-6 weeks, six months and one year postoperatively using systematic measurement of leg circumferences, enabling calculation of leg volumes, and a clinical grading of LLL, and subjectively by the patient's perception of lymphedema measured by a lymphedema-specific quality-of-life instrument. Lymphocyst was evaluated by vaginal ultrasonography. RESULTS: After one year the incidence of LLL after increase in leg volume adjusted for body mass index was 15.8% in +LA women and 3.4% in -LA women. The corresponding figures for clinical grading were 24.1% and 11.8%, and for patient-reported perceived LLL 10.7% and 5.1%. The agreement between the modalities revealed fair to moderate correlation between patient-reported LLL and clinical grading, but poor agreement between volume increase and patient-reported LLL or clinical grading. Lymphocysts were found in 4.3% after one year. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of LLL and lymphocysts after surgery for EC including LA seemed to be relatively high the study demonstrated significant variations in incidence depending on the measurement modality. This emphasizes the need for a 'gold standard' of measurement of LLL in clinical practice and research.","output":"Incidence of lymphedema in the lower limbs and lymphocyst formation within one year of surgery for endometrial cancer: A prospective longitudinal multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuous cell lines have become indispensable tools that have enabled investigations into cellular mechanisms by increasing experimental reproducibility and sample availability, and decreasing the use of experimental animals. To facilitate studies of epithelial barrier function of the porcine colon, we aimed to establish an epithelial cell line with an extended replicative capacity. Cells were isolated from the proximal colon of a 3-week-old piglet and transduced using a recombinant retroviral vector construct containing the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAg). We established a clonal epithelial cell line, referred to as PoCo83-3, that stably expressed the SV40 TAg, verified at mRNA and protein levels. PoCo83-3 showed epithelial cell-specific features, such as cobblestone-like morphology, dome structure formation, the presence of apical microvilli, and the expression of keratin 18, E-cadherin and the tight junction-associated proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1. To validate PoCo83-3 as an in vitro model in epithelial barrier research, proinflammatory cytokine-inducible alterations in barrier integrity were demonstrated by incubating the cells with TNF- and IFN- for 48 h. These cytokine treatments promoted a decreased transepithelial electrical resistance. In summary, PoCo83-3 exhibited an extended life span and a differentiated phenotype while maintaining epithelial characteristics. Based on these results, we present this cell line as a valuable in vitro model for investigations of epithelial barrier function in the porcine colon.","output":"Establishment and Characterization of an SV40 Large T Antigen-Transduced Porcine Colonic Epithelial Cell Line."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Populations around the world are facing an increasing burden of firearm violence on mortality and disability.

Indeed, a recent study on over 2100 female physicians who met the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder revealed that 50% were reluctant to seek professional help due to fear of exposure to stigma. Left untreated or undertreated, mental health problems in doctors can result in impairment of occupational functioning, compromise patient safety and place considerable strain on the economy (by increasing the amount of sick leave taken). Moreover, the consequences of mental health stigma in the medical profession can be fatal. Dr Daksha Emson, a psychiatrist with bipolar affective disorder, tragically killed herself and her baby daughter during a psychotic episode. An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that she was the victim of stigma in the National Health Service. The mental health of medical students and doctors, in all of its aspects, must therefore be addressed with the urgency that it demands.

This article investigates individual-level differences in mass support for the restriction of civil liberties during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing theories of affect and decision-making, it assesses the extent to which different emotional reactions toward the pandemic influenced attitudes toward mobile phone surveillance and the implementation of curfews. We test our hypotheses in five advanced European democracies using panel data which allow us to identify the role of emotions in support for restrictive policies controlling for individual heterogeneity. The results suggest that experiencing fear about Covid-19 had a strong positive impact on supporting these measures, while hope and anger only played a minimal role. Importantly, the findings indicate that emotions moderate the impact of trust toward the government, a key variable for supporting the restriction of civil liberties during the pandemic. Specifically, experiencing fear was associated with higher acceptance of civil liberty restrictions. Further, experiencing fear substantially decreased the effect of trust in the government, rendering those who lack trust toward the government more supportive of civil liberty restrictions. These findings help us understand the psychological mechanisms that leads citizens to swiftly decide to sacrifice their civil liberties in the light of threat. Further, they offer empirical support for the causal role of affect in political decision-making. This article is protected by copyright.

The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4(th), March, 2020, until 7am 6(th), March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96).

As a consequence, family caregivers, friends, and volunteers were not allowed to enter nursing homes, while residents were not allowed to go out. Up until now, little is known on the long-term consequences and effects of visiting bans and re-opening of nursing homes. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term effects of the pandemic on residents, family members, and staff, and their preparedness for the next coronavirus wave. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used, consisting of a questionnaire and analyses of documentation (local visiting protocols). Of the 76 nursing home locations that participated in a Dutch national pilot on welcoming visitors back into nursing homes, 64 participated in this follow-up study. Data were collected in September/October 2020. For each nursing home, one contact person completed the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative questionnaire data. Data on open-ended questions, as well as data from the documentation, were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that the consequences of strict visiting bans do not disappear at the moment the visiting ban is lifted. Although in October 2020, daily life in nursing homes was more back to normal, more than one-third of the respondents indicated that they still applied restrictions. Compared to the situation before the pandemic, fewer volunteers were working in the nursing homes, grandchildren visited their relative less often, and visits differed. CONCLUSIONS: Five months after the visiting ban in Dutch nursing homes had been lifted, it still had an impact on residents, family members, and staff. It is questionable whether nursing homes feel prepared for welcoming visitors in the case of new COVID-19 infections. Nursing homes indicated that they felt prepared for the next wave, while at the same time, they were particularly concerned about staff well-being and vitality. It seems wise to invest in staff well-being. In addition, it seems desirable to think about how to support nursing homes in seeking a balance between infection prevention and well-being of residents, family members, and staff.","output":"From wave to wave: a Dutch national study on the long-term impact of COVID-19 on well-being and family visitation in nursing homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) pandemic is a great threat to human society and now is still spreading.

But there has been several fake information being spread during this pandemic creating panic among the public and no system to authenticate the information. The lack of transparency of information along with the difficulty of accurate tracking of goods movements within the supply chain needs a robust traceability system. So, for efficient planning of operational processes and resource arrangements, we need to adhere to innovative technologies like blockchain.

Our secondary aim was to highlight research gaps in this rapidly evolving field. METHODS Our PROSPERO registered (CRD42019151946) systematic search of Embase, Medline and Cochrane Review Database was performed for original research articles pertaining to adult urology telehealth or virtual clinic strategies. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment performed according to Cochrane 2.0 RoB or Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for non-randomised studies. RESULTS 5,813 participants met inclusion from 18 original articles (2 randomised controlled trials; 10 prospective; 6 retrospective). Urology sub-specialities: Uro-oncology (n=6), General urology (n=8), Endo-urology (n=2), and Lower urinary tract symptoms and/or incontinence (n=2). Across all sub-specialties, prospective studies utilising VC reported: primary median VC discharge rate of 16.6% (IQR 14.7%-29.8%) and primary median face-to-face (FTF) clinic referral rate of 32.4% (IQR 15.5%-53.3%). Further, direct cost analysis demonstrated a median annual cost-savings of 56,232 (IQR 46,260-61,116).

Material and methods: In a cross-sectional online survey 687 parents of underaged children in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial predictors for IPV and associations with mental health problems of children before and during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed.

METHODS: Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate in vitro, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells.

Distribution of positive rates in different sites by genders, ages, or occupations were compared. The positive rates of different sites from high to low were: hospital wards (24.71%) > fever clinics (16.57%) > nursing homes (5.51%) > isolation hotels (5.30%) > rehabilitation stations (1.36%) >close contact sites (0.17%). The confirmed patients in isolation hotels, hospital ward, and fever clinical were mainly middle\\\\aged and elderly, and most of them were women. The positive rate in isolation hotels and fever clinics gradually decreased over time. There were no significant differences between genders among those six nucleic acid collection sites (P < .05). The hospital wards have the highest positive rate; however, close contact sites have lowest one. Patients who are discharged from hospitals may still have potential risks. Middle\\\\aged and older people remain the focus of epidemic prevention and control.","output":"Analysis of the positive rate of 4254 cases of COVID\\\\19 nucleic acid tests in different aites in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Speech understanding in noise is poorer in bilateral cochlear-implant (BICI) users compared to normal-hearing counterparts. Independent automatic gain controls (AGCs) may contribute to this because adjusting processor gain independently can reduce interaural level differences that BICI listeners rely on for bilateral benefits. Bilaterally linked AGCs may improve bilateral benefits by increasing the magnitude of interaural level differences. The effects of linked AGCs on bilateral benefits (summation, head shadow, and squelch) were measured in nine BICI users. Speech understanding for a target talker at 0 masked by a single talker at 0, 90, or ?90 azimuth was assessed under headphones with sentences at five target-to-masker ratios. Research processors were used to manipulate AGC type (independent or linked) and test ear (left, right, or both). Sentence recall was measured in quiet to quantify individual interaural asymmetry in functional performance. The results showed that AGC type did not significantly change performance or bilateral benefits. Interaural functional asymmetries, however, interacted with ear such that greater summation and squelch benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry, and interacted with interferer location such that smaller head shadow benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry. The larger benefits for those with larger asymmetry were driven by improvements from adding a better-performing ear, rather than a true binaural-hearing benefit. In summary, linked AGCs did not significantly change bilateral benefits in cases of speech-on-speech masking with a single-talker masker, but there was also no strong detriment across a range of target-to-masker ratios, within a small and diverse BICI listener population.","output":"Head Shadow, Summation, and Squelch in Bilateral Cochlear-Implant Users With Linked Automatic Gain Controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing this paper, there are over 11 million reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide.

AIM: To describe COVID-19 containment in a nursing home transformed into a caring center. METHODS: Physicians and nurses were recruited. The facility was reorganized and connected with the laboratory of the reference hospital. Ultrasound was used to diagnose pneumonia. Patients needing intensive care were transferred to the reference hospital. Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin/enoxaparin were used initially, while amiodarone/enoxaparin were used at a later phase. Under both regimens, methylprednisolone was added for severe cases. Prophylaxis was done with hydroxychloroquine initially and then with amiodarone. Period covered: March 22CJuly 31, 2020. RESULTS: The facility was reorganized in two days. Ninety-two guests of the 121 (76%) and 25 personnel of 118 (21.1%) became swab test positive. Seven swab test negative patients who developed symptoms were considered to have COVID-19. Twenty-seven patients died, 23 swab test positive, 5 of whom after full recovery. Four patients needing intensive care were transferred (3 died). Mortality, peaking in April 2020, was correlated with symptoms, comorbidities, dyspnea, fatigue, stupor/coma, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, pro-calcitonin, and high oxygen need (p  0.001 for all). Among swab-positive staff, 3 had pneumonia and recovered. Although no comparison could be made between different treatment and prophylaxis strategies, potentially useful suggestions emerged. Mortality compared well with that of nursing homes of the same area not transformed into care centers.

The viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus or COVID-19 (CoV-19) is known as a pandemic. After SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)Crelated CoV, COVID-19 is the third most pathogenic virus, hazardous to humans which have raised worries concerning the capacity of current security measures and the human services framework to deal with such danger. RECENT FINDINGS: According to WHO, the mortality rate of COVID-19 exceeded that of SARS and MERS in view of which COVID-19 was declared as public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with single stranded RNA and non-segmented envelopes. Recently, genome sequencing confirmed that COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, but the major source of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission, and mechanisms related to its pathogenicity to humans are not yet known.

This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until June, using time series ARIMA model. In further analysis, based on predicted active cases, we estimated the requirement of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients until June. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of June month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in India from March 14, 2020, to May 3 2020. We estimated requirement of ICU beds as 10%, Ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases predicted from our calculations. Results: We expect that India will be having 441896 confirmed cases (95% CI: 210240, 673552), 124712 active cases (95% CI: 68481, 180944) at the end of June based on our forecasts. Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of June while Kerala is expected to have less than 1000 confirmed cases and no active cases at the end of June. We expect that India has to prepare 106006 isolation beds (95% CI: 58209, 153802), 12471 ICU beds (95% CI: 6848,18094) and 6236 ventilators (95% CI: 3424,9047) to accommodate the patients at the end of June. Discussion and Conclusion: Our forecasts show a very alarming situation for India in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases as India is observing partial lockdown currently. In future, lockdown might be lifted, and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system.","output":"COVID 19: Real-time Forecasts of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases, and Health Infrastructure Requirements for India and its Majorly Affected States using the ARIMA model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung inflammation is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Healthy adults (age 18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60 years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses for three consecutive manufacturing lots. Findings: Between November 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198).

Before herd immunity, controlling at-risk and vulnerable groups in combination with vaccination plans is strongly recommended. The construction industry is especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of COVID-19 as illustrated by frequent relevant clusters globally and given the manual labor performed by construction workers in close physical proximity, which increases the likelihood of exposure. To gain insights into the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to inform the establishment of effective and targeted NPIs in the construction industry, a dual-community model was developed that includes the susceptible-exposed-infectious/asymptomatic-hospitalized-recovered-pathogen (SEI/AHR-P) model for construction workers and the susceptible-exposed-infectious/asymptomatic-hospitalized-recovered (SEI/AHR) model for their close contacts. The results of our sensitivity analysis corroborate previous findings that close contacts are significant participants in the spread of the infection. However, the contributions of indirect transmission pathways at a construction site were found to be weak, suggesting the need for further study given conflicting results in other research. Based on the parameters identified as significant in the sensitivity analyses, 28 NPI scenarios were devised to analyze the total attack rate (TAR) and duration of an outbreak (DO). The scenario in which exposed individuals are controlled in terms of close contacts performs best, reducing the TAR with 25% absolute efficiency (AE) and decreasing the DO in the whole population by 1.8 days. In addition to NPIs, both construction workers and their close contacts are suggested to get vaccinated. Vaccination of all construction workers would lead to a lower TAR compared to vaccination of only 15% of both construction workers and their close contacts.

Goals of the present study are to: (1) investigate whether early progressive supranuclear palsy is associated with changes in energy expenditure, body composition and dietary intake compared with Parkinsons disease and healthy controls; (2) assess the accuracy of the HarrisCBenedict equation to predict measured rest energy expenditure in progressive supranuclear palsy; (3) verify differences according to sex, phenotypes, disease severity and presence of dysphagia in progressive supranuclear palsy. METHODS: Twenty-one progressive supranuclear palsy, 41 Parkinsons disease and nine healthy controls were included. Rest energy expenditure was assessed with indirect calorimeter, body composition with bio-impedance analysis and physical activity and dietary intake were estimated with a validated frequency questionnaire. Parametric testing was used to analyze differences between groups. RESULTS: Progressive supranuclear palsy showed reduced total daily energy expenditure and physical activity compared to both other cohorts (p < 0.001) and a tendency toward lower fat-free mass compared to Parkinsons disease (p > 0.05). Limited accuracy was shown for the HarrisCBenedict equation (accurate prediction frequency < 60%). Greater disease severity was associated with lower rest energy expenditure (p = 0.030), fat-free mass (p = 0.026) and muscle mass (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Greater disease severity is associated with reduction in rest energy expenditure likely due to the reduction in lean mass and muscle mass. Such data may pave the way to clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of muscle-targeted nutritional support and physical therapy in preserving muscle mass and improving motor performances in progressive supranuclear palsy at early stages.

The production of many triggers and mediators of inflammation, which are inducers of pro-inflammatory factors, is controlled by numerous differentiation programs, through which inflammation is resolved and tissue homeostasis is restored. However, prolonged inflammatory responses or dysregulation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms can lead to chronic inflammation. Modern advances in biotechnology have made it possible to characterize the anti-inflammatory activity of phlorotannins, polyphenolic compounds from brown seaweed, and the mechanisms by which they modulate the inflammatory response. The purpose of this review is to analyze and summarize the results of numerous experimental in vitro and in vivo studies, illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of these compounds, which have a wide range of biological effects on the body. The results of these studies and the need for further research are discussed.","output":"Molecular Targets of Brown Algae Phlorotannins for the Therapy of Inflammatory Processes of Various Origins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucormycosis is a deadly fungal disease mainly caused by Rhizopus oryzae (strain 99-880), also known as Rhizopus delemar. Previously, mucormycosis occurs in immunocompromised patients of diabetes mellitus, cancer, organ transplant, etc. But there was a drastic increase in mucormycosis cases in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite several available therapies and antifungal treatments, the mortality rate of mucormycosis is about more than 50%. Currently, there is no vaccine available in the market for mucormycosis that urgently needs to develop a potential vaccine against mucormycosis with high efficacy. In the present study, we have screened 4 genome-derived predicted antigens (GDPA) through sequential filtration of the whole proteome of R. delemar using different benchmarked bioinformatics tools. These 4 GDPA along with 4 randomly selected experimentally reported antigens (ERA) were sourced for prediction of B- and T- cell epitopes and utilized in designing of two potential multi-epitope vaccine candidates which can induce both innate and adaptive immunity against R. delemar. Besides these, comparative immune simulation studies and in silico cloning were performed using L. lactis as an expression system for their possible uses as oral vaccines. This is the first multi-epitope vaccine designed against R. delemar through systematic pipelined reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic approaches. Although the wet-lab based experimental validation of designed vaccines is required before testing in the preclinical model, the current study will significantly help in reducing the cost of experimentation as well as improving the efficacy of vaccine therapy against mucormycosis and other pathogenic diseases.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A 9-month-old male patient on a home-type ventilator was referred for hypophosphatemia. He was born with a weight of 3800 g to non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal ultrasound had demonstrated nasal bone agenesis. A large anterior fontanel, frontal bossing, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose, high arched palate, low set ears, triangular mouth, and corneal opacification were detected on physical examination. Serial skeletal X-rays revealed diffuse osteosclerosis at birth which was gradually decreased by the age of 5 months with subperiosteal undermineralized bone formation and medullary space of long bone could be distinguishable with bone-within-a-bone appearance. At 9 months of age, hand X-ray revealed cupping of the ulna with loose radial bone margin with minimal fraying and osteopenia. Cranial computed tomography scan showed bilateral periventricular calcification and hydrocephalus in progress. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological examinations were consistent with RS.

A mutant cell line was isolated that selectively and quantitatively routes wild-type and various mutant PrPs for ER retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. Biochemical analyses of the mutant cells revealed that a defect in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis leads to an unprocessed GPI-anchoring signal sequence that directs both ER retention and efficient retrotranslocation of PrP. An unprocessed GPI signal was sufficient to impart ER retention, but not retrotranslocation, to a heterologous protein, revealing an unexpected role for the mature domain in the metabolism of misprocessed GPI-anchored proteins. Our results provide new insights into the quality control pathways for unprocessed GPI-anchored proteins and identify transamidation of the GPI signal sequence as a step in PrP biosynthesis that is absolutely required for its surface expression.

METHODS: Demographic, clinical and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 patients with severe COVID-19 infection (115 survivors and 68 non-survivors from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan) were used to develop the predictive models. Machine learning approaches were used to select the features and predict the patients outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models performance. A total of 64 with severe COVID-19 infection from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, were used to externally validate the final predictive model. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and non-survivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the external validation sets were 0.881. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff.

The curves predicted by these methods typically follow a Gaussian distribution with a decay rate of infections similar to the climbing rate before the peak. However, as seen from the recent COVID-19 data from the US and European countries, the decay in the number of infections is much slower than their increase before the peak. Therefore, the estimates of the final epidemic size from these models are often underpredicted. In this work, we propose two data-driven models to improve the forecasts of the epidemic during its decay. These two models use Gaussian and piecewise-linear fits of the infection rate respectively during the deceleration phase, if available, to project the future course of the pandemic. For countries, which are not yet in the decline phase, these models use the peak predicted by epidemiological models but correct the infection rate to incorporate a realistic slow decline based on the trends from the recent data.

The objective of this study was to examine the survival effect of delay in starting concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study querying the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2016. Women with stage IB2-IVA squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix who received definitive CCRT with known wait-time for CCRT initiation after cancer diagnosis were eligible (N=13,617). Cox proportional hazard regression model with restricted cubic spline transformation was fitted to assess the association between CCRT wait-time and all-cause mortality in multivariable analysis. RESULTS The median wait-time to start CCRT was 6 (IQR 4-8) weeks. In a multivariable analysis, older age, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic ethnicity, recent year of diagnosis, Medicaid and uninsured status, medical comorbidities, and absence of nodal metastasis were associated with longer CCRT wait-time (P<.05). Women with aggressive tumor factors (poorer differentiation, large tumor size, nodal metastasis, and higher cancer stage) were more likely to have a short CCRT wait-time (P<.05). After controlling for the measured covariates, CCRT wait-time of 6.1-9.8 weeks was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to a wait-time of 6 weeks. Similar association was observed when the cohort was stratified by histology, cancer stage, tumor size, or brachytherapy use. CONCLUSION An implication of this study for the current coronavirus pandemic is that in the absence of aggressive tumor factors, a short period of wait-time to start definitive CCRT may not be associated with increased risk of mortality in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer.","output":"Association between definitive chemoradiotherapy wait-time and survival in locally-advanced cervical cancer: Implications during the coronavirus pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complete sequence of the spike (S) gene of the Br1/87 isolate of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) was determined from cDNA clones.

A solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was found in four patients, and a pancreatic endocrine tumor was found in one patient. The tumor was relatively small (median size, 1.5 cm; range, 1-2 cm). All remnant pancreases were managed using pancreaticogastrostomy. The median operation time was 480 min (range 360-480 min), and the median estimated intraoperative bleeding was 200 ml (range 100-600 ml). No transfusion was given during the perioperative period. The median hospital stay was 12 days (range 9-28 days). Only one patient experienced postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B), which was managed using the percutaneous drainage procedure. No operative morality was noted. In a comparative analysis with open CP, the robotic CP group demonstrated a smaller asymptomatic (17 out of 10 patients vs none, p = 0.026) tumor (5.9  6.4 vs 1.4  0.4 cm; p = 0.055), a longer operation time (286.5  90.2 vs 432.0  65.7 min, p = 0.013), and less intraoperative bleeding (432.0  65.7 vs 286.5  90.2 ml, p = 0.013).

Our findings demonstrate the potential of TLR agonist-siRNA conjugates for targeted gene silencing coupled with TLR stimulation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.","output":"TLR agonistCStat3 siRNA conjugates: cell-specific gene silencing and enhanced antitumor immune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare placebo (PBO) and 7 therapeutic regimensnamely, bronchodilator agents (BAs), hypertonic saline (HS), BA  HS, corticosteroids (CS), epinephrine (EP), EP  CS, and EP  HSto determine the optimal bronchiolitis treatment. METHODS: We plotted networks using the curative outcome of several studies and specified the relations among the experiments by using mean difference, standardized mean difference, and corresponding 95% credible interval. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to separately rank each therapy on clinical severity score (CSS) and length of hospital stay (LHS).

All 7 therapeutic regimens displayed no significant difference to PBO with regard to CSS in our study. Among the 7 therapies, BA performed better than CS. As for LHS, EP and EP  HS had an advantage over PBO. Moreover, EP and EP  HS were also more efficient than BA. The SUCRA results showed that EP  CS is most effective, and EP  HS is second most effective with regard to CSS. With regard to LHS, EP  HS ranked first, EP  CS ranked second, and EP ranked third.

We have utilized deep sequencing to determine adenosine to guanine (AG) mutations, signifying ADAR activity, in clinical samples retrieved from 93 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)Cinfected patients in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. AG mutations were detected in 0.035% (median) of RNA residues and were predominantly nonsynonymous. These mutations were rarely detected in the major viral population but were abundant in minor viral populations in which AG was more prevalent than any other mutation (P < 0.001). The AG substitutions accumulated in the spike protein gene at positions corresponding to amino acids 505 to 510 in the receptor binding motif and at amino acids 650 to 655. The frequency of AG mutations in minor viral populations was significantly associated with low viral load (P < 0.001). We additionally analyzed AG mutations in 288,247 SARS-CoV-2 major (consensus) sequences representing the dominant viral population. The AG mutations observed in minor viral populations in the initial patient cohort were increasingly detected in European consensus sequences between March and June 2020 (P < 0.001) followed by a decline of these mutations in autumn and early winter (P < 0.001). We propose that ADAR-induced deamination of RNA is a significant source of mutated SARS-CoV-2 and hypothesize that the degree of RNA deamination may determine or reflect viral fitness and infectivity.","output":"Impact of ADAR-induced editing of minor viral RNA populations on replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has supposed a global health emergency affecting millions of people, with particular severity in the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) could represent an especially vulnerable population because of the high mortality rates reported for respiratory infections. However, the number of COVID-19 cases reported among PAH and CTEPH patients is surprisingly low. Furthermore, the clinical picture that has been described in these patients is far from the severity that experts would expect. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature between patients with PAH/CTEPH and COVID-19, leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and inflammation. In this picture, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays an essential role, being directly involved in the pathophysiology of both clinical entities. Some of these common characteristics could explain the good adaptation of PAH and CTEPH patients to COVID-19, who could also have obtained a benefit from the diseases specific treatments (anticoagulant and pulmonary vasodilators), probably due to its protective effect on the endothelium. Additionally, these common features could also lead to PAH/CTEPH as a potential sequelae of COVID-19. Throughout this comprehensive review, we describe the similarities and differences between both conditions and the possible pathophysiological and therapeutic-based mechanisms leading to the low incidence and severity of COVID-19 reported in PAH/CTEPH patients to date.

Further, there is evidence to suggest that this relationship is a function of task complexity, and partially mediated by learning performance in workplace induction and training activities. Simultaneously, evidence is mounting that stable individual differences in implicit learning exist, which are at least partially independent of traditional measures of intelligence.

Systems theory constructs effective models for the analysis of complex systems since this comprehensive theory is capable of providing links between the problems and dynamics of systems. Particularly, for the complex and challenging environments, the solutions to the problems can be managed more effectively based on a systems approach. Neurological diseases concern the brain which has a complex structure and dynamics. Being equipped with the accurate medical knowledge plays a critical role in tackling these neurological problems. The interconnected relationships require a carefully-characterized transdisciplinary approach integrating systems conduct and mathematical modelling. Effective solutions lie in cognitive status, namely awareness and a satisfactory level of health knowledge. Within this framework, this study aims at revealing the lack of required general and medical health knowledge on neurological diseases (Alzheimers, dementia, Parkinsons, stroke, epilepsy and migraine) among individuals. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted on 381 respondents, through which awareness on medical knowledge and general health knowledge were assessed for each disease. The following approaches (methods) were applied: firstly, rule-based decision tree algorithm was applied since its structure enables the interpretation of the data and works effectively with feature computations. Subsequently, statistical analyses were performed. The decision tree analyses and statistical analyses reveal parallel results with one another, which demonstrate that when compared with the knowledge of elder people, the knowledge of young population is limited in general and medical health knowledge. Compared with previous works, no related work exists in the literature where a transdisciplinary approach with these proposed methods are used. The experimental results demonstrate the significant difference between medical knowledge and general health knowledge among individuals depending on different attributes.

Here we explored the possibility that different statins might differ in their ability to exert protective effects based on computational predictions. MethodsA Bayesian network tool was used to predict drugs that shift the host transcriptomic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection towards a healthy state. Drugs were predicted using 14 RNA-sequencing datasets from 72 autopsy tissues and 465 COVID-19 patient samples or from cultured human cells and organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a total of 2,436 drugs investigated. Top drug predictions included statins, which were tested in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and human endothelial cells infected with a related OC43 coronavirus. A database containing over 4,000 COVID-19 patients on statins was also analyzed to determine mortality risk in patients prescribed specific statins versus untreated matched controls. FindingsSimvastatin was among the most highly predicted compounds (14/14 datasets) and five other statins were predicted to be active in > 50% of analyses. In vitro testing of SARS- CoV-2 infected cells revealed simvastatin to be a potent inhibitor whereas most other statins were less effective. Simvastatin also inhibited OC43 infection and reduced cytokine production in endothelial cells. Analysis of the clinical database revealed that reduced mortality risk was only observed in COVID-19 patients prescribed a subset of statins, including simvastatin and atorvastatin. InterpretationDifferent statins may differ in their ability to sustain the lives of COVID-19 patients despite having a shared target and lipid-modifying mechanism of action.

ANS function is altered in common diffuse and focal conditions and heralds the beginning of environmental and disease stresses. Reliable, sensitive, and quantitative biomarkers, first defined in healthy participants, could discriminate among clinically useful changes in ANS function. This framework combines controlled autonomic testing with feature extraction during physiological responses. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals were assessed in two morning and two afternoon sessions over two weeks. Each session included five standard clinical tests probing autonomic function: squat test, cold pressor test, diving reflex test, deep breathing, and Valsalva maneuver. Noninvasive sensors captured continuous electrocardiography, blood pressure, breathing, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter. Heart rate, heart rate variability, mean arterial pressure, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter responses to the perturbations were extracted, and averages across participants were computed. A template matching algorithm calculated scaling and stretching features that optimally fit the average to an individual response. These features were grouped based on test and modality to derive sympathetic and parasympathetic indices for this healthy population. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation (p = 0.000377) was found between sympathetic amplitude response and body mass index. Additionally, longer duration and larger amplitude sympathetic and longer duration parasympathetic responses occurred in afternoon testing sessions; larger amplitude parasympathetic responses occurred in morning sessions. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the robustness and sensitivity of an algorithmic approach to extract multimodal responses from standard tests. This novel method of quantifying ANS function can be used for early diagnosis, measurement of disease progression, or treatment evaluation.

Neurologic symptoms have been reported as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. We aimed to determine whether neurologic manifestations are common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to describe their main characteristics. METHODS: We systematically reviewed all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in a Spanish population during March 2020. Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurologic clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men), 57.4% developed some form of neurologic symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection. Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases. Disorders of consciousness occurred commonly (19.6%), mostly in older patients and in severe and advanced COVID-19 stages.

With the aim of sharing new insights for the design of novel Mpro inhibitors, our research group developed a machine learning approach using the support vector machine (SVM) classification. Starting from a dataset of two million commercially available compounds, the model was able to classify two hundred novel chemo-types as potentially active against the viral protease. The compounds labelled as actives by SVM were next evaluated through consensus docking studies on two PDB structures and their binding mode was compared to well-known protease inhibitors. The best five compounds selected by consensus docking were then submitted to molecular dynamics to deepen binding interactions stability.

Human mobility is an important factor influencing the spread of diseases possibly leading to a high burden of disease at the country level. Drastic control measures, such as complete lockdown, are effective epidemic controls, yet in practice one hopes that a partial shutdown would suffice. It is an open problem to determine how much mobility can be allowed while controlling an outbreak. In this paper, we use statistical models to relate human mobility to the excess death in Ecuador while controlling for demographic factors. The mobility index provided by GRANDATA, based on mobile phone users, represents the change of number of out-of-home events with respect to a benchmark date (March 2nd, 2020). The study confirms the global trend that more men are dying than expected compared to women, and that people under 30 show less deaths than expected, particularly individuals younger than 20 with a death rate reduction between 22 and 27%. The weekly median mobility time series shows a sharp decrease in human mobility immediately after a national lockdown was declared on March 17, 2020 and a progressive increase towards the pre-lockdown level within two months. Relating median mobility to excess deaths shows a lag in its effect: first, a decrease in mobility in the previous two to three weeks decreases excess death and, more novel, we found an increase of mobility variability four weeks prior increases the number of excess deaths.","output":"Assessing the impact of human mobility to predict regional excess death in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities are centres of innovation and wealth creation, but also hotspots of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space, which are all detrimental to human health.

AIM: This review explored the potential of Malawi's traditional medicinal plants for the management of COVID-19. METHODS: The authors searched on PubMed and Google scholar for medicinal plants that are used in Malawi and published in openly available peer reviewed journals. Plants linked with antiviral treatment, anti-COVID-19 activity or COVID-19 symptoms management were targeted. These included activity against pneumonia, inflammation, cough, difficulty in breathing, pain/aches, fever, diarrhoea, rheumatism, fatigue, asthma, immunocompromised and cardiovascular diseases. RESULTS: 11 studies were found with 306 plant species. 127 plant species had at least one COVID-19 related pharmacological activity. Of these plant species, the number of herbal entities used for each indication was: pain/aches (87), fever (2), pneumonia (9), breathing/asthma problems (5), coughing (11), diarrhoea (1), immunosuppression (8), blood issues (10), fatigue (2), heart problems (11), inflammation (8), rheumatism (10) and viral diseases (12).

The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA determined by Northern blotting was observed first in the olfactory bulb and the brain stem on day 5 after intranasal inoculation of HSV-1, and thereafter iNOS mRNA was detected in other brain regions, i.e., cerebrum and cerebellum. In various parts of the brain, excessive NO production was identified by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The temporal and spatial patterns of iNOS expression coincided with those of viral propagation, as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction for HSV-1 gene expression as well as by the plaque-forming assay. Immunohistochemical study determined that iNOS was localized mainly in monocyte-derived macrophages. Treatment of virus-infected animals with the NOS inhibitor Nomega-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), but not Nomega-monomethyl-d-arginine, significantly ameliorated not only clinical symptoms such as paralysis and seizures but also mortality. Virus yield from brain tissue was not affected by l-NMMA treatment. It is of interest that increased expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 was observed in the HSV-1-infected brain; this increased expression was strongly inhibited by l-NMMA treatment.

Blood samples included hormone analyses, metabolic parameters, lipids, and biomarkers reflecting endothelial activation. RED-S risk was assessed through the low energy availability in female questionnaire (LEAF-Q), and body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We found no significant differences in brachial FMD, PWV, CAR %, cIMT, or biomarkers reflecting endothelial activation between the two groups. Forty-four percent of the runners had a LEAF-Q score consistent with being at risk of RED-S. Runners showed significantly higher HDL-cholesterol and insulin sensitivity compared to controls. In conclusion, Norwegian female elite runners had an as good vascular function and morphology as inactive women of the same age.","output":"Vascular Function in Norwegian Female Elite Runners: A Cross-Sectional, Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is serious and there is no effective treatment to date.

This study estimates the per-patient cost of inpatient care for adult COVID-19 patients seen at >800 US hospitals. METHODS: Patients aged 18 years with 1 hospitalization during March 2020CJuly 2021 with a COVID-19 diagnosis code in a large electronic administrative discharge database were included. We used validated costs when reported; otherwise, costs were calculated using charges multiplied by cost-to-charge ratios. We estimated costs of inpatient care per patient overall and by severity indicator, age, sex, underlying medical conditions, and acute complications of COVID-19 using a generalized linear model with log link function and gamma distribution. RESULTS: The overall cost among 654673 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was $16.2 billion. Estimated per-patient hospitalization cost was $24 826. Among surviving patients, estimated per-patient cost was $13 090 without intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), $21 222 with ICU admission alone, and $59 742 with IMV. Estimated per-patient cost among patients who died was $27 017. Adjusted cost differential was higher among patients with certain underlying conditions (eg, chronic kidney disease [$12 391], liver disease [$8878], cerebrovascular disease [$7267], and obesity [$5933]) and acute complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [$43 912], pneumothorax [$25 240], and intracranial hemorrhage [$22 280]).

However, those models lack to accurately classify students into various behavioral patterns, employing nominal class labels, rather than ordinal ones. Meanwhile, such models cannot analyze high-dimensional learning behaviors among learners according to students interaction with course videos. Since online learning data are huge, the main challenges associated with data are insufficient labeling and classification using nominal class labels. In this study, we proposed a model based on Graph Convolutional Network, as a semi-supervised classification task to classify students engagement in various behavioral patterns. First, we proposed a label function to label datasets instead of manual labeling, in which input and output data are labeled for classification to provide a learning foundation for future data processing. Accordingly, we hypothesized four behavioral patterns, namely (High-engagement, Normal-engagement, At-risk, and Potential-At-risk) based on students' engagement with course videos and their performance on the assessments/quizzes conducted after. Then, we built a heterogeneous knowledge graph representing learners, course videos as entities, and capturing semantic relationships among students according to shared knowledge concepts in videos. Our model intrinsically works for heterogeneous knowledge graphs as a semi-supervised node classification task. It was evaluated on a real-world dataset across multiple settings to achieve a better predictive classification model.

We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4  20.5 vs 82.0  30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality.

METHODS LCN2 knockout (LCN2KO) mice and wild-type littermates were used to evaluate the effect of LCN2 on insulin sensitivity and hepatic gluconeogenesis through pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, respectively. LCN2KO mice and WT mice in vivo, and in vitro HepG2 cells were co-transfected with adenoviral FoxO1-siRNA (Ad-FoxO1-siRNA) or adenovirus expressing constitutively active form of AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK), or dominant negative adenovirus AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), the relative mRNA and protein levels of two key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) were measured. RESULTS Improved insulin sensitivity and inhibited gluconeogenesis in the LCN2KO mice were confirmed by pyruvate tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Nuclear FoxO1 and its downstream genes PEECK and G6P were decreased in the livers of the LCN2KO mice, and AMPK activity was stimulated and directly phosphorylated FoxO1. In vitro, AMPK activity was inhibited in HepG2 cells overexpressing LCN2 leading to a decrease in phosphorylated FoxO1 and an increase in nuclear FoxO1.

Information included age, weight, sex, neuter status, and breed. Specific clinical signs and treatments were reviewed in a random sample of 400 affected dogs. The association between potential risk factors and a VAAE was estimated by use of multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS 4,678 adverse events (38.2/10,000 dogs vaccinated) were associated with administration of 3,439,576 doses of vaccine to 1,226,159 dogs.

Comparison of the results of calculations of the epidemic spread, as well as the values of the seven-day incidence values with the corresponding observation data, shows their good correspondence for each of the selected age groups. The greatest influence on the overall spread of the epidemic is in the 20-40 age groups. The relatively low level of vaccination and the high intensity of contact in these age groups contributes to the emergence of new waves of the epidemic, which is especially active when the virus mutates and the lockdown conditions are relaxed. The intensity of the epidemic in the 90+ age group has some peculiarities compared to other groups, which may be explained by differences in contact patterns among individuals in this age group compared to others. Approximate ratios for estimating mortality as a function of the intensity of infection for individual age groups are provided. The proposed stratified ASILV model by age group will allow more detailed and accurate prediction of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including when new, more transmissible versions of the virus mutate and emerge.","output":"The age-stratified analytical model for the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all the universities in Indonesia to switch their on-campus learning to online learning. Some universities could only provide emergency online learning since they were not ready to conduct proper online learning. This switching may decrease the students engagement with learning and impact their perceived competencies. Operational accounting competencies (OAC) are important basic competencies which allow accounting graduates to perform generic jobs in their field. Hence, this study attempts to identify the impact of emergency online learning on students perceived OAC. A survey was used to collect data on the students engagement with synchronous and asynchronous learning and OAC. The study collected 122 items of data and analysed them using descriptive and path analyses. The students have reported that synchronous learningonline classroom engagementonly had a small impact on improving their perceived OAC. The improvement in the students perceived OAC was mainly caused by asynchronous learning in terms of active, collaborative and enrichment learning. Lecturers should improve their skills in organising online learning to increase their students engagement.

Diagnostics is one area where biotechnology has been critical. Diagnostic tests play a vital role in managing a viral threat by facilitating the detection of infected and/or recovered individuals. From the perspective of what information is provided, these tests fall into two major categories, molecular and serological. Molecular diagnostic techniques assay whether a virus is present in a biological sample, thus making it possible to identify individuals who are currently infected. Additionally, when the immune system is exposed to a virus, it responds by producing antibodies specific to the virus. Serological tests make it possible to identify individuals who have mounted an immune response to a virus of interest and therefore facilitate the identification of individuals who have previously encountered the virus. These two categories of tests provide different perspectives valuable to understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Within these categories, different biotechnological approaches offer specific advantages and disadvantages.

The virus manifests aggressive behavior with severe clinical presentation and high mortality rate, especially among the elderly and patients living with chronic diseases. In the recent years, the role of gut microbiota, in health and disease, has been progressively studied and highlighted. It is through gut microbiota-organ bidirectional pathways, such as gut-brain axis, gut-liver axis, and gut-lung axis, that the role of gut microbiota in prompting lung disease, among other diseases, has been proposed and accepted. It is also known that respiratory viral infections, such as COVID-19, induce alterations in the gut microbiota, which can influence immunity. Based on the fact that gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and in patients with certain chronic diseases, which constitute two of the primary fatality groups in COVID-19 infections, it can be assumed that the gut microbiota may play a role in COVID-19 pathology and fatality rate. Improving gut microbiota diversity through personalized nutrition and supplementation with prebiotics/probiotics will mend the immunity of the body and hence could be one of the prophylactic strategies by which the impact of COVID-19 can be minimized in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. In this chapter, the role of dysbiosis in COVID-19 will be clarified and the possibility of using co-supplementation of personalized prebiotics/probiotics with current therapies will be discussed.","output":"Gut-lung cross talk in COVID-19 pathology and fatality rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryopreservation, the most common method of preserving stem cells, requires post-processing because it produces trauma to the cells. Post-thawing trauma typically induces cell death, elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, and lowers mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Although this trauma has been solved using antioxidants, we attempted to use photobiomodulation (PBM) instead of chemical treatment. We used a 950-nm near-infrared LED to create a PBM device and chose a pulsed-wave mode of 30 Hz and a 30% duty cycle. Near-infrared radiation (NIR) at 950 nm was effective in reducing cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide induced-oxidative stress. Cryodamage also leads to apoptosis of cells, which can be avoided by irradiation at 950 nm NIR. Irradiation as post-processing for cryopreservation had an antioxidant effect that reduced both cellular and mitochondrial ROS. It also increased mitochondrial mass and activated mitochondrial activity, resulting in increased MMP, ATP generation, and increased cytochrome c oxidase activity. In addition, NIR increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a biomarker of differentiation. As a result, we identified that 950 nm NIR PBM solves cryodamage in human stem cells from the apical papilla, indicating its potential as an alternative to antioxidants for treatment of post-thawing trauma, and further estimated its mechanism.","output":"Photobiomodulation as an antioxidant substitute in post-thawing trauma of human stem cells from the apical papilla"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: First reported in December of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a profound impact on the implementation of care Here, we describe our institutional experience with a rapid influx of patients at the epicenter of the pandemic METHODS: We retrospectively review our experience with the departments of cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and critical care medicine and summarize protocols developed in the midst of the pandemic RESULTS: The rapid influx of patients requiring an intensive level of care required a complete restructuring of units, including the establishment of a new COVID-19 negative unit for the care of patients requiring urgent or emergent non-COVID-19 related care including open-heart surgery This unique unit allowed for the delivery of safe and effective care in the epicenter of the pandemic CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate the response of a large tertiary academic medical center to the COVID-19 pandemic Specifically, we demonstrate how rapid structural changes can allow for the continued delivery of cardiac surgical care with similar outcomes as those reported before the pandemic","output":"A Perspective from New York of COVID 19: Effect and impact on cardiac surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conversations on social media (SM) are increasingly being used to investigate social issues on the web, such as online harassment and rumor spread. For such issues, a common thread of research uses adversarial reactions, e.g., replies pointing out factual inaccuracies in rumors. Though adversarial reactions are prevalent in online conversations, inferring those adverse views (or stance) from the text in replies is difficult and requires complex natural language processing (NLP) models. Moreover, conventional NLP models for stance mining need labeled data for supervised learning. Getting labeled conversations can itself be challenging as conversations can be on any topic, and topics change over time. These challenges make learning the stance a difficult NLP problem. In this research, we first create a new stance dataset comprised of three different topics by labeling both users' opinions on the topics (as in pro/con) and users' stance while replying to others' posts (as in favor/oppose). As we find limitations with supervised approaches, we propose a weakly-supervised approach to predict the stance in Twitter replies. Our novel method allows using a smaller number of hashtags to generate weak labels for Twitter replies. Compared to supervised learning, our method improves the mean F1-macro by 8\\\\% on the hand-labeled dataset without using any hand-labeled examples in the training set.

An outbreak of a previously unknown disease, prolonged self-isolation, contradictory information in the media, and an economic crisis  all these are today's realities that have arisen due to the coronavirus pandemic. In such conditions, society is particularly in need of developing measures to overcome post-traumatic stress, which is preceded by the identification of its patterns, connections with certain psychological and other factors. Hypothesis: negative coping strategies and low indicators of subjective well-being are correlated with high indicators of post-traumatic stress in a sample of Chinese students. As a sample a total of 306 Chinese students were interviewed, including 161 students studying in China and 145 students studying outside their country (Russia, England, USA). Methods: Subjective well-being (IOW);post-traumatic stress self-assessment questionnaire (PTSD);assessment of stress management style (SCSD). A sample of students from China showed a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.221**), the overall mood and stress index (0.356**), and subjective well-being and stress (0.191*);negative correlation between active coping strategies and the overall mood index (-0.321**). In the sample of Chinese students studying abroad, there is a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.394**), active coping strategies and subjective well-being (0.283*), and the mood and stress index (0.178*);a negative correlation was found between active coping strategies and the overall mood of Chinese students (-0.325**).

Many have identified challenges associated with addressing the needs of modern medical learners. One particular trend we have observed is that medical students are increasingly requesting an answer key for all aspects of their medical education. Students often expect to have the correct answers readily available to them to ensure they have reached the correct conclusion and to determine the precise knowledge they need to master. Yet, for much of medicine, and particularly in the care of critically ill patients with multisystem disease in intensive care units, answers are uncertain, and the body of knowledge is ever-growing. Students regular requests for solutions to be provided to them threaten to undermine their development into critically thinking, self-sufficient physicians. We outline three potential contributors to this multifactorial problem and offer corresponding pedagogical solutions. Specifically, we address how prioritizing outcomes over process, discomfort with uncertainty, and fear of faltering can cause students to seek excessive levels of support that may ultimately do more harm than good. Addressing students concerns in these three key areas will not only serve students well during their undergraduate medical training but will also equip them with the skills needed to succeed in the clinical realm. To produce physicians capable of navigating an increasingly uncertain world, medical educators will need to help students appreciate that finding the answer is more complex than being provided an answer key.","output":"Medical Students and the Drive for a Single Right Answer: Teaching Complexity and Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To determine whether perceived changes (i.e. perception of engagement during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic) in specific health behaviors differ by weight status (i.e. healthy weight, overweight, obese). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. Recruitment took place between June-August 2020, via social media posts and Qualtrics online panels. SETTING: Participants completed the survey online through the Qualtrics platform. SAMPLE: Analyses included N = 502 participants (&#8805;18 years); 45.2% healthy weight (n = 227), 28.5% overweight (n = 143), and 26.3% obese (n = 132). MEASURES: Study-specific survey items included questions about demographics and perceived changes in health behaviors. ANALYSIS: Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed the odds of perceiving changes in health behaviors considered a risk for weight gain. RESULTS: Participants with obesity, but not overweight, were significantly more likely to report deleterious changes to health behaviors compared to healthy weight peers, including: (1) decreased fruit/vegetable consumption [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.13, 3.26)]; (2) increased processed food consumption [AOR = 1.85; 95%CI: (1.15, 3.00)]; (3) increased caloric intake [AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: (1.06, 2.61)]; (4) decreased physical activity [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.31, 3.28)]; and (5) deterioration in sleep quality [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.32, 3.25)].

This study aims at comparatively analyzing COVID-19's effect on cancer care from both patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: A multi-institutional survey was developed to assess COVID-19-specific concerns regarding treatment, safety, and emotional stress through 5-point Likert-type prompts and open-ended questions before and during the pandemic. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to analyze before/during answers for providers and patients independently. Open-ended responses were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 104 (69.3%) patients and 50 (50%) providers. Patients demonstrated a significant change in only 1 of 15 Likert prompts. Most significant were increased concern regarding susceptibility to infection [z = 2.536, p = 0.011] and concerns regarding their cancer outcome [z = 4.572, p < 0.001]. Non-physician providers demonstrated significant change in 8 of 13 Likert prompts, whereas physicians had all 13 Likert prompts change in the COVID-19 setting. Physicians believed care to be more poorly planned [z = -3.857, p &#8804; 0.001], availability of protective personal equipment to be more limited [z = -4.082, p < 0.001], and were significantly concerned infecting family members [z = 4.965, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: While patients had more difficulty coping with their cancer, they did not perceive significant differences in their actual treatment. This suggests the need for a renewed focus on patients coping with cancer.

Multiple studies strived to evaluate the benefits of ECMO support, but its efficacy remains controversial with still inconsistent and sparse information. Methods: This retrospective analysis included patients with ECMO support, admitted between January 2010 and December 2019 at a tertiary university ECMO referral centre in Austria. The primary endpoint of the study was overall all-cause three-month mortality with risk factors and predictors of mortality. Secondary endpoints covered the analysis of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients needing ECMO, including incidence and type of adverse events during support. Results: In total, 358 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and received ECMO support due to cardiogenic shock (258, 72%), respiratory failure (88, 25%) or hypothermia (12, 3%). In total, 41% (145) of patients died within the first three months, with the median time to death of 9 (1C87) days. The multivariate analysis identified hypothermia (HR 3.8, p < 0.001), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (HR 1.0, p < 0.001), ECMO initiation on weekends (HR 1.6, p = 0.016) and haemorrhage during ECMO support (HR 1.7, p = 0.001) as factors with higher risk for mortality. Finally, the most frequent adverse event was haemorrhage (160, 45%) followed by thrombosis. Conclusions: ECMO is an invasive advanced support system with a high risk of complications. Nevertheless, well-selected patients can be successfully rescued from life-threatening conditions by prolonging the therapeutic window to either solve the underlying problem or install a long-term assist device. Hypothermia, disease severity, initiation on weekends and haemorrhage during ECMO support increase the risk for mortality. In the case of decision making in a setting of limited (ICU) resources, the reported risk factors for mortality may be contemplable, especially when judging a possible ECMO support termination.","output":"ECMO Predictors of Mortality: A 10-Year Referral Centre Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-pandemic has facilitated the implementation of telemedicine in both clinical practice and research. We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Personal contact remains essential to ascertain adherence to teletreatment. SUMMARY: The availability of different telemedicine tools for remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment is increasing.

We aimed to evaluate and compare the positive rate with molecular POC tests and DIAs in detecting influenza virus A, B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 2019-2020. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult outpatients with influenza-like illness who visited four hospitals and clinics in Japan. DIAs were performed at each facility. The clinical diagnosis was determined based on the findings of DIAs, history taking, and physical assessment. Molecular POC test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed later. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were evaluated. The positive rate for influenza virus with molecular POC test was significantly higher than that with DIAs (51.6% versus 40.7%, p = 0.046). In patients who tested positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test, the presence of influenza virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. In a comparison between the patients who were positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test and those with both molecular POC test and DIA, the percentage of patients who sought consultation within 18 h after the onset of symptoms was significantly higher in the molecular POC test only group than in the both methods group (70.0% versus 43.2%, p = 0.044).

METHODS: A total of 383 COVID-19 patients enrolled in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, Delhi, India, were included in the present retrospective study. Patients were divided into three categories, severe (n = 141), moderate (n = 138), and mild (n = 104) based on infection severity. Various thrombotic parameters and anticoagulant levels were measured in 70 patients and further analyzed. RESULTS: Coagulopathy is seen in COVID-19 patients (n = 70) with a significant increase in fibrinogen, D-dimer levels, and prothrombin time in patients with severe and moderate disease compared to patients with a mild infection. Approximately, 70% of patients with severe and moderate disease demonstrated fibrinogen levels higher than the standard reference range. 60.41% of patients with severe disease showed significantly higher D-dimer levels. Thrombotic parameters were notably elevated in the nonsurvivors group compared to COVID-19 survivors.

As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image. Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 97.7% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 65.5% in the NAP curve.

Managers were presented with the challenge of protecting the healthcare workers from transmission of the disease within medical institutions, and issues concerning the physical and psychological depletion of personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on analyses of the structure and work processes in Central Clinical Hospital (CCH) reconstructive strategic plan was developed. It included: division of existing wards into observation and isolation wards; installing locks; weekly plan for supplying personal protection equipment (PPE); designating new access to the hospital and communication routes; training of medical and supporting staff. The plan was implemented from the first days of conversion of the hospital. RESULTS The wards of the CCH were converted for observation and isolation, and each one was fitted with sanitary locks. There was a big improvement in the supply of PPE for the medical staff. Separation of the 'dirty' and 'clean' parts of the CCH were attained, and widespread intensive training not only protected personnel against infections, but also diminished unrest which was discernable at the beginning of conversion.

RESULTS: Infants who received SD-INDO were more premature (p < 0.001) but had lower odds of PDA (OR 0.26 [0.15, 0.44], p < 0.005), PDA receiving treatment (OR 0.12 [0.03, 0.47], p < 0.005), death (OR 0.41 [0.20, 0.86], p = 0.02), and CP severity (OR 0.33 [0.12, 0.89], p = 0.03). There was less IVH (OR 0.58 [0.36, 0.94], p = 0.03) when adjusted for gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: SD-INDO is associated with decreased PDA and CP severity and improved survival.","output":"Outcomes in infants < 29 weeks of gestation following single-dose prophylactic indomethacin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of this epidemic.

METHODS Five databases were searched from inception to April 23, 2020 for randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rate of these materials. After duplicate study removal, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with the Cochrane tool, data synthesis was conducted, comparing all five tooth-coloured materials in pairs and computing the overall success rate for each one, respectively. RESULTS A total of 5615 articles were obtained by electronic and hand literature search. After the application of the eligibility criteria, ten RCTs were included in this systematic review and six RCTs for meta-analysis. Their risk of bias was assessed to be high to moderate. Due to the small number of RCTs comparing the five restorative materials in pairs investigated in the same study, only three MAs were available for heterogeneity assessment. These were: (1) between CO-RMGI (RR 1.04 [0.59, 1.84]; p = 0.88; I2 = 1%), (2) CR-CO (RR 1.12 [0.41, 3.02]; p = 0.83; I2 = 57%), and (3) between CR-RMGI (RR 1.10 [0.74, 1.63]; p = 0.65; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant differences were found between the two materials in all three comparisons. CONCLUSION CR, RMGI and CO presented no statistical differences. In comparison to other tooth-coloured materials, studies on GI were too few to allow recommendations about its use. More studies on HGVI are needed for evidence-based recommendations to be made. The evidence extracted from this meta-analysis was not strong enough (moderate), due to the small number of RCTs and the risk of bias ranging from high to moderate.

These PRMs have direct clinical and research applications. They inform clinical decision making through readily interpretable scales to which clinicians can expeditiously respond. Equally, they are increasingly forming an integral and central component of intervention and outcomes-based research. However, implementation studies are necessary to address knowledge gaps and facilitate adoption and dissemination of this approach. A natural symbiosis of the clinical and research realms is precision medicine. The foundations of precision-based interventions are now being set whereby we can maximize the quality of life and psychosocial functioning on an individual level.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. METHODS: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. MEASUREMENTS: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. CONCLUSION: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early.

However, decreases in PM2.5 concentration due to regional PM2.5 transport driven by meteorological changes, and the relationship between the PM2.5 source and receptor, are poorly understood. Therefore, this study assessed how changes in meteorology, local emissions, and regional transport from external source emissions contributed to the decrease in Wuhans PM2.5 concentration, using FLEXPART-WRF and WRF-Chem modelling experiments. The results showed that meteorological changes in central China explain up to 22.2% of the total decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in Wuhan, while the remaining 77.8% was due to air pollutant emissions reduction. Reduction in air pollutant emissions depended on both local and external sources, which contributed alomst equally to the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations (38.7% and 39.1% of the total reduction, respectively). The key emissions source areas affecting PM2.5 in Wuhan during the COVID-lockdown were identified by the FLEXPART-WRF modeling, revealing that regional-joint control measures in key areas accounted for 89.3% of the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in Wuhan.

The onus of tackling the disease relies largely on healthcare workers. However, other members of society, such as police personnel and sanitary workers, also made a major contribution in disease prevention. Despite working relentlessly, they face stigma caused by misconceptions and false information that create a health gap. This study aimed to determine the level of stigma and discrimination against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) warriors, understand its effects, and assess the community perception of the causes of stigmatization. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted for 6 months. The sample size was time-bound, and a mixed method of sampling was employed. A total of 78 COVID-19 warriors and 68 participants from the community were enrolled. Stigma assessment was based on four domains: anticipated stigma, experienced stigma, internalized stigma, and disclosure concerns. Relevant tests of significance were applied, and the data are presented in percentages and ratios. RESULTS: Of the participants, 46.1% were in the age group of 30-40 years, 47% were males, and 81% were doctors by profession and were engaged in a minimum of 6-12 h of duty for 2 weeks. Of the study population, 85.5% had anticipated stigma, whereas 72.2% had experienced stigma, 43.4% had internalized stigma, and 76.3% had disclosure concerns. Internalized stigma was found to be significantly associated with age (p<0.05) and personal attributes (p<0.05). Of the community participants, 47.1% had a doctor in their neighborhood, and contracting COVID-19 was the primary concern of 44.1% due to the presence of a COVID-19 warrior in their vicinity. Other concerns, such as having to take extra precautions and social distancing being compromised, were also reported.

The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) will test whether Communities That HEAL (CTH), a community-engaged intervention, can decrease opioid-involved deaths in intervention communities (n = 33), relative to wait-list communities (n = 34), from four states. The CTH intervention seeks to facilitate widespread implementation of three evidence-based practices (EBPs) with the potential to reduce opioid-involved overdose fatalities: overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND), effective delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and safer opioid analgesic prescribing. A key challenge was delineating an EBP implementation approach useful for all HCS communities. METHODS: A workgroup composed of EBP experts from HCS research sites used literature reviews and expert consensus to: 1) compile strategies and associated resources for implementing EBPs primarily targeting individuals 18 and older; and 2) determine allowable community flexibility in EBP implementation. The workgroup developed the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA) to organize EBP strategies and resources to facilitate EBP implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The ORCCA includes required and recommended EBP strategies, priority populations, and community settings. Each EBP has a menu of strategies from which communities can select and implement with a minimum of five strategies required: one for OEND, three for MOUD, and one for prescription opioid safety. Identification and engagement of high-risk populations in OEND and MOUD is an ORCCArequirement. To ensure CTH has community-wide impact, implementation of at least one EBP strategy is required in healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal justice settings, with communities identifying particular organizations to engage in HCS-facilitated EBP implementation.","output":"The Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA): Evidence-based Practices in the HEALing Communities Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that causes severe disease with fatal outcomes; however, there are currently no approved vaccines or specific treatments against MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunits, with the S1 subunit being a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant RVP, which expresses S1 fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ectodomains of the RV-glycoprotein (RV-G), was developed using a reverse genetics method and named RVP-MERS/S1. Following generation of RVP-MERS/S1 and RVP, our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties, with the expression of S1 in RVP-MERS/S1-infected cells confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot, and the immunogenicity and pathogenicity evaluated using mouse infection experiments. We observed no rabies-associated signs or symptoms in mice inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1. Moreover, virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against both MERS-CoV and RV were induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with RVP-MERS/S1.

S1P receptors are involved in several cellular and physiological events, including lymphocyte/hematopoietic cell trafficking. An S1P gradient (low in tissues, high in blood), maintained by synthetic and degradative enzymes, regulates lymphocyte trafficking. Because lymphocytes live long (which is critical for adaptive immunity) and recirculate thousands of times, the S1P-S1PR pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. The S1PR1 modulators lead to receptor internalization, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation, which renders lymphocytes incapable of following the S1P gradient and prevents their access to inflammation sites. These drugs might also block lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes by inhibiting transendothelial migration. Targeting S1PRs as a therapeutic strategy was first employed for multiple sclerosis (MS), and four S1P modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod) are currently approved for its treatment. New S1PR modulators are under clinical development for MS, and their uses are being evaluated to treat other immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and psoriasis. A clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 treated with ozanimod is ongoing. Ozanimod and etrasimod have shown promising results in IBD; while in phase 2 clinical trials, ponesimod has shown improvement in 77% of the patients with psoriasis. Cenerimod and amiselimod have been tested in SLE patients. Fingolimod, etrasimod, and IMMH001 have shown efficacy in RA preclinical studies. Concerns relating to S1PR modulators are leukopenia, anemia, transaminase elevation, macular edema, teratogenicity, pulmonary disorders, infections, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, S1PR modulators exhibit different pharmacokinetics; a well-established first-dose event associated with S1PR modulators can be mitigated by gradual up-titration. In conclusion, S1P modulators represent a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for immune-mediated diseases.","output":"Targeting Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling in Immune-Mediated Diseases: Beyond Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing an unprecedented crisis of COVID-19 pandemic.

Main outcome measures: Prevalence estimates by ethnicity (%, 95% CI) of single and multiple vulnerabilities in child wellbeing within and across four domains (home, family, relationships; material resources; friends and school; subjective wellbeing). Results Only 10% of children have no vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing; 10% have one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains. The highest prevalence estimates were for being bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 51.9 to 53.4%), keeping worries to oneself (31.2%, 30.5 to 31.9%), having no park near home (30.8%, 30.1 to 31.5%) and worrying all the time about how much money their family has (26.3%, 25.6 to 27%). Boys were consistently significantly more likely than girls to report all of the vulnerabilities in the Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, and the majority of indicators in the other domains, and in all domains except Friends and School, boys were significantly more likely to have at least one vulnerability. Girls were significantly more likely to report not having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9 to 17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8 to 13.2%), being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7 to 56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.6 to 50.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4 to 12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95% CI: 9.7 to 11.0%). Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer than White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well (6.3%,5.6 to 7.1% vs. 4.1%,3.6 to 4.6%) and to have no access to the internet at home (22.3%,21 to 23.6% vs. 18%,17 to 18.9%). Children with Pakistani heritage were more likely than White British children to say they had no park near their home where they can play with friends (32.7%,31.6 to 33.9% vs. 29.9%,28.6 to 31.3%), to report not having three meals a day (17.9%,16.9 to 18.8% vs. 11.9%,10.9 to 12.9%) and to worry all the time about how much money their families have (29.3%,28.2 to 30.3%) vs. 21.6%,20.4 to 22.9%). Gypsy/Irish Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some or all of the time (42.2%,35.4 to 49.4% vs. 53.8%,52.3 to 55.3%), but more likely to say they were mean to others all the time (9.9%,6.3 to 15.2% vs. 4%,3.5 to 4.7%) and can never work out what to do when things are hard (15.2%,10.6 to 21.2% vs. 9%, 8.2 to 9.9%). We considered six vulnerabilities to be of particular concern during the current Covid-19 pandemic and associated national and local lockdowns: family never gets along well together; no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Pre-pandemic, 37.4% (36.6 to 38.3%) of Bradford children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.9 to 30.4%) had more than one.

METHODS The IAS is a stainless steel sterilizable ring which fits around the SDF probe tip. The IAS creates adhesion to the imaged tissue by application of negative pressure. The effects of the IAS on the sublingual microcirculatory flow velocities, the force required to induce pressure artifacts (PA), the time to acquire a stable image, and the duration of stable imaging were assessed in healthy volunteers. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of the SDF setup in combination with the IAS, simultaneous bilateral sublingual imaging of the microcirculation were performed during a lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. One SDF device was operated handheld; the second was fitted with the IAS and held in position by a mechanic arm. Lateral drift, number of losses of image stability and duration of stable imaging of the two methods were compared. RESULTS Five healthy volunteers were studied. The IAS did not affect microcirculatory flow velocities. A significantly greater force had to applied onto the tissue to induced PA with compared to without IAS (0.25 +/- 0.15 N without vs. 0.62 +/- 0.05 N with the IAS, p < 0.001). The IAS ensured an increased duration of a stable image sequence (8 +/- 2 s without vs. 42 +/- 8 s with the IAS, p < 0.001). The time required to obtain a stable image sequence was similar with and without the IAS. In eight mechanically ventilated patients undergoing a LRM the use of the IAS resulted in a significantly reduced image drifting and enabled the acquisition of significantly longer stable image sequences (24 +/- 5 s without vs. 67 +/- 14 s with the IAS, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS The present study has validated the use of an IAS for improvement of SDF imaging by demonstrating that the IAS did not affect microcirculatory perfusion in the microscopic field of view. The IAS improved both axial and lateral SDF image stability and thereby increased the critical force required to induce pressure artifacts. The IAS ensured a significantly increased duration of maintaining a stable image sequence.","output":"Improvement of sidestream dark field imaging with an image acquisition stabilizer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses are an important cause of nonbattle injury disease and contribute to the top seven reasons for medical encounters. In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS: We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS: During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","output":"Local Respiratory Viral Surveillance Can Focus Public Health Interventions to Decrease Influenza Disease Burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The University of Bergamo switched from regular classes to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic during March 2020, without leaving to the students the chance to meet their teachers in the traditional setting even once.

Over a period of 7 weeks from early February through late March 2021, wastewater originating from the residence hall was collected as grab samples 3 times per week. During this time, there was no detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in the residence hall wastewater stream. Aiming to obtain a sample more representative of the residence hall community, a decision was made to use passive samplers beginning in late March onwards. Adopting a Moore swab approach, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater samples just 2 days after passive samplers were deployed. These samples also tested positive for the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant of concern (VOC) using RT-qPCR. The positive result triggered a public health case-finding response, including a mobile testing unit deployed to the residence hall the following day, with testing of nearly 200 students and staff, which identified two laboratory-confirmed cases of Alpha variant COVID-19. These individuals were relocated to a separate quarantine facility, averting an outbreak on campus. Aggregating wastewater and clinical data, the campus wastewater surveillance program has yielded the first estimates of fecal shedding rates of the Alpha VOC of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals from a nonclinical setting. IMPORTANCE Among early adopters of wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 have been colleges and universities throughout North America, many of whom are using this approach to monitor congregate living facilities for early evidence of COVID-19 infection as an integral component of campus screening programs. Yet, while there have been numerous examples where wastewater monitoring on a university campus has detected evidence for infection among community members, there are few examples where this monitoring triggered a public health response that may have averted an actual outbreak. This report details a wastewater-testing program targeting a residence hall on a university campus during spring 2021, when there was mounting concern globally over the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, reported to be more transmissible than the wild-type Wuhan strain. In this communication, we present a clear example of how wastewater monitoring resulted in actionable responses by university administration and public health, which averted an outbreak of COVID-19 on a university campus.","output":"Averting an Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Residence Hall through Wastewater Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to measure the effect of work-family conflict on employee performance of the part-time employee of a packaging industry in Tangerang which are mediated by readiness for change.

AIMS: To determine the user and clinician satisfaction during this period and compare to a pre-COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: A prospectively collected voluntary questionnaire following the telehealth appointment at a tertiary-level hospital with all adult and paediatric-based specialities was conducted over two time periods: COVID-19 (16 March 2020 to 15 April 2020) and pre-COVID-19 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). There were four groups of participants: patients; parents; adult-based clinicians; and paediatric-based clinicians. The outcomes assessed included perceived standard of care, willingness for repeat telehealth consultations, and patient and parental perceptions of safety. RESULTS: Five thousand and thirty-three telehealth consultations occurred in the COVID-19 period with 1757 questionnaires completed, compared to 1917 consultations with 271 questionnaires completed in the pre-COVID-19 period. Clinicians were more likely to have previously used telehealth in both time periods than end-users. In COVID-19, 1240 actual onsite hospital outpatients' visits were prevented. All groups reported a good overall impression of the telehealth quality; patients/parents scored higher compared to clinicians: 3.6/4 versus 3.3/4, P = 0.02 (pre-COVID-19) and 3.3/4 versus 2.8/4, P = 0.001 (COVID-19). The majority of patients and parents (90%, 1379/1528) felt safer by having a telehealth appointment compared to a face-to-face appointment in the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive literature search for preventive measures and experimental treatment options. In this review, we have focused our discussion on the risk of disease transmission, supportive treatment, and possible treatment options based on available evidence. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We performed a literature search on google scholar, PubMed, and society guidelines for literature related to COVID 19 and previous coronavirus pandemics. We included data review articles, observational studies, and controlled trials to synthesize the treatment options for COVID 19. FINDINGS: In this article, we have extensively reviewed and discussed recommendations from various world organizations for the public and healthcare workers. We have also discussed currently available experimental treatments since there is no proven treatment for COVID 19. The best method of dealing with the current outbreak is to reduce the community spread and thus flatten the curve. Although Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Azithromycin have been tried, passive immunity through convalescent serum and vaccine is still at an experimental stage. Patients with severe COVID 19 infections could be considered for this experimental treatment through various national randomized control trials, which may eventually lead to an evidence-based treatment strategy.

INTERVENTIONS Attempted resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Out of 1,094 patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period, 63 patients suffered from in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation and were included in this study. The median age was 66 years, and 49.2% were males. The majority of patients were African Americans (90.5%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88.9%), obesity (69.8%), diabetes (60.3%), and chronic kidney disease (33.3%). Eighteen patients (28.9%) had a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0-2. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (63.5%), fever (52.4%), and cough (46%). The median duration of symptoms prior to admission was 14 days. During hospital course, 66.7% patients developed septic shock, and 84.1% had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest, 81% were on ventilator, 60.3% were on vasopressors, and 39.7% were on dialysis. The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest (84.1%) occurred in the ICU. Time to initiation of advanced cardiac life support protocol was less than 1 minute for all in-hospital cardiac arrest in the ICU and less than 2 minutes for the remaining patients. The most common initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (58.7%) and asystole (33.3%). Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 29% patients, it was brief in all of them. The in-hospital mortality was 100%. CONCLUSIONS In our study, coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest had 100% in-hospital mortality regardless of the baseline comorbidities, presenting illness severity, and location of arrest.","output":"Is Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Futile in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Experiencing In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Considering the impact of lockdown on older adults, there is a need for some online option to maintain the physical and mental well-being of this vulnerable population in the current pandemic situation.

As health professionals, they can play a key role in strengthening health literacy (HL) of parents on how to prevent chronic allergic diseases in their children. The objective of this study is to explore midwives perspectives regarding HL-sensitive counselling in early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP). Twenty-four qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with midwives, and data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Only a small number of study participants were aware of HL as a concept. However, most of these use screening and counselling strategies which consider individual information needs and which support parental HL. HL sensitivity in counselling is largely based on the midwives gut feelings and counselling experience, rather than on formal education. The midwives were largely aware of evidence-based ECAP recommendations; however, allergy prevention was not seen as a stand-alone topic but as part of their general counselling on infant feeding and hygiene. They found parents to be more open to receiving complex prevention information during antenatal counselling. In order to strengthen midwives roles in HL-sensitive ECAP counselling, their formal education should provide them with explicit HL knowledge and counselling skills. ECAP should be an inherent part of antenatal care.","output":"Health Literacy-Sensitive Counselling on Early Childhood Allergy Prevention: Results of a Qualitative Study on German Midwives Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robust enforcement of tobacco control legislation is helping curb tobacco use in the Russian Federation.

Although hyperglycemia in T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) lead to a series of changes, however, little is known about the alterations of serum proteins in T2DM, especially those proteins with glucose affinity. METHODS In this study, the GlcBPs (glucose binding proteins) of serum were isolated from 30 HV (Health Volunteer) and 30 T2DM patients by GMPC (glucose-magnetic particle conjugates) and identified by mass spectrum analysis. GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) indicated the main gene annotations and pathways of this GlcBPs, while Motif-X webtool provided the potential glucose-binding domains. Further docking analysis and glycan microarray were used to understand the interaction between the glucose and glucose-binding domains. RESULTS A total of 149 and 119 GlcBPs were identified from HV and T2DM cases. 468 GO annotations in 165 identified GlcBPs were available, while the majority involved in cellular processes and binding function. A short peptide, EGDEEITCLNGFWLE, which was derived from the Motif-X analysis, presented a high binding ability to the glucose from both docking analysis and glycan analysis.

Mesh hernia repair became the gold standard because of its low recurrence rate in comparison with non-tension-free repair. Laparoscopic approach seems to have potential advantages over open techniques, including faster recovery and reduced acute and chronic pain rate. Laparoscopic mesh fixation is usually performed using staples, which is associated with higher cost and risk for chronic pain. Recently, the role of mesh fixation has been questioned by several surgeons. AIM To evaluate mesh displacement in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair comparing mesh fixation with no fixation. METHODS From January 2012 to May 2014, 60 consecutive patients with unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized into two groups: control group--10 patients underwent totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with mesh fixation; NO FIX group-50 patients underwent TEP repair with no mesh fixation. Mesh was marked with three 3-mm surgical clips at its medial inferior, medial superior and lateral inferior corners. Mesh displacement was measured by comparing an initial X-ray, performed in the immediate postoperative period, with a second X-ray obtained 30 days later. RESULTS The mean displacement of all three clips in control group was 0.1-0.35 cm (range 0-1.2 cm), while in NO FIX group was 0.1-0.3 cm (range 0-1.3 cm). The overall displacement of control and NO FIX group did not show any difference (p = 0.50). CONCLUSION Fixation of the mesh for TEP repair is unnecessary. TEP repair with no mesh fixation is safe and is not associated with increased risk of mesh displacement.","output":"Prospective, randomized and controlled study of mesh displacement after laparoscopic inguinal repair: fixation versus no fixation of mesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Despite the well-established benefits of exercise, pregnant women are discouraged from physical activity in hot/humid conditions to avoid hyperthermia (core temperature (Tcore)  39.0 C). Recent epidemiological evidence also demonstrates greater risk of negative birth outcomes following heat exposure during pregnancy, possibly due to thermoregulatory impairments. We aimed to determine (1) the risk of pregnant women exceeding a Tcore of 39.0 C during moderate-intensity exercise in the heat; and (2) if any thermoregulatory impairments are evident in pregnant (P) versus non-pregnant (NP) women. METHODS Thirty participants (15 pregnant in their second trimester or third trimester) completed two separate exercise-heat exposures in a climate chamber (32 C, 45%RH). On separate occasions, each participant cycled on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer for 45 min at a workload representative of a moderate-intensity (1) non-weight-bearing (NON-WB), or (2) weight-bearing (WB) activity. Thermoregulatory responses were monitored throughout. RESULTS The highest rectal temperature observed in a pregnant individual was 37.93 C. Mean end-exercise rectal temperature did not differ between groups (P:37.53  0.22 C, NP:37.52  0.34 C, P = 0.954) in the WB trial, but was lower in the P group (P:37.48  0.25 C, vs NP:37.73  0.38 C, P = 0.041) in the NON-WB trial. Whole-body sweat loss was unaltered by pregnancy during WB (P:266  62 g, NP:264  77 g; P = 0.953) and NON-WB P:265  51 g, NP:300  75 g; P = 0.145) exercise. Pregnant participants reported higher ratings of thermal sensation (felt hotter) than their non-pregnant counterparts in the WB trial (P = 0.002) but not in the NON-WB trial, (P = 0.079). CONCLUSION Pregnant women can perform 45 min of moderate-intensity exercise at 32 C, 45%RH with very low apparent risk of excessive maternal hyperthermia.

Plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing besides pathogen reduction procedures, to reduce the virus transmission risk through their products. To achieve a similar safety standard, NAT was then also introduced for labile blood components. German transfusion centres were the first to start in-house NAT testing of their donations in pools of up to 96 samples for HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Years later the diagnostics industry provided commercial HCV and HIV-1 and later HBV NAT tests on automated platforms. NAT tests for HIV-2, hepatitis A virus, and Parvovirus B19 followed, again driven by transfusion centres with their in-house tests. When severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and West Nile Virus emerged it was the NAT that enabled the manufacturers and transfusion centres to instantly introduce sensitive and specific screening tests. Subsequent automation including sample preparation has significantly reduced the costs and complexity of the procedure and made it affordable to middle income countries as well. Currently more than 60 million donations per year are NAT tested worldwide and the remaining residual risk of virus transmission by blood components and products could be reduced to almost zero. Automation rendered possible the reduction of pool size in conjunction with increased throughput and sensitivity. Thus, antibody and antigen testing may be dispensable in the long run, particularly in the combination of NAT testing with pathogen reduction. There are new technologies on the horizon like digital droplet PCR, next-generation sequencing, lab-on-a-chip, and digital antigen assays, which are comparably sensitive. However, each of these has limitations, either in throughput, costs, automation, time to result, specificity, or the need for NAT as an integral part of the technology. Thus, NAT is still the shortest and most efficient means to the result. Donor screening NAT also contributed significantly to our knowledge on how fast viruses replicate, and on the respective diagnostic window. In conjunction with animal and patient studies, we have learned more about the minimal infectious dose and the epidemics in the donor population.","output":"History and Future of Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology Blood Donor Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To determine the benefits associated with brief inpatient rehabilitation for Covid-19 patients. Design Retrospective chart review. Setting A newly created specialized rehabilitation unit in a tertiary care medical center Participants Consecutive sample of the first 100 patients with Covid-19 infection admitted to rehabilitation. Intervention Inpatient rehabilitation for post-acute care Covid-19 patients Main Outcome Measures Measurements, at admission and discharge, comprised a Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (including baseline value before Covid-19 infection), time to perform 10 sit-to-stands with associated cardio-respiratory changes, and grip strength (dynamometry). Correlations between these outcomes and the time spent in ICU were explored. Results Patient characteristics upon admission to rehabilitation were: men 66%, age 6622 years, mean delay from symptom onset 20.410.0 days, BMI 26.05.4 kg/m2, hypertension 49%, diabetes 29%, with 26% having >50% pulmonary damage on CT-scans. Mean length of rehabilitation stay was 9.85.6 days. From admission to discharge, the Barthel index (/100) increased from 77.326.7 to 88.824.5 (p<0.001), without recovering baseline values (94.516.2; p<0.001). There was a 37% improvement in sit-to-stand frequency (0.270.16 to 0.370.16 Hz; p<0.001), a 13% decrease in post-test respiratory rate (30.712.6 to 26.66.1; p=0.03), and a 15% increase in grip strength (18.19.2 to 20.98.9 kg; p<0.001). At both admission and discharge, Barthel score correlated with grip strength (rho=0.39-0.66; p<0.01), which negatively correlated with time spent in ICU (rho=-0.57 to -0.49, p<0.05). Conclusions Inpatient rehabilitation for Covid-19 patients was associated with substantial motor, respiratory and functional improvement, especially in severe cases, even though there remained mild persistent autonomy loss upon discharge. Following acute stages, Covid-19, primarily a respiratory disease, might convert into a motor impairment correlated with the time spent in intensive care.","output":"Do Patients with Covid-19 Benefit from Rehabilitation?

Such patients are at greater risk of severe SARS-CoV infection. Our purpose was to assess the parameters of cellular immunity in patients with lymphomas with a history of multi-course chemotherapy, therapy with anti-CD20+ antibodies and PCRconfirmed COVID19. Methods: The study included 12 adult patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (non-Hodgkin's large B-cell lymphomas (NHL) -7, Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) -5) with a history of PCRconfirmed COVID-19. All patients underwent 4 to 6 chemotherapy cycles. The relative numbers of the main populations of leukocytes, T-and Blymphocytes, as well as subpopulations of Tlymphocytes, were assessed in the whole blood collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer with a panel of antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Becton Dickinson, USA). Results: Patients with HL showed a number of changes in the parameters of cellular immunity. The content of total lymphocytes and monocytes was reduced in comparison with patients with NHL by 34% and 56%, respectively: 14.3 (11;17) vs. 21.7 (15.2;32), and 6.0 (4.8;7.1) vs. 13.5 (12.9;13.7), respectively. An increase in granulocytes by 30% was revealed in patients with HL. No differences were found in the content of both general and main populations (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, central and effector memory cells). However, the content of naive CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with HL increased by 43% and 62%, respectively. While the number of CD3+CD4-CD8-lymphocytes was 47% lower, the number of CD3+CD4+CD8+, on the contrary, exceeded the values in patients with NHL by 4.6 times. Patients with HL also showed a tendency towards a decrease in the number of NK and NKT-lymphocytes. Conclusions: The increased levels of naive lymphocytes and both populations of memory cells and a sharp increase in double-negative T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes in patients with HL could indicate certain characteristics of the disease course affected by COVID-19.

METHODS: Using case log data prospectively collected by a Stroke Team exclusively serving &#8776;2 million inhabitants and 30 healthcare facilities, we retrospectively reviewed volumes of consultations and reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke. We compared volumes before and after announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the prior calendar year.

METHODS: Blood samples collected for clinical testing and then discarded (\\"spent samples\\") were obtained from the clinical laboratory of a medical center in Atlanta. A convenience sample of spent samples from both inpatients (medical/surgical floors, intensive care, obstetrics) and outpatients (clinics and ambulatory surgery) were collected one day per week from January-March 2021. Samples were matched to clinical data from the electronic medical record. In-house single dilution serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) antibodies were developed and validated using pre-pandemic and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient serum and plasma samples (Figure 1). ELISA optical density (OD) cutoffs for seroconversion were chosen using receiver operating characteristic analysis with areas under the curve for all four assays greater than 0.95 after 14 days post symptom onset. IgG profiles were defined as natural infection (RBD and N positive) or vaccinated (RBD positive, N negative). Figure 1.

OBJECTIVE To describe how and to what extent the lockdown caused by the first wave of COVID-19 influenced the domestic violence in Val Camonica. METHOD Using the informatic system of the Esine Emergency Department, accesses for domestic, psychological and/or physical violence in the years 2017-2020 were analyzed. RESULTS In 2020, following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the observed accesses for domestic violence and aggressions displayed during violent episodes was. As in previous years, women victims of domestic violence were between 30 and 40 years old and of Italian nationality; men were also victims of domestic violence. CONCLUSIONS Also in Val Camonica violence against women is a widespread phenomenon. For this reason the Valcamonica local Authorities are taking action to expand the available network service.","output":"[Domestic violence in Val Camonica: survey on the accesses to the emergency deparment in the period post Covid-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Surgery can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. However, some patients are at a later stage at diagnosis and need to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Previous studies have shown that NACT may lead to more postoperative complications. Probiotics have the potential to reduce postoperative complications and infections, but no similar clinical trials have been conducted in patients with gastric cancer receiving NACT. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotics on postoperative infections and other short-term outcomes in patients with gastric cancer receiving NACT. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. All patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery after NACT were included and randomized into a probiotic group (PG; n = 33) or a control group (CG; n = 33). Postoperative infectious complications, recovery of gastrointestinal function, postoperative hospital stay, medical costs, time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy, 30-d readmission and mortality, and common laboratory inflammatory indexes were observed. RESULTS: PG patients had significantly fewer postoperative infections (P = 0.027). Time to first flatus and bowel movement was quicker (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) and inflammatory indexes were lower in the PG patients. Postoperative hospital length of stay was shorter in the PG than in the CG (P = 0.001). Due to fewer postoperative infections and faster recovery, adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated earlier in PG patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative probiotic supplements can reduce postoperative infection, improve short-term clinical outcomes, and reduce the level of common inflammatory indicators in patients with gastric cancer receiving NACT. Patients in the PG started adjuvant chemotherapy earlier than CG patients.","output":"Effect of perioperative probiotic supplements on postoperative short-term outcomes in gastric cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates severe progression of COVID-19 and becomes evident by coronary artery calcification (CAC) on low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT). The purpose of this study was to predict a patients obligation of intensive care treatment by evaluating the coronary calcium burden on the initial diagnostic LDCT. METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with parallel LDCT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included from three centers. The primary endpoint was admission to ICU, tracheal intubation, or death in the 22-day follow-up period. CAC burden was represented by the Agatston score. Multivariate logistic regression was modeled for prediction of the primary endpoint by the independent variables Agatston score > 0, as well as the CT lung involvement score, patient sex, age, clinical predictors of severe COVID-19 progression (history of hypertension, diabetes, prior cardiovascular event, active smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and laboratory parameters (creatinine, C-reactive protein, leucocyte, as well as thrombocyte counts, relative lymphocyte count, d-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels). RESULTS: After excluding multicollinearity, Agatston score >0 was an independent regressor within multivariate analysis for prediction of the primary endpoint (p<0.01). Further independent regressors were creatinine (p = 0.02) and leucocyte count (p = 0.04). The Agatston score was significantly higher for COVID-19 cases which completed the primary endpoint (64.2 [interquartile range 1.7C409.4] vs. 0 [interquartile range 0C0]). CONCLUSION: CAC scoring on LDCT might help to predict future obligation of intensive care treatment at the day of patient admission to the hospital.","output":"Coronary artery calcification on low-dose chest CT is an early predictor of severe progression of COVID-19A multi-center, multi-vendor study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal outcomes and its association with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes has been reported; however, a detailed understanding of the effect of maternal positivity, delivery mode and perinatal practices on fetal and neonatal outcomes is urgently needed. Objective To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on fetal and neonatal outcomes and the role of the mode of delivery, breastfeeding and early neonatal care practices on the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Study Design In this cohort study that took place from March 2020 to March 2021, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-exposed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. COVID-19 in pregnancy was determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. The outcome measures were indices of neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, neonatal positivity and its correlation with mode of delivery, breastfeeding and hospital neonatal care practices. Results A total of 586 neonates born to women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1535 neonates born to women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis had a higher rate of cesarean section (52.8% compared to 38.5% for those without COVID-19 diagnosis, p<0.01) and pregnancy related complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal distress, all with p-value < 0.001, compared to women without COVID-19 diagnosis. Maternal diagnosis of COVID-19 carried an increased rate of preterm birth (p 0.001) and lower neonatal weight (p 0.001), length, and head circumference at birth. In mothers with COVID-19 diagnosis, the length of in-utero exposure was significantly correlated to the risk of the neonate testing positive (OR, 4.5; 95% CI 2.2-9.4 for length of in-utero exposure > 14 days). Among neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 diagnosis, birth via cesarean section was a risk factor for them testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7), even when severity of maternal conditions was considered and after multivariable logistic analysis. In the subgroup of neonates born to women with COVID-19 diagnosis, the outcomes worsened when the neonate also tested positive, with higher rates of Intensive Care Unit admission, fever, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and death, even after adjusting for prematurity. Breastfeeding by mothers with COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as hospital neonatal care practices including immediate skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in, were not associated with an increased risk of newborn positivity. Conclusions In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with increased maternal and neonatal complications. Cesarean section was significantly associated with newborn COVID-19 diagnosis. Vaginal delivery should be considered the safest mode of delivery if obstetrical and health conditions allow it. Mother to child skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in and direct breastfeeding did not represent risk factors for newborn COVID-19 diagnosis, thus well-established best practices can be continued among women with COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Effects of prenatal exposure to maternal COVID-19 and perinatal care on neonatal outcome: results from the INTERCOVID Multinational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"÷ᰣϹȥһֱȱ͹ݣǿMRIܰͻˮӦʹٴȷ÷ᰣΪܡǿMRI÷ᰣܰͻˮоػٴԼüӦö÷ᰣٴоӰ죬ڶܰͻˮŶԱȼͶŵķע䷨;ע䷨ǰҩӹҾԲǻʹԲĤԼѪҺSchwalbeѪͨڶܰǻ϶ͼɼһû3TŹǵάҺ˥תָ3D-FLAIRУͼؽʵݻؽ㷨עͶЧϺãٴȺ㷺ԲҪϸߣעŶԱȼĲ㣬ڶǿЧǷѣǱڵ඾ã๦ܲ޷ܸü顣ܰͻˮ̶ȵ붨ĸֵ̬ѧжа붨ڽϴ̬ѧжʹýΪ㣬ǣǰҪųǱڵļ⵼µļԡڱµ̬ѧжнϴĽٴӦЧдһ֤ǿMRIܰͻˮоٽ˹÷ᰣٴˮƽߡ.","output":"[Technology and clinical application of detecting endolymphatic hydrops in Meniere's disease using gadolinium-enhanced MRI]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While reduced exposure to prescription opioids may decrease risks, including overdose and opioid use disorder, abrupt tapering or discontinuation may pose new risks. OBJECTIVES: To examine potentially unsafe tapering and discontinuation among dosage changes in opioid prescriptions dispensed to US patients on high-dose long-term opioid therapy. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study of adults (18 years) on stable high-dose (50 oral morphine milligram equivalents [MME] daily dosage) long-term opioid therapy during a 180-day baseline and a 360-day follow-up using all-payer pharmaceutical claims data, 2017-2019. MEASURES: Dosage tapering, increases, and/or stability during follow-up; sustained dosage stability, reductions, or discontinuation at the end of follow-up; and tapering rate. Patients could experience more than one outcome during follow-up. RESULTS: Among 595,078 patients receiving high-dose long-term opioid therapy in the sample, 26.7% experienced sustained dosage reductions and 9.3% experienced discontinuation. Among patients experiencing tapering, 62.0% experienced maximum taper rates between > 10-40% reductions per month and 36.1% experienced monthly rates  40%. Among patients with mean baseline daily dosages  150 MME, 47.7% experienced a maximum taper rate  40% per month. Relative to baseline, 19.7% of patients experiencing tapering had long-term dosage reductions  40% per month at the end of follow-up. IMPLICATIONS: Dosage changes for patients on high-dose long-term opioid therapy may warrant special attention, particularly over shorter intervals, to understand how potentially sudden tapering and discontinuation can be reduced while emphasizing patient safety and shared decision-making. Rapid discontinuation of opioids can increase risk of adverse outcomes including opioid withdrawal.","output":"Dose tapering, increases, and discontinuity among patients on long-term high-dose opioid therapy in the United States, 2017-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being declared a global emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives, threatened livelihoods and businesses around the world The energy industry, in particular, has experienced tremendous pressure resulting from the pandemic In response to such a challenge, the development of sustainable resources and renewable energy infrastructure has demonstrated its potential as a promising and effective strategy To sufficiently address the effect of COVID-19 on renewable energy development strategies, short-term policy priorities should be identified, while mid-term and long-term action plans should be formulated in achieving the well-defined renewable energy targets and progress towards a more sustainable energy future In this review, opportunities, challenges, and significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on current and future sustainable energy strategies were analyzed in detail;while drawing from experiences in identifying reasonable behaviors, orientating appropriate actions, and policy implications on the sustainable energy trajectory were also mentioned Indeed, the question is that whether the COVID-19 pandemic will kill us or provide us with a precious lesson on future sustainable energy development ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy system and the shift progress to renewable energy: Opportunities, challenges, and policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is an important component of epidemic response.

Here, using data from Sierra Leone, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen's incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both empirically and in our simulations.

The diagnosis of the cases was confirmed according to the WHO interim guidance. The data of consecutive severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to these hospitals were analyzed. A total of 566 patients from the Peoples Hospital of Wuhan University were included in the training cohort and 436 patients from Leishenshan Hospital were included in the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression were used to select the variables and build the mortality risk prediction model. RESULTS: The prediction model was resented as a nomograph and developed based on identified predictors, including age, chronic lung disease, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), creatine, and total bilirubin. In the training cohort, the model displayed good discrimination with an AUC of 0.912 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884C0.940] and good calibration (intercept = 0; slope = 1).

Humans consume CQAs in mg-to-gram quantities through dietary consumption of plant products. CQAs are considered beneficial for human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, new biosynthetic pathways via a peroxidase-type p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase enzyme were discovered. More recently, a new GDSL lipase-like enzyme able to transform mono-caffeoylquinic acids into di-caffeoylquinic acid was identified in Ipomoea batatas. CQAs were recently linked to memory improvement; they seem to be strong indirect antioxidants via Nrf2 activation. However, there is a prevalent confusion in the designation and nomenclature of different CQAs isomers. Such inconsistencies are critical and complicate bioactivity assessment since different isomers differ in bioactivity and potency. A detailed explanation regarding the origin of such confusion is provided, and a recommendation to unify nomenclature is suggested. Furthermore, for studies on CQA bioactivity, plant-based laboratory animal diets contain CQAs, which makes it difficult to include proper control groups for comparison. Therefore, a synthetic diet free of CQAs is advised to avoid interferences since some CQAs may produce bioactivity even at nanomolar levels. Biotransformation of CQAs by gut microbiota, the discovery of new enzymatic biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, dietary assessment, and assessment of biological properties with potential for drug development are areas of active, ongoing research.

Autophagy is a major cellular defense against oxidative stress, or related conditions that cause accumulation of damaged proteins or organelles. Selective forms of autophagy can maintain organelle populations or remove aggregated proteins. Dysregulation of redox homeostasis under pathological conditions results in excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and the associated oxidative damage of cellular components. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is necessary to maintain redox homeostasis. ROS activates autophagy, which facilitates cellular adaptation and diminishes oxidative damage by degrading and recycling intracellular damaged macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles. The cellular responses triggered by oxidative stress include the altered regulation of signaling pathways that culminate in the regulation of autophagy. Current research suggests a central role for autophagy as a mammalian oxidative stress response and its interrelationship to other stress defense systems. Altered autophagy phenotypes have been observed in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease, acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and asthma. Understanding the mechanisms by which ROS regulate autophagy will provide novel therapeutic targets for lung diseases.

We aimed to determine patient satisfaction, perceived barriers, as well as indications for teledermatology appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A survey was sent out via SurveyMonkey's online platform to patients of the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates' Dermatology department who attended telehealth appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Out of 894 invitations sent, 168 patients completed our survey.The most common reasons for making a telehealth appointment were for a new rash (11.6%), eczema (9.8%), and psoriasis (9.1%). The most common reasons respondents liked telehealth were because of time efficiency (81.1%), not requiring transportation (74.2%), and maintaining social distancing (73.6%). The most common reasons respondents did not like telehealth were due to lack of physical touch (26.8%) and feeling they received an inadequate assessment (15.7%). Very few patients reported that they were unlikely to undertake another telehealth visit (9.94%) or recommend a telehealth visit to others (6.92%). CONCLUSION Dermatology patients likely perceive telehealth visits as a convenient and safe method for quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of physical touch, inability to provide close inspection and/or procedural intervention can be frustrating for patients and therefore meaningful selection of appropriate cases for telehealth visits can optimize the patient experience. Overall, telemedicine represents an effective and safe vehicle for delivering care especially during a global pandemic.

The overall population was divided into two groups: group 1 included 10 patients who presented with a clinical picture of COVID-19 infection and were isolated, and group 2 included 25 patients who were COVID-19-negative. In group 1, nine patients were on chronic oral anticoagulant therapy and one patient was on acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel. A chest computed tomography scan revealed interstitial pneumonia in all 10 patients. RESULTS During hospitalization, COVID-19 patients received azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in addition to their ongoing therapy.

RESULTS Out of 1 467 975 children enrolled in the ZM-EIR in Sindh, 10.6% (154 881/1 467 975) were zero dose. There were sharp inequities across the 27 districts. Zero dose children had a lower proportion of hospital births (28.5% vs 34.0%; difference 5.5 percentage points (pp) (95% CI 5.26 to 5.74); p<0.001) and higher prevalence from slums (49.5% vs 42.3%; difference 7.2 pp (95% CI 6.93 to 7.46); p<0.001), compared with non-zero dose children. Children residing in urban compared with rural areas were at a higher risk (relative risk (RR): 1.20; p<0.001; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.22), while children with educated compared with uneducated mothers were at a lower risk of being zero dose (RR: 0.47-0.96; p<0.001; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98).

No patients who underwent LsTG, LPG or LTG had metastases in station no. 2 or 4sa lymph node. The 3-year OS and RFS rates of patients for whom each procedure was planned were not different. CONCLUSIONS LsTG could be an oncologically acceptable procedure for cT1N0M0 gastric cancer in the upper gastric body.

OBJECTIVES: This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on people identified as at high risk of severe illness by UK Government, and in particular, the impact of the first lockdown on access to healthcare, medications and use of technological platforms. METHODS: 1038 UK adults who identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 in line with UK Government guidance or self-identified with acute or other chronic health conditions, completed the Awareness, Attitudes and Actions survey which explored the impact of COVID-19 on access to healthcare, management of long-term health condition, mental health, and health behaviours. RESULTS: Most participants reported feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and isolation, noticed that other people changed their behaviour towards them including a feeling of being stigmatised by people not categorised as high risk. Participants described the largely negative impact that the COVID-19 lockdown had on to health-related behaviours and access to healthcare, which had resulted in large declines in mental health and wellbeing. Participants also indicated disappointment at the UK Governments response and handling of the COVID-19 lockdown. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides novel evidence of the lived experience of the first COVID-19 lockdown for people identified as at high risk of severe illness. In the context of behavioural health interventions, the ubiquity of digital technologies and their adoption into day-to-day life translates into greater potential reach than traditional interventions, and consequently, greater potential for positive public health impact. Findings should be considered by policymakers and healthcare professionals to support people now and as we transition through the recovery phase with a particular emphasis on supporting mental health and changes to the management of long-term health conditions.","output":"Exploring the awareness, attitudes, and actions (AAA) of UK adults at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CoViD-19 pandemic has changed the concept of clinic and doctor-patient relationship.

Immune checkpoint molecules expressed on CD4(+) T cells play critical roles in chronic HBV infection. However, their roles in chronic asymptomatic HBV carriers (ASCs) with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative remain unclear. In this study, we explored the role of immune checkpoint molecules expressed on CD4(+) T cell subsets in chronic ASCs with HBeAg-negative. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the ASCs with HBeAg-negative and healthy controls (HC) were isolated, and immune checkpoint molecules expressed on CD4(+) T cell subsets and serum cytokines were detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, the mRNA expressions of immune checkpoint molecules were analyzed by a real-time quantitative PCR assay. RESULTS: In comparison with HC, CD4(+) T cells highly expressed LAG-3, TIM-3, and PD-1 in PBMCs from chronic ASCs with HBeAg-negative. Interestingly, the expressions of TIM-3 and PD-1 on circulating follicular helper T (Tfh) cells in ASCs were significantly high. Moreover, high expressions of LAG-3, TIM-3, and PD-1 were different among Treg, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. In addition, the expressions of TIM-3 and CTLA-4 mRNA in PBMCs from ASCs were significantly elevated. However, the frequency of CTLA-4(+)CD4(+) T cell subsets in PBMCs from ASCs was not different from HC. The levels of six cytokines in serum from ASCs were not clearly different from HC.

An understanding of evidence synthesis is important for people to make truly informed healthcare decisions. There is an increasing focus on the use of knowledge translation resources within healthcare; however, the development of these resources has often been poorly described or studied. Objectives: This study employs a user-centred approach to develop a video animation resource to explain the purpose, use and importance of evidence synthesis to the general public regarding healthcare decision-making. Methods: We employed a user-centred approach to developing a spoken animated video that could explain evidence synthesis to a public audience, conducting several cycles of idea generation, prototyping, user-testing, analysis and refinement. Six researchers with expertise in evidence synthesis and knowledge translation resource development gave input on the key messages of the video animation and informed the first draft of the storyboard and script. Seven members of the public provided feedback on this draft through Think-aloud interviews, which we used to develop a video animation prototype. Seven additional members of the public participated in Think-aloud interviews while watching the video prototype. In addition to interviews, participants completed a questionnaire that collected data on perceived usefulness, desirability, clarity and credibility. One experienced patient and public involvement (PPI) advocate also provided feedback on the script and prototype. At the end of each feedback cycle, we assimilated all data and made necessary changes, resulting in a final, rendered version of the animation video. Results: Researchers identified the initial key messages for the SAV as 1) the importance of evidence synthesis, 2) what an evidence synthesis is and 3) how evidence synthesis can impact healthcare decision-making. Using guidance and feedback from members of the public, we produced a three-and-a-half-minute video animation that members of the public rated 9/10 for usefulness, 8/10 for desirability, 8/10 for clarity and 9/10 for credibility. The video was uploaded on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZR0xQmZVQg) and has been viewed over 5500 times to date. Conclusions: Employing a user-centred approach, we developed a video animation knowledge translation resource to explain evidence synthesis to the general public that was assessed as useful, desirable and clear by its intended target audience.

Our objective is to describe the changes in the blood transcriptome and explore the potential mechanisms associated with vitamin D3 supplementation in one hundred vitamin D-deficient women who were given a weekly oral dose (50,000 IU) of vitamin D3 for three months. A high-throughput targeted PCR, composed of 264 genes representing the important blood transcriptomic fingerprints of health and disease states, was performed on pre and post-supplementation blood samples to profile the molecular response to vitamin D3. We identified 54 differentially expressed genes that were strongly modulated by vitamin D3 supplementation. Network analyses showed significant changes in the immune-related pathways such as TLR4/CD14 and IFN receptors, and catabolic processes related to NF-kB, which were subsequently confirmed by gene ontology enrichment analyses. We proposed a model for vitamin D3 response based on the expression changes of molecules involved in the receptor-mediated intra-cellular signaling pathways and the ensuing predicted effects on cytokine production. Overall, vitamin D3 has a strong effect on the immune system, G-coupled protein receptor signaling, and the ubiquitin system.

One possible aspect of these observations that has yet to be explored in detail is what role arthropods that have been associated with human skin infestation, such as Demodecidae or Pyemotidae species, play in viral transmission. It seems likely that arthropod-coronavirus interactions may take place through the molecular attraction forces between the chitin found on the exoskeleton of mites commonly found on human skin and the lipids present on the viral envelope of the SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this study is to analyse plasma levels of sTNFR 1 and 2 in association with organ failure and outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: After informed consent, we included 122 adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at ICU admission. Demographic data, illness severity scores, organ failure and survival at 30 days were collected. Plasma sTNFR 1 and 2 levels were quantified during the first days after ICU admission. Twenty-five healthy blood donors were used as control group. RESULTS: Levels of sTNFR were higher in severe COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Plasma levels of sTNFR were associated to illness severity scores (SAPS 3 and SOFA), inflammation biomarkers such as IL-6, ferritin and PCT as well as development of AKI during ICU stay. sTNFR 1 higher than 2.29 ng/mL and? sTNFR 2 higher than 11.7 ng/mL were identified as optimal cut-offs to discriminate survivors and non-survivors 30 days after ICU admission and had an area under the curve in receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 and 0.67 respectively.

After ICU-discharge patients and family members can suffer from persisting impairments known as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family. Since COVID-19 is relatively new, there is barely any knowledge on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members. OBJECTIVES This study aims to gain insight in the long-term physical, social and psychological functioning of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members at three- and six-months following ICU discharge. METHODS A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted in COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members. Enrolled participants received questionnaires at three and six months after ICU discharge. The MOS Short-Form General Health Survey, Clinical Frailty Scale, spirometry tests, McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD-GF6+), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and return to work were used to evaluate physical, social and psychological functioning. RESULTS Sixty COVID-19 ICU-survivors and 78 family members participated. Physical functioning was impaired in ICU-survivors as reflected by a score of 33.3 (IQR 16.7-66.7) and 50 (IQR 16.7-83.3) on the physical functioning subscale at 3- and 6-months follow-up respectively. Diffusion lung capacity was reduced in 69% of patients. Ninety percent of the ICU-survivors reported persistent symptoms after 6 months. Social functioning was impaired as 90% of the COVID-19 ICU-survivors did not reach their pre-ICU employment level, 6 months after ICU-discharge. Psychological functioning in ICU-survivors was normal. Family members experienced worse employment status in 35% and 34% including a decrease in employment rate of 18.3% and 7.4% at 3- and 6-months post ICU-discharge, respectively. Psychologically, 63% of the family members reported ongoing impaired well-being due to the COVID-19 related mandatory physical distance to their relatives. CONCLUSION We have shown that COVID-19 ICU-survivors suffer from a prolonged burden of disease, prominent in physical- and social functioning, worse employment status and persisting symptoms in 90%. In addition, family members also report long term effects expressed by a reduction in return to work and impaired well-being.

The dose level 5.0 kGy showed highest the content of crude protein (24.42, 19.41 and 13.50 mg/100 g), as well as crude fiber (34.26 and 21.18 mg/100 g) for ML, GL and GS, respectively. Mulberry leaves has a highest content of protein and fiber at dose 5.0 kGy compared with GL and GS. The highest total phenolic content was found in GS (9.75 mg/g DW), followed by GL (7.32 mg/g DW) and the lowest in ML (5.97 mg/g DW). While ML had a higher total flavonoids content (5.61 mg/g DW) than GS (4.88 mg/g DW) and GL (2.86 mg/g DW). Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were significantly increased at 5.0 kGy. The highest level (83.25% and 80.24%) of scavenging activity (DPPH %) and inhibition activity of HCT 116 cells was recorded at 5.0 kGy by GS.

Infection of susceptible SJL mice with this virus serves as an excellent model of virus-induced demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). iNOS transcripts and protein were detected in brains and spinal cords of TMEV-infected SJL mice during early acute disease, which resembles polioencephalomyelitis. Similar level of expression of iNOS has been found in resistant B6 mice, which develop only early acute disease. Weak iNOS staining was detected in reactive astrocytes and in leptomeningeal infiltrates in TMEV-infected SJL mice at 42 days post infection (p.i.), corresponding to early phase of chronic demyelinating disease, but not at 66 and 180 days p.i. corresponding to advanced and terminal stages of the disease, respectively. Results from other laboratories demonstrated that, blocking of NO by treatment of TMEV-infected SJL mice with amino guanidine (AG), a specific inhibitor of NO resulted in delay of late chronic demyelinating disease. However this protective effect of NO inhibitor depended on the temporal phase of the disease, type of cells expressing iNOS and the time of administration of AG. The results from our laboratory suggests that NO expressed during early acute disease is beneficial to the host through induction of apoptosis of infiltrating T cells and resolution of encephalitis, but its role in myelin/oligodendrocytes damage during late chronic demyelinating disease is not clear and it may depend on availability of superoxide and formation of peroxynitrite.","output":"Nitric Oxide in TMEV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and nootropic drugs in the reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms in post-stroke patients.

Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scales. Statistical associations between the use of nootropic drugs and mood disorder improvements were determined by measuring assessment scores at 6-months. RESULTS: A total of 44 post-stroke patients with depression (aged 45C75 years) were enrolled in the study: 20 were treated with SSRIs and 24 received nootropic drugs. From baseline to follow-up, the SSRI group showed a large effect size with regard depression (success rate difference [SRD] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21, 0.79) and anxiety (SRD 0.49; 95% CI 0.14, 0.74), whereas the nootropic group showed a small effect size for depression (SRD 0.16; 95% CI C0.17, 0.46) and a small effect size for anxiety (SRD 0.36; 95% CI C0.03, 0.62).

On top of traditional VTE risk factors encountered during COVID-19 such as prolonged bed rest, hypoxemia and intravascular material, main features of patients with severe forms (old age, obesity) explain in part the VTE frequency. In addition, COVID-19 causes an endothelial disease following endotheliitis after the direct invasion of endothelial cells and a prothrombotic state secondary to the strong inflammatory response to infection. Altogether, these mechanisms lead to an extensive immunothrombosis within the pulmonary vasculature.

Here we report the genomic characterization and phylogenetic evolution of this coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 that caused COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other coronaviruses were obtained from GISAID and GenBank. Then the genome was annotated, and potential genetic recombination was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted and used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help deduce the origin of virus. An annotation has revealed SARS-CoV-2 possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SARS-like-CoV collected in China. The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were very similar, showing 99.6-100% sequence identity. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to bat-SARS-like coronavirus, but was more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic tree of the complete viral genome showed that the virus clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus. The results of the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses did not identify any potential genomic recombination events. Therefore, it seems like that the SARS-CoV-2 might be originally hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts of currently unknown wild animal(s).

To avoid insufficient sample utilization in existing methods limited by few fully-observed samples, we propose to measure distribution distance with the optimal transport for reconstruction evaluation instead of traditional pixel-wise loss function. Moreover, the clustering loss of the latent feature is introduced to regularize the embedding with more discrimination capability. As a consequence, the network becomes more robust against missing features and the unified framework which combines clustering and sample imputation enables the two procedures to negotiate to better serve for each other.

Chest radiography through glass walls of an isolation room is a technique that could be immensely useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to ensure quality and radiation safety while acquiring portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms using an adult anthropomorphic thorax phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen chest radiographs were acquired utilizing different exposure factors without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Images were scored independently by 2 radiologists for quantum mottle and sharpness of anatomical structures using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistically significant differences in Likert scale scores and entrance surface dose (ESD) between images acquired without glass and through the smart and regular glass were tested. Interreader reliability was also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with conventional radiography, equal or higher mean image quality scores (mottle and anatomical structures) were observed with the smart glass using 100 kVp at 12 mAs and 20 mAs and 125 kVp at 6.3 mAs (100 kVp at 2 mAs and 125 kVp at 3.2 mAs were used for conventional radiography observations). There was no statistically significant difference in the Likert scale scores for image quality and the entrance surface dose for radiographs acquired without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Backscatter from the smart glass was minimal at a distance of 3 m and was recorded as zero at a distance of 4 m from the x-ray tube outside an isolation room. CONCLUSIONS: Good-quality portable chest radiographs can be obtained safely through the smart glass doors of the isolation room. However, this technique does result in minor backscatter radiation.

Overall obesity has recently been established as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of fat distribution and especially that of visceral fat, which is often associated with metabolic syndrome, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the association between fat distribution and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 and a mean age of 65.6  13.1 years from a level-one medical center in Berlin, Germany, were included in the present cross-sectional analysis. COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasal and throat swabs. A severe clinical course of COVID-19 was defined by hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation. Fat was measured at the level of the first lumbar vertebra on routinely acquired low-dose chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: An increase in visceral fat area (VFA) by ten square centimeters was associated with a 1.37-fold higher likelihood of ICU treatment and a 1.32-fold higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation (adjusted for age and sex). For upper abdominal circumference, each additional centimeter of circumference was associated with a 1.13-fold higher likelihood of ICU treatment and a 1.25-fold higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept study suggests that visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference specifically increase the likelihood of COVID-19 severity. CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference in routine chest CTs may therefore be a simple tool for risk assessment in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The role of visceral adiposity in the severity of COVID-19: highlights from a unicenter cross-sectional pilot study in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study showing that Alcoholics Anonymous as as effective, or more effective, than psychotherapy (see ?Research: AA is better pathway to abstinence than psychotherapy,?

This study aimed to assess the differences in adopting preventive behaviours among populations to explore potential individual and household factors and inequalities within families. METHODS: This online survey was conducted in April 2020. The directional stratified convenient sampling method was used to select 4704 participants from eight provinces in eastern, central, and western China. The questionnaire included demographic information, household variables, and five target prevention behaviours. The chi-squared test, binary multilevel model, and MantelCHaenszel hierarchical analysis were used for data analysis in the study. RESULTS: Approximately 71.2% of the participants had appropriate outdoor prevention, and 32.9% of the participants had indoor protection in place. Sharing behaviours (P < 0.001) and education level (P < 0.001) were positively associated with adopting preventive measures. The inhibiting effect of household crowding and stimulating effect of high household income on preventive behaviours were determined in this study. Household size was negatively associated with living area ( = -0.057, P < 0.05) and living style ( = -0.077, P < 0.05). Household income was positively associated with age ( = 0.023, P < 0.05), and relationship with friends ( = 0.053, P < 0.05). Vulnerable groups, such as older adults or women, are more likely to have inadequate preventive behaviours. Older adults (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.09C2.15), women (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15C1.64), and those with more than 2 suspected symptoms (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.07C3.19) were more likely to be affected by the inhibiting effect of household crowding, while the stimulating effect of high household income was limited in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in COVID-19 prevention behaviours exist between families and inadequate adoption of prevention by vulnerable groups are noteworthy. This study expands the research perspective by emphasizing the role of household factors in preventive behaviours and by focusing on family inequalities. The government should use traditional media as a platform to enhance residents public health knowledge. Targeted additional wage subsidies, investments in affordable housing, financial support for multigenerational households, and temporary relocation policies may deserve more attention. Communities could play a critical role in COVID-19 prevention.

Methods: US adult HT and LT recipients completed their vaccine series between January 7 and April 10, 2021. Reactogencity and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody were assessed after a priming dose (D1) and booster dose (D2). Modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimator was used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and antibody development. Results: Of 134 heart recipients, there were 38% non-responders (D1-/D2-), 48% booster responders (D1-/D2+), and 14% priming dose responders (D1+/D2+). Of 103 lung recipients, 64% were non-responders, 27% were booster responders, and 9% were priming dose responders. Lung recipients were less likely to develop antibodies (p<0.001). Priming dose antibody response was associated with younger recipient age (p=0.04), transplant-to-vaccination time  6 years (p<0.01), and lack of anti-metabolite maintenance immunosuppression (p<0.001). Pain at injection site was the most commonly reported reaction (85% after D1, 76% after D2). Serious reactions were rare, the most common being fatigue (2% after D1 and 3% after D2). No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: HT and LT recipients experienced diminished antibody response following vaccination; reactogenicity was comparable to that of the general population. LT recipients may exhibit a more impaired antibody response than HT recipients. While current recommendations are to vaccinate eligible candidates and recipients, further studies characterizing the cell-mediated immune response and clinical efficacy of these vaccines in this population are needed.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA Vaccine Antibody Response and Reactogenicity in Heart and Lung Transplant Recipients: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response in heart and lung recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the more routine public health measures, many countries have implemented lockdownsclosing borders, restricting international travel, and placing severe limitations on individual movement and group gatherings. While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from nonCCOVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries.

Aluminium chloride induces AD like pathology in rats. Renin angiotensin system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we evaluated and compared the effect of Captopril and Perindopril against aluminium chloride induced amyloidogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in rats. Wistar rats of both sex were divided randomly into four groups i.e. Group I was served as normal control and treated with normal saline, Group II was administered with AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, p. o.) and Group III and IV received Captopril (30 mg/kg, p. o.) and Perindopril (5 mg/kg, p. o.) respectively 1hr prior to administration of AlCl3. All the doses were given once daily for 42 days. The evaluation of memory function was carried out in Y-maze (spontaneous alternation), radial arm maze (number of correct responses) and elevated plus maze (transfer latency). After behavioral studies, estimation of antioxidant status (brain and serum), amyloid-? content (brain) and histopathology of brain hippocampus region was done. Administration of AlCl3 for 42 days impaired cognitive dysfunction. Captopril and Perindopril prevented AlCl3 induced cognitive dysfunction by improving spontaneous alternation behavior, number of correct responses and reducing transfer latency. They also increase the antioxidant status, reduce the A?42 content in the brain and reverse the histopathological changes caused by AlCl3 in hippocampal region.

We aimed to understand ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among hospital healthcare workers depending on their hospital role, socioeconomic status, Covid-19 symptoms and basic demographics. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal observational cohort study. 1364 HCWs at five UK hospitals were studied with up to 16 weeks of symptom questionnaires and antibody testing (to both nucleocapsid and spike protein) during the first UK wave in five NHS hospitals between March 20 and July 10 2020. The main outcome measures were SARS-CoV-2 infection (seropositivity at any time-point) and symptoms. Registration number: NCT04318314. FINDINGS: 272 of 1364 HCWs (mean age 40.7 years, 72% female, 74% White, 6 samples per participant) seroconverted, reporting predominantly mild or no symptoms. Seropositivity was lower in Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) workers (OR=0.44 95%CI 0.24, 0.77; p=0.0035). Seropositivity was higher in Black (compared to White) participants, independent of age, sex, role and index of multiple deprivation (OR=2.61 95%CI 1.47-4.62 p=0.0009).

We find that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging Fc?3 receptors decay over time, with S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declining accordingly. Although there is significant decay in ADCC and ADP activity, they remain readily detectable in almost all subjects at the last timepoint studied (94%) in contrast with neutralisation activity (70%).

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. METHODS: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to February 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios to simulate the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: We find that in the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between December 2019 and early January 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 1-8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, infections were likely in the thousands. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Reduced transmissibility resulted in a notable decrease in the incidence of infection in the four studied cities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sustained transmission was likely occurring several weeks prior to the implementation of the cordon sanitaire in four major cities of mainland China and that the observed decrease in incidence was likely attributable to other non-pharmaceutical, transmission-reducing interventions.","output":"The effect of travel restrictions on the geographical spread of COVID-19 between large cities in China: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Childhood overweight and obesity have significant short- and long-term negative impacts on children's health and well-being. These challenges are unequally distributed according to socioeconomic status (SES); however, previous studies have often lacked standardized and objectively measured data across national contexts to assess these differences. This study provides a cross-sectional picture of the association between SES and childhood overweight and obesity, based on data from 123,487 children aged 6-9 years in 24 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region. Overall, associations were found between overweight/obesity and the three SES indicators used (parental education, parental employment status, and family-perceived wealth). Our results showed an inverse relationship between the prevalence of childhood overweight/obesity and parental education in high-income countries, whereas the opposite relationship was observed in most of the middle-income countries. The same applied to family-perceived wealth, although parental employment status appeared to be less associated with overweight and obesity or not associated at all. This paper highlights the need for close attention to context when designing interventions, as the association between SES and childhood overweight and obesity varies by country economic development.

AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented and daunting challenge for humanity to survive. This has also affected the sporting events across the globe as the majority of the tournaments have been cancelled or postponed as a result. For life to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, an effective and safe vaccination program needs to be implemented, be readily accessible, widely available, and affordable at the same time. Objectives. In this review, we analyze various challenges which demonstrate that COVID-19 is far from over.Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Medline, google scholar and Scopus from the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic to 22 June 2021. The current report is a summary of data regarding challenges faced by the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and the challenges for a transition toward normalcy especially for big sports events. Results. The current COVID-19 pandemic has likely resulted in sporting events and tournaments being canceled, postponed, or held without or with restricted spectators around the world. A combination of measures including prompt vaccination with the beneficial impact of the vaccines in reducing the severity of disease, advances in treatment, expanded use of diagnostics and better implementation of public-health policies are a necessity. Following this implementation, a transition toward normality could be expected when the mortality rate of COVID-19 simulates the average influenza statistics, with public-health measures continuing to play an important role worldwide. Conclusion. The authors believe that COVID-19 will be endemic in the human population, similar to seasonal influenza, and that COVID-19 vaccines will be included as an add-on to seasonal influenza vaccinations, being administered every winter for at least the next few decades.

Antibiotic treatment is available, but intolerable side effects and an increasing rate of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may hamper successful outcomes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer an alternative strategy for treatment of infectious diseases in which conventional antibiotic treatment fails. Human serum is a rich resource for endogenous AMPs. Therefore, we screened a library generated from hemofiltrate for activity against Mtb. Taking this unbiased approach, we identified Angiogenin as the single compound in an active fraction. The antimicrobial activity of endogenous Angiogenin against extracellular Mtb could be reproduced by synthetic Angiogenin. Using computational analysis, we identified the hypothetical active site and optimized the lytic activity by amino acid exchanges. The resulting peptide-Angie1-limited the growth of extra\\\\ and intracellular Mtb and the fast-growing pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Toward our long-term goal of evaluating Angie1 for therapeutic efficacy in vivo, we demonstrate that the peptide can be efficiently delivered into human macrophages via liposomes and is not toxic for zebrafish embryos. Taken together, we define Angiogenin as a novel endogenous AMP and derive the small, bioactive fragment Angie1, which is ready to be tested for therapeutic activity in animal models of tuberculosis and infections with fast-growing bacterial pathogens.","output":"Unbiased Identification of Angiogenin as an Endogenous Antimicrobial Protein With Activity Against Virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in the cities near to Wuhan remain not very clear","output":"Epidemiological and Clinical Features of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Changsha, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We are reporting the evaluation of an opportunistic point of care cervical cancer screening initiative in Pune, India using a mobile screening unit (MSU).
