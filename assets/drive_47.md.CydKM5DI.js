Despite antiretroviral therapy, longstanding HIV infection is associated with several chronic complications in children including growth failure, particularly stunting and delayed puberty. Vitamin D deficiency, which is highly prevalent among children living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, has a further adverse impact on bone health. This trial aims to establish whether supplementation with vitamin D(3) and calcium carbonate improves musculoskeletal health among peripubertal children living with HIV. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct an individually randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of weekly high-dose vitamin D(3) (20,000 IU) plus daily calcium carbonate (500mg) supplementation for 48 weeks. Eight hundred and forty children living with HIV aged 11C19 years taking ART for 6 months will be enrolled and followed up for 96 weeks. The primary outcome is total body less-head bone mineral content for lean mass adjusted for height (TBLH-BMC(LBM)) Z-score at 48 weeks, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Secondary outcomes are DEXA-measured lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density Z-score, number of respiratory infections, lean muscle mass and grip strength at 48 and 96 weeks and TBLH-BMC(LBM) Z-scores at 96 weeks. Sub-studies will investigate the effect of the intervention on vitamin D(3) pathway metabolites and markers of bone turnover, intestinal microbiota, and innate and acquired immune function. DISCUSSION: This is the largest trial to date of vitamin D supplementation in children living with HIV. Intervening to address deficits in bone accrual in childhood is critical for optimising adolescent and early adult bone health and prevention of later adult osteoporotic fractures. Trial results will draw attention to the need to screen for and treat long-term comorbidities in children living with HIV in resource-limited settings.

This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on EC educators' wellbeing and educator-child relationships, as growing evidence shows the influence of these factors on children's developmental outcomes. In July 2020, members of a Research Network of EC Professionals-who previously identified educator wellbeing as a priority issue-were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey included two published, validated scales: the Early Childhood Professional Wellbeing scale (ECPW) and the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (modified). Survey items about educators' experiences during the pandemic were also included. Two hundred and thirty-two EC educators from across Australia completed the survey, mostly from Victoria where lockdowns were most severe. Linear regression analysis demonstrated stronger professional wellbeing was associated with less conflict in educator-child relationships and lower risk of staff turnover. This was more likely to be experienced by senior or more experienced staff. Although a negative impact of COVID-19 was reported, ECPW scores were relatively high, and organizational structures supporting professional wellbeing were most strongly associated with lower risk of turnover (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Findings highlight that supporting EC educators' wellbeing is essential for workforce retention, and for promoting quality educator-child relationships which are central to young children's learning and development.","output":"Early Childhood Educators' Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, as in prior years, Medicaid physician fees remained well below Medicare and private insurance fees despite growth in Medicaid enrollment.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to present long-term clinical follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 vaccineCinduced SAT or GD cases and provide data regarding the safety of revaccinations. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 vaccineCinduced SAT or GD were included. Data regarding the long-term clinical follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 vaccineCinduced SAT and GD cases and outcomes of repeat or booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations were documented. The literature, including cases of SARS-CoV-2 vaccineCinduced SAT or GD, was reviewed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 vaccineCinduced SAT and 4 with GD were included. Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) was associated with symptoms in a majority of cases with SAT and all with GD. Median time from vaccination to symptom onset was 7 and 11.5 days, respectively, while 7 and 2 patients required medical treatment in SAT and GD groups, respectively. Remission was documented in 10 SAT patients, with a median time to remission of 11.5 weeks. No exacerbation/recurrence of SAT occurred in 7 of 9 patients who received a repeat vaccination dose, while symptoms of SAT worsened following the second vaccination in 2 cases. None of the patients experienced severe side effects that could be associated with revaccinations.

In contrast to bulky tumor cells, CSCs remain less differentiated and resistant to therapy even when targeted with tissue-specific antigenic markers. This makes CSCs responsible for not only tumor initiation, development, but also tumor recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that CSCs can undergo cell senescence, a non-proliferative state of cells in response to stress. While cell senescence attenuates tumor cell proliferation, it is commonly regarded as a tumor suppressive mechanism. However, mounting research indicates that CSC senescence also provides these cells with the capacity to evade cytotoxic effects from cancer therapy, exacerbating cancer relapse and metastasis. Recent studies demonstrate that senescence drives reprogramming of cancer cell towards stemness and promotes CSC generation. In this review, we highlight the origin, heterogeneity and senescence regulatory mechanisms of CSCs, the complex relationship between CSC senescence and tumor therapy, and the recent beneficial effects of senotherapy on eliminating senescent tumor cells.","output":"Mechanisms of Cancer Stem Cell Senescence: Current Understanding and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are heterogeneous: 46.4% of patients admitted into hospital reported to have at least one comorbidity.

Our aim was to investigate whether people with severe AAT deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of (severe) COVID-19 infection. We collected data on COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory-confirmed infection, hospitalization and treatment by means of a telephone survey, directly administered to Italian severe AATD subjects in May 2020. We then compared our findings with data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit on the total population in Italy during the same period. We found an higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort (3.8%) compared to national data regarding infection, thus giving severe AATD a relative risk of 8. 8 (95%CI 5.1-20,0; p<0.0001) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the relative risk (RR) was higher in AATD patients with pre-existing lung diseases (RR 13.9; 95%CI 8.0-33.6; p<0.001), but with a similar death rate (1 in 8, 12.5%) compared to the general population (13.9%; RR 0.9).

We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 a?? for 30 min. In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples. RESULTS: With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively. For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%.

Little is known about vaccines and forms of treatment at this point. However, the importance of preventing transmission is very clear, and one of the main measures is social isolation. Major sports tournaments, including soccer championships, have been suspended or cancelled due to COVID-19, on the grounds of our understanding of the importance of social isolation. Accordingly, large clubs have handed over their stadiums for the construction of field hospitals, and have encouraged health care by providing guidance on hygiene and social distancing. The involvement of soccer in the prevention of this pandemic is due to the fact that its managers understand the importance of this sport in the process, and its influence on fans and players. Over the years, soccer has incorporated scientific and technological knowledge into the game, which has frequently served as a role model for other types of sport and for the population. Therefore, in these extreme times of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no reason to believe it would be any different, and standpoints taken by soccer teams serve as an example and reiterate their role in the educational commitment to society and respect for government authorities. As a result, a protocol was drawn up for the resumption of training, in which all recommendations to be followed by players, managers/backroom staff and employees are in accordance with official health agencies of the national and international government. In other words, the resumption of training is subject to the authorization of government authorities.

ASMs differ in their potency and efficacy in controlling seizures by acting on diverse targets in the brain, often with variable pharmacokinetics. Moreover, nearly 30% of people with epilepsy have drug-resistant or intractable seizures. Generic substitution of ASMs is a complex issue. It is thought that frequent generic substitution in people with epilepsy may cause problems because FDA rules allow too much variability across products. The standard bioequivalence range (80% to 125%) appears too broad for many ASMs, especially those exhibiting little separation between therapeutic and toxic levels. Hence, sub-therapeutic concentration may lead to therapeutic failure with seizure recurrence , which could be life threatening. A supra-therapeutic level could result in adverse effects or compliance issues. There are reported issues with generic substitutions of phenytoin, topiramate, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine . There is discussion in the epilepsy community about additional guidelines, including designation of generic ASMs as Narrow Therapeutic Index (NTI) drugs and how patient education plays a role in generic substitution. Overall, based on the published evidence on specific generic ASMs, FDA bioequivalence standards are not the cause of problems with generic ASM substitution. Rather, it is imperative that physicians and pharmacists provide adequate patient education on what to expect when switching to generic ASMs, including changes in medication shape and color. Another suggestion would be to consider that all ASMs be considered for inclusion in NTI class to prevent the clinical outcome issues associated with generic ASM switching. Significance Statement There are critical aspects to consider when switching from a brand name antiseizure medication (ASM) when a generic becomes available or switching between generics. Generic ASMs are interchanged with little consideration of differences in therapeutic equivalence and other clinical factors. This article describes key issues on generic substitution of ASMs and highlights critical pharmacotherapeutic issues associated with generic ASMs.","output":"Therapeutic Basis of Generic Substitution of Antiseizure Medications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are frequent in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS). Here, we report on the clinical presentation of the first 100 patients who presented to our PCS Neurology outpatient clinic 12 weeks after the acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. To date, PCS is only defined by temporal connection to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Identification of clinical phenotypes and subgroups of PCS is urgently needed. Design: We assessed clinical data of our first 100 ambulatory patients regarding clinical presentations; self-questionnaires focusing on daytime sleepiness, mood, and fatigue; and a screening assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. Results: A total of 89% of the patients presenting to the Neurology outpatient clinic had an initially mild course of COVID-19 and had not been hospitalized. The majority of the patients were female (67 vs. 33% male). The most frequent symptom reported was cognitive impairment (72%). There were 30% of patients who reported cognitive deficits and scored below 26 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale. Fatigue (67%), headache (36%), and persisting hyposmia (36%) were also frequently reported; 5.5% of all patients showed signs of severe depression. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of patient data of a PCS Neurology outpatient clinic. Neurological sequelae also exist for more than 3 months after mainly mild SARS-CoV-2 acute infections.

A prospective study was done on 50 patients (both sexes) who required a tracheostomy and cared for at Command Hospital Bangalore Center between January 2019 and April 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential tests. Out of the 50 decannulation decisions, 7 patients experienced decannulation failures giving a failure rate of 14%. Out of the 7 decannulation failure cases, about 4 patients (10%) experienced difficulty in swallowing and 3 patients (2%) experienced stridor. There was no associated mortality. A decannulation failure of 14% was seen in this study in tracheostomised patients after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Various factors govern the success of tracheostomy decannulation procedures which occur during the first 24C48 h after decannulation.

Non-aerated lungs characterize the ARDS lungs, compared to normal lungs in the lowermost lung regions, compressive atelectasis. Heterogenous ARDS lungs have a tomographic vertical gradient characterized by progressively more aerated lung tissues from the gravity-dependent to gravity-independent lungs levels. The application of positive pressure ventilation to these heterogeneous ARDS lungs provides some areas of high shear stress, others of tidal hyperdistension or tidal recruitment that increases the chances of appearance and perpetuation of ventilator-induced lung injury. Other than helping to the correct diagnosis of ARDS, thoracic-computed tomography can help to the adjustments of PEEP, ideal tidal volume, and a better choice of patient position during invasive mechanical ventilation. Thoracic tomography can also help detect possible intra-thoracic complications and in the follow-up of the ARDS patients evolution during their hospital stay. In COVID-19 patients, thoracic-computed tomography was the most sensitive imaging technique for diagnosing pulmonary involvement. The most common finding is diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, ranging from ground-glass opacities to parenchymal consolidations, especially in the lower portions of the lungs periphery. Tomographic lung volume loss was associated with an increased risk for oxygenation support and patient intubation and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary dual-energy angio-tomography in COVID-19 patients showed a significant number of pulmonary ischemic areas even in the absence of visible pulmonary arterial thrombosis, which may reflect micro-thrombosis associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. A greater thoracic tomography severity score in ARDS was independently related to poor outcomes.","output":"Thoracic Computed Tomography to Assess ARDS and COVID-19 Lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structural inequities and lack of resources put vulnerable refugee communities at great risk.

We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication. METHODS We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times. RESULTS The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025). The patients' median overall summary score at baseline and at 3 months did not differ (P = .919). Three months after radiotherapy, most patients reported minimal adverse effects compared with baseline. CONCLUSION The GI-related PROs of patients with anal cancer tend to fluctuate during radiotherapy but return to baseline by 3 months, at which time most patients report few or no residual adverse effects.

To understand the potential of digital health interventions (DHIs) to prevent and reduce these problems, we conduct a meta-analysis and provide an overview of their effectiveness and characteristics related to the effects. We searched electronic databases and reference lists of relevant reviews to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in or before March 2020 evaluating DHIs on injury, violence, or suicide reduction. Based on the 34 RCT studies included in the meta-analysis, the overall random effect size was 0.21, and the effect sizes for reducing suicidal ideation, interpersonal violence, and unintentional injury were 0.17, 0.24, and 0.31, respectively, which can be regarded as comparable to the effect sizes of traditional face-to-face interventions. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies. In conclusion, DHIs have great potential to reduce unintentional injury, violence, and suicide.

METHOD We selected two relevant processing steps, denoise and segmentation, implemented by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models based on autoencoder architecture (encoder-decoder and UNet) and trained for the two tasks. In order to limit the number of uncontrolled variables, we designed a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different sizes, filled with iodinated contrast media. A large CT image dataset was collected at different acquisition settings and two reconstruction algorithms. We characterized the CNNs behavior using metrics from the signal detection theory, radiological and conventional image quality parameters, and finally unconventional radiomic features analysis. RESULTS The UNet, due to the deeper architecture complexity, outperformed the shallower encoder-decoder in terms of conventional quality parameters and preserved spatial resolution. We also studied how the CNNs modify the noise texture by using radiomic analysis, identifying sensitive and insensitive features to the denoise processing. CONCLUSIONS The proposed evaluation approach proved effective to accurately analyze and quantify the differences in CNNs behavior, in particular with regard to the alterations introduced in the processed images. Our results suggest that even a deeper and more complex network, which achieves good performances, is not necessarily a better network because it can modify texture features in an unwanted way.","output":"Addressing signal alterations induced in CT images by deep learning processing: A preliminary phantom study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Iran was one of the first countries to be affected by COVID-19. Identifying factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 is effective in disease management. This study investigated the epidemiological and clinical features and factors related to the severity of COVID-19 in one of the less privileged areas in Iran. METHODS: In a multi-center study, all patients admitted to Zahedan University of Medical Sciences hospitals in southeastern Iran were investigated from February 29 to April 31, 2020. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data of patients were extracted from medical records. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 413 patients, 55.5% were male, and 145 (35.10%) were in a severe condition at admission time. Multivariate analysis showed that the adjusted odds of the disease severity increased in patients with older age (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.41C3.65), substance abuse (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.14C5.43), having one underlying disease (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.90C2.55), having two underlying disease (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.19C4.50), and having three or more underlying disease (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.19C5.66).

Since March 2020, defense attorneys have argued for the release of their clients pending trial, persuasively contending that their clients should not be exposed to a potentially lethal contagious disease for a mere allegation of violating a law. This Essay proposes that courts use their authority to dismiss such cases in the interest of justice and provide a counter to prosecutorial discretion, which has failed to lead us out of over-incarceration in the midst of a pandemic. Fourteen states and Puerto Rico have long recognized judicial power to dismiss a case not on the legal merits, but in the interest of justice. Courts have historically invoked that power to respond to health crises. When COVID-19 transforms any type of carceral punishment into a lethal punishment, courts are equipped to consider these factual circumstances and take an action that most resonates with justice: dismissal. Similarly, when protesters are arrested, courts have occasionally dismissed charges in the interest of justice to protect the principles of freedom of speech. With tens of thousands of individuals arrested at protests during the pandemic, for crimes ranging from curfew violation to disorderly conduct to sedition, dismissal based on public interest and factual context rather than legal propriety may safeguard respect for the criminal legal process in a time when it is most challenged. Finally, state prosecutors nationally anticipate filing charges against defendants once the COVID-19 pandemic abates. In the face of what might be an overwhelming and under-scrutinized docket of cases, dismissal in the interest of justice may become a necessary judicial tool. Judges can dismiss charges in order to manage the docket, focus on higher-level criminal charges, and disrupt the heightened pressure on defendants to plead guilty, particularly to low-level offenses. Quick guilty pleas can result in defendants pleading to unsubstantiated allegations or to crimes they did not commit.This Essay proceeds in four parts. Part I introduces dismissal in the interest of justice, while Part II discusses the impact of COVID-19 on people incarcerated in jails and prisons and the relevance of dismissals during the pandemic. Part III explores the application of dismissal in the interest of justice to protest arrests during the pandemic and protecting freedom of speech principles. Lastly, Part IV suggests that judges dismiss stockpiled charges for which defendants received a citation or are released on bond and months later will face a criminal proceeding. These dismissals can lead to greater efficiency for courts as they face an overwhelming docket of backlogged cases.","output":"Pretrial Dismissal in the Interest of Justice: A Response to COVID-19 and Protest Arrests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paragangliomas are rare tumors of the endocrine system.

Since most previous studies that examined risk factors for mortality and severity were based on hospitalized individuals, population-based cohort studies are called for to provide evidence that can be extrapolated to the general population. Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations of comorbidities with mortality and disease severity in individuals with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Ontario, Canada. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada diagnosed between January 15 and December 31, 2020. Cases were linked to health administrative databases maintained in the ICES which covers all residents in Ontario. The primary outcome is all-cause 30-day mortality after the first COVID-19 diagnosis, and the secondary outcome is a composite severity index containing death and hospitalization. To examine the risk factors for the outcomes, we employed Cox proportional hazards regression models and logistic regression models to adjust for demographic, socio-economic variables and comorbidities. Results were also stratified by age groups. A total of 167,500 individuals were diagnosed of COVID-19 in 2020 and included in the study. About half (43.8%, n = 73,378) had at least one comorbidity. The median follow-up period were 30 days. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (24%, n = 40,154), asthma (16%, n = 26,814), and diabetes (14.7%, n = 24,662). Individuals with comorbidity had higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR = 2.80, 95%CI 2.35C3.34; p<0.001), and the risk substantially was elevated from 2.14 (95%CI 1.76C2.60) to 4.81 (95%CI 3.95C5.85) times as the number of comorbidities increased from one to five or more. Significant predictors for mortality included comorbidities such as solid organ transplant (HR = 3.06, 95%CI 2.03C4.63; p<0.001), dementia (HR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.35C1.58; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (HR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.34C1.57; p<0.001), severe mental illness (HR = 1.42, 95%CI%, 1.12C1.80; p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR = 1.22, 95%CI, 1.15C1.30), diabetes (HR = 1.19, 95%, 1.12C1.26; p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.12C1.26; p<0.001), cancer (HR = 1.17, 95%CI, 1.09C1.27; p<0.001), hypertension (HR = 1.16, 95%CI, 1.07C1.26; p<0.001). Compared to their effect in older age groups, comorbidities were associated with higher risk of mortality and severity in individuals under 50 years old. Individuals with five or more comorbidities in the below 50 years age group had 395.44 (95%CI, 57.93C2699.44, p<0.001) times higher risk of mortality compared to those without. Limitations include that data were collected during 2020 when the new variants of concern were not predominant, and that the ICES databases do not contain detailed individual-level socioeconomic and racial variables. CONCLUSION: We found that solid organ transplant, dementia, chronic kidney disease, severe mental illness, CVD, hypertension, COPD, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, and asthma were associated with mortality or severity. Our study highlights that the number of comorbidities was a strong risk factor for deaths and severe outcomes among younger individuals with COVID-19.

We used small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering combined with computational techniques to study the mechanism of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with hISG15. We showed that hISG15 undergoes a transition from an extended to a compact state after binding to PLpro, a conformation that has not been previously observed in complexes of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with ISG15 from other species. Furthermore, computational analysis showed significant conformational flexibility in the ISG15 N-terminal domain, suggesting that it is weakly bound to PLpro and supports a binding mechanism that is dominated by the C-terminal ISG15 domain.

A recently generated adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector, AAV-PHP.eB, has been found to penetrate the BBB more efficiently than other vectors including AAV-PHP.B. However, little is known about the mechanisms. In this study, we investigated how AAV-PHP.eB penetrates the BBB in mice. Methods: We injected AAV-PHP.eB into the bloodstream of wild-type C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice as well as mouse strains carrying genetic mutation in apolipoprotein E gene (Apoe) or low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (Ldlr), or lacking various components of the immune system. Then, we evaluated AAV-PHP.eB transduction to the brain and spinal cord in these mice. Results: We found that the transduction to the CNS of intravenous AAV-PHP.eB was more efficient in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice, and significantly reduced in Apoe or Ldlr knockout C57BL/6 mice compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, poor CNS transduction in BALB/c mice was dramatically increased by B-cell or natural killer-cell depletion.

Purpose: To examine the impact of COVID-19 and corresponding public health measures on the characteristics of common pediatric musculoskeletal injuries associated with sports. Study Design: Cohort study;Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study comparing patients with sports injuries presenting to 3 geographically diverse level I pediatric trauma hospitals and outpatient orthopaedic surgery clinics in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and a prepandemic period at the same institutions. Patients were included if they presented for care between February 15 and July 15 in 2020 (pandemic cohort) or between March 15 and April 15 in 2018 and 2019 (prepandemic cohort). Results: Included were 1455 patients with an average age of 12.1  4.5 years. When comparing patients presenting in 2018 and 2019 with those presenting in 2020, we observed a decrease in mean age during the pandemic (12.6  4.0 vs 11.0  5.2 years;P =.048). Additionally, a decrease in the proportion of injuries attributed to sports (48.8% vs 33.3%;P &lt;.001) and those occurring at school (11.9% vs 4.0%;P =.001) was observed. The proportion of injuries attributable to clavicle fractures increased during the early stages of the pandemic (13.2% vs 34.7%;P &lt;.001). There was no statistically significant delay to care in injuries presenting during the pandemic (41.5  141.2 vs 19.23  79.1 days;P =.175).

We investigated the degree to which people's work performance is affected and the association between sedentary behavior under the state of emergency and worsened work performance during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, as previous studies have suggested that sedentary behavior decreases work performance. METHODS: We used data from the Japan COVID\\\\19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS) study, a cross\\\\sectional, web\\\\based, self\\\\reported questionnaire survey. The main outcome was change in work performance after the COVID\\\\19 pandemic compared with that before the pandemic. We analyzed the association between the change in work performance and sitting duration under the state of emergency, adjusted for work\\\\related stress, participants demographics, socio\\\\economic status, health\\\\related characteristics, and personality. RESULTS: The change of work environment from the pandemic decreased work performance in 15% of workers, which was 3.6 times greater than the number of workers reporting increased performance in 14 648 workers (6134 women and 8514 men). Although telework both improved and worsened performance (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0, 1.6\\\\2.5 and 1.7, 1.5\\\\1.9, respectively), sitting for long periods after the state of emergency was significantly associated only with worsened performance (OR, 95% CI = 1.8, 1.5\\\\2.2) in a doseCresponse manner.

METHODS Our meta-analysis included 2,406 patients with 5,931 patient-years (PY) of follow-up from the PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device In Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trials, and their respective registries (Continued Access to PROTECT AF registry and Continued Access to PREVAIL registry). RESULTS With mean follow-up of 2.69 years, patients receiving LAAC with the Watchman device had significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes (0.15 vs. 0.96 events/100 patient-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; p = 0.004), cardiovascular/unexplained death (1.1 vs. 2.3 events/100 PY; HR: 0.48; p = 0.006), and nonprocedural bleeding (6.0% vs. 11.3%; HR: 0.51; p = 0.006) compared with warfarin. All-cause stroke or systemic embolism was similar between both strategies (1.75 vs. 1.87 events/100 PY; HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.7; p = 0.94).

Traditionally, most transmission models have assumed that all purchased cattle carry the same risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. Using data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example, this study provides empirical and theoretical evidence that the risk of disease transmission varies substantially based on the animal and herd demographic characteristics at the time of purchase. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that purchasing pregnant heifers and open cows sold with a calf at foot were associated with an increased risk of beef herds being seropositive for BVDV. Based on the results from a dynamic within-herd simulation model, these findings may be partly explained by the age-related probability of animals being persistently infected with BVDV as well as the herd demographic structure at the time of animal introductions. There was also evidence that an epidemiologically important network statistic, betweenness centrality (a measure frequently associated with the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease), was significantly higher for herds that supplied these particular types of replacement beef cattle. The trends for dairy herds were not as clear, although there was some evidence that open heifers and open lactating cows were associated with an increased risk of BVDV. Overall, these findings have important implications for developing simulation models that more accurately reflect the industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.","output":"Not all cows are epidemiologically equal: quantifying the risks of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) transmission through cattle movements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with COVID-19 could result in lockdown, quarantine of contacts, absenteeism from work, and temporary productivity loss. This research aims to calculate (1) how the pandemic affects on-the-job probability and earnings for the working population, and (2) how much productivity loss is associated with self or a family member sick with COVID-19. Based on data collected from the U.S Research and Development Survey (RANDS), this research projects the relationship between on-the-job possibility and age of the index group and calculates the employment possibilities of the index group relative to the healthy group, namely the employment ratio. The weekly loss of productivity, presented by earnings, associated with COVID-19 for groups aged 18C44 years and 45C64 years was calculated, since the 18- to 64-year-old population is an economys active workforce. Analytical results indicate that the older the age group, the lower the on-the-job possibility, and the higher the weekly productivity loss due to self or a family member being sick from COVID-19. For the group aged 45C64 years, the employment ratio of the index group relative to the healthy group dropped from 0.863 to 0.39, corresponding to a weekly productivity loss of 136C590 US dollars. The overall impact would be about a 9% loss in GDP. Infected or quarantined people would be confined to working in relatively isolated offices or places to allow for social distancing. Proactive health promotion in the workplace plus reactive work through telecommunication systems would reduce such losses.

Therefore, this study examined the psychological reactions of aging OHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD A convenience sample (N = 297, mean age = 66.85) of North American Jews rated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for their parents and for themselves. They further rated their psychological distress, COVID-19-related worries, loneliness, and social support. Respondents were divided into four groups: OHS with two parents with probable PTSD, with one such parent, with no such parent, and comparisons whose parents did not undergo the Holocaust. RESULTS OHS with two parents with PTSD reported the highest levels of PTSD symptoms. Controlling for respondents' own PTSD, OHS with two parents with PTSD reported higher psychological distress relative to comparisons. Moreover, OHS with parental PTSD reported higher loneliness relative to OHS without parental PTSD or comparisons. The groups did not differ in COVID-19-related worries or social support. CONCLUSIONS The distress experienced by OHS with parental PTSD seems more general, and is possibly related to the multiple coalescing crises that occurred since the pandemic began, rather than to the health risk associated directly with COVID-19. Moreover, while OHS acknowledge having good social support, some of them nevertheless feel lonely. This possibly reflects unique interpersonal difficulties characteristic in Holocaust survivor families.

METHODS: A 13-question survey containing multiple-choice, Likert-type, and free-text questions on experiences, behaviors, and attitudes during the COVID-19 outbreak was sent to childhood cancer caregivers and completed between April 13 and May 17, 2020. Ordered logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between demographics, COVID-related experiences, and caregiver well-being. RESULTS: Caregivers from 321 unique families completed the survey, including 175 with children under active surveillance/follow-up care and 146 with children no longer receiving oncology care. Overall, caregivers expressed exceptional resiliency, highlighting commonalities between caring for a child with cancer and adopting COVID-19 prophylactic measures. However, respondents reported delayed/canceled appointments (50%) and delayed/canceled imaging (19%). Eleven percent of caregivers reported struggling to pay for basic needs, which was associated with greater disruption to daily life, greater feelings of anxiety, poorer sleep, and less access to social support (p < .05).

It is still unclear either the less spreading of the virus or, the less progression to the severe illness. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the seropositivity rates (SPR) in the general population. We determined SPR in healthy office workers in Tokyo with validation of results by comparing two test results from the same individual a month apart. Method: Healthy office workers for a Japanese company in Tokyo were determined seropositivity against COVID19 weekly from May 26 to August 25, 2020, by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. SPR was calculated by pooled data from each two-week window. For each participant, tests were offered twice, separated by a month, to provide self-reference to validate the results. The seropositive individuals were offered a follow-up test on Dec 8th or 15th, 2020, when the third wave loomed in Tokyo, to determine the persistence of the seropositivity. Results: 615 volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0;45.7 % female) from 11 discrete locations received at least one test. 350 individuals completed two tests a month apart. The comparison showed that 93.2 % showed reasonable status changes and no instances with physiologically unexpected changes (e.g., IgG (+) turns IgM(+) in a month).

Conclusion: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely in Tokyo despite the low fatality. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the peak out of COVID-19 cases without a lockdown, temporary herd immunity might be achieved. However, the relatively short-lived antibodies among the asymptomatic individuals may explain why the herd immunity strategy has not succeeded, and COVID-19 resurgence happens every several months. Moreover, sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population level.","output":"Dynamic change of COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic office workers in Tokyo from May through Dec 2020 during the second waves of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Prompt diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are essential to combat the STI epidemic in resource-limited settings. We characterized the burden of 5 curable STIs chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, Mycoplasma genitalium, syphilis, and HIV infection in Ugandan men with urethritis. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a gonococcal surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda. Questionnaires, penile swabs were collected and tested by nucleic acid amplification. Gonococcal isolates were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. Sequential point-of-care tests on blood samples were used to screen for syphilis and HIV. Bivariable and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for preselected factors likely to be associated with STIs. Adherence to STI treatment guidelines were analyzed. RESULTS: From October 2019 to November 2020, positivity (95% CI) for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and Mycoplasma genitalium, were 66.4% (60.1%, 72.2%), 21.7% (16.8%, 27.4%), 2.0% (0.7%, 4.9%), and 12.4% (8.7%, 17.3%) respectively. All Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline, but susceptible to extended spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin. HIV and syphilis prevalence was 20.0% (50/250) and 10.0% (25/250), and the proportion unaware of their infection was 4.0% and 80.0% respectively. Most participants were treated per national guidelines. Multivariable analysis demonstrated significant associations between curable STI coinfections and younger age, transactional sex, but not HIV status, nor condom or alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: STI coinfections including HIV their associated risk factors, and gonococcal AMR were common in this population. The majority with syphilis were unaware of their infection and were untreated. Transactional sex was associated with STI coinfections, and > 80% of participants received appropriate treatment.

Peripheral induction of CTL specific for the nucleocapsid protein of JHMV by vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses was unable to provide significant protection to a subsequent lethal virus challenge. By contrast, the transfer of nucleoprotein-specific CTL protected mice from a subsequent lethal challenge by reducing virus replication within the central nervous system, demonstrating the importance of the CTL response to this epitope in JHMV infection. Transfer of these CTL directly into the central nervous system was at least 10-fold more effective than peripheral transfer. Histological analysis indicated that the CTL reduced virus replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Although the CTL were relatively ineffective at reducing virus replication in oligodendroglia, survivors showed minimal evidence of virus persistence within the central nervous system and no evidence of chronic ongoing demyelination.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes protect from lethal infection without eliminating virus from the central nervous system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Defining the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences, has potential to explain the range of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity.

Consistent with previous reports, a small set of bat and pangolin-derived Sarbecoviruses show the greatest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 but unlikely to be the direct source of SARS-CoV-2. Three proteins (nsp3, spike and orf9) showed differing regions between the bat Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 and indicate virus protein features that might have evolved to support human infection and/or transmission.

With the financial constraints faced by basic scientists, the ISTH organized a basic science task force (BSTF), comprising of SSC subcommittee chairs and co-chairs, to identify research opportunities for basic science in hemostasis and thrombosis. The goal of the BSTF was to develop a set of recommended priorities to build support in the thrombosis and hemostasis community and to inform ISTH basic science programs and policy making. The BSTF identified three principal opportunity areas that were of significant overarching relevance: Mechanisms Causing Bleeding, Innate Immunity and Thrombosis, and Venous Thrombosis. Within these, five fundamental research areas were highlighted: blood rheology, platelet biogenesis, cellular contributions to thrombosis and hemostasis, structure-function protein analyses, and visualization of hemostasis. This position paper discusses the importance and relevance of these opportunities, research areas and the rationale for their inclusion. These findings have implications for the future of fundamental research in thrombosis and hemostasis to make transformative scientific discoveries and tackle key clinical questions.

After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic developed, the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the pediatric emergency department (PED) visits have changed. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric OHCA in the PED. METHODS: From January 2018 to September 2021, we retrospectively collected data of children (18 years or younger) with a definite diagnosis of OHCA admitted to the PED. Patient data studied included demographics, pre-/in-hospital information, treatment modalities; and outcomes of interest included sustained return of spontaneous circulation (SROSC) and survival to hospital-discharge (STHD). These were analyzed and compared between the periods before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients with OHCA (68 boys and 29 girls) sent to the PED were enrolled in our study. Sixty cases (61.9%) occurred in the pre-pandemic period and 37 during the pandemic. The most common age group was infants (40.2%) (p = 0.018). Asystole was the most predominant cardiac rhythm (72.2%, P = 0.048). Eighty patients (82.5%) were transferred by the emergency medical services, 62 (63.9%) gained SROSC, and 25 (25.8%) were STHD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with non-trauma OHCA had significantly shorter survival duration and prolonged EMS scene intervals (both p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with OHCA had a significantly lower rate of SROSC and STHD than that in the pre-pandemic period.

In the absence of therapeutics, and low vaccination coverage, strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re-open societies. Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans. The objective of this scoping review is to (a) identify and map the different strategies for exit from lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence. METHODS: A five-step approach was used in this scoping review: (a) identifying the research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria; (b) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction; (e) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings. RESULTS: Of the 406 unique studies found, 107 were kept for full-text review. Studies suggest the post-peak period as optimal timing for an exit, supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity, and increased testing rate. A controlled and step-wise exit plan which is flexible and guided by information from surveillance systems is optimal. Studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of facemasks, and hygiene measures, in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained. CONCLUSION: Reviewed studies have suggested adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of different approaches depending on the context.

Simulation using a compartment model is used to provide insight into differences in response to public health interventions. Two case studies of interest from Nizamuddin and Dharavi provide contrasting pictures of the success in curbing spread. METHODS: A cluster analysis of the worst affected districts in India provides insight about the similarities between them. The effects of public health interventions in flattening the curve in their respective states is studied using the individual contact SEIQHRF model, a stochastic individual compartment model which simulates disease prevalence in the susceptible, infected, recovered and fatal compartments. RESULTS: The clustering of hotspot districts provide homogeneous groups that can be discriminated in terms of number of cases and related covariates. The cluster analysis reveal that the distribution of number of COVID-19 hospitals in the districts does not correlate with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. From the SEIQHRF model for Nizamuddin we observe in the second phase the number of infected individuals had seen a multitudinous increase in the states where Nizamuddin attendees returned, increasing the risk of the disease spread. However, the simulations reveal that implementing administrative interventions, flatten the curve. In Dharavi, through tracing, tracking, testing and treating, massive breakout of COVID-19 was brought under control.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether morphological or skill-related factors measured in the pre-season could predict injuries sustained in-season. METHOD: In our cohort study, 77 under-18 (U18), U19, U21 and senior elite netball players underwent pre-season testing including anthropometry, balance, flexibility, explosive power, upper and lower body strength, core strength, speed and agility testing. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, elite-level experience and injury history. Injuries in pre-season, training and matches were recorded during the subsequent 2017C2018 season using an injury profile sheet. RESULTS: Amongst the 77 players who underwent pre-season fitness tests, 33 players (42.9%) had at least one injury. Regarding player morphology, a significant association of body mass and body fat percentage with injury risk was found in a simple logistic regression. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, only fat percentage (p = 0.0508) remained a significant predictor of injury at the 10% significance level, with higher fat percentage being associated with lower injury risk. CONCLUSION: Heavier players and players with a higher fat percentage had a decreased injury risk. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As a result of the apparent protective effect of heavier weight of players, referees should more strictly enforce the no-contact rule in netball. Further research on functional movement screening as a tool for potential prediction of injury in netball is recommended.","output":"Morphological and skill-related fitness components as potential predictors of injury in elite netball players: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The STRIPES (Spectro-Temporal Ripple for Investigating Processor EffectivenesS) test is a psychophysical test of spectro-temporal resolution developed for cochlear-implant (CI) listeners.

Here, the effect of relaxing many of those controls was investigated to ascertain the generalizability of the STRIPES test. Preemphasis compensation was removed from the STRIPES stimuli, the test was presented over a loudspeaker at a level similar to conversational speech and above the automatic gain control threshold of the CI processor, and listeners were tested using the everyday setting of their clinical devices.

Some members of the Caliciviridae, i.e. human pathogenic norovirus or rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), are worldwide emerging pathogens. The norovirus is the major cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, accounting for about 85% of the outbreaks in Europe between 1995 and 2000. In the United States, 25 million cases of infection are reported each year. Since its emergence in 1984 as an agent of fatal hemorrhagic diseases in rabbits, RHDV has killed millions of rabbits and has been dispersed to all of the inhabitable continents. In view of their successful and apparently increasing emergence, the development of antiviral strategies to control infections due to these viral pathogens has now become an important issue in medicine and veterinary medicine. Antiviral strategies have to be based on an understanding of the epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms, viral replication and immunity to infection resulting from infection by these viruses. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying calicivirus infection, focusing on the molecular aspects of replication in the host cell. Recent experimental data generated through an international collaboration on structural biology, virology and drug design within the European consortium VIZIER is also presented.

To assess the level of psychological stress, an Impact of the Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire was used. The results indicated that 34.4% of the participants who were interviewed were affected by subjective distress while 26.4% rated their psychological impact from the sports activity interruption as severe. Separated one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests showed significant differences in the IES-R total score (TS), indicating that the level of stress in terms of gender revealed that women were more stressed than men (p = 0.000), for \\"sports roles\\" in which the manager and coaches were more stressed than the athletes (p < 0.05), and \\"type of sport\\" in which fitness and individual athletes were more stressed than team athletes (p < 0.01). The middle-level athletes showed significantly more hyperarousal levels than high-level athletes (p = 0.012). The results of this survey may raise awareness of this problem and help athletic associations to have appropriate guidelines in order to better sustain their memberships and organize an optimal resumption of their sports activities. Along these lines, social interactions, which are typical of team sports, are crucial to warrant resilience and psychological health.

RESULTS A total of 347 patients were included with a mean age of 68.5 years, who were predominantly males (59.94%), bedbound (69.74%), on tube feeding (66.86%), and required indwelling urinary catheters (61.96%). The total number of admissions during the first year was 498, with the mean length of stay being 30 days. The number of infectious syndromes identified during that period was 821episodes, with a mean of 2 infectious syndromes per admission. The most common infection identified was pneumonia (41.66%) followed by urinary tract infections (27.16%). A total of 3891 microbiological cultures were taken with a mean of 5 cultures per infectious syndrome. The most commonly identified pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (61.03%), with a high rate of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (48.53%). The one-year mortality was 86.4%.

This study aimed to determine the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of IBD patients on biologic therapy in Lombardy, the hardest-hit Italian region by the pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective multicentre study collecting data about COVID-19 in IBD patients on biologic therapy in regular clinical follow-up at 11 IBD referral units in Lombardy, between February 20th and May 20th, 2020. The main endpoints were to assess the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and its outcome (hospitalization/death) among IBD patients on biologic therapy and to identify any variations among the different classes of biologic agents. Secondarily, we compared the results with the incidence of COVID-19 in the general population of Lombardy in the same period and the incidence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in our study population compared with those of a second cohort of IBD patients undergoing non-biological therapies and coming from the same geographic area. RESULTS: Overall, 1816 IBD patients on biologic therapy were enrolled. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 3.9 per 1000 (7/1816) with a hospitalization rate of 57% and a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 29%. In our Cohort, the gut-selective therapy (Vedolizumab and Etrolizumab) was the only risk factor of developing symptomatic COVID-19 (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.7C45.0, p = 0.01). Conversely, non-gut selective anti-cytokine agents were associated with a lower incidence of infection (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02C0.74) and development of symptoms (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.37C0.98). Compared to the general population of Lombardy, a lower incidence of COVID-19 was observed (3.9 vs 8.5 per 1000 with a RR 0.45, 95%CI 0.21C0.95); conversely, in terms of hospitalization rate and CFR, the clinical outcome was not statistically different. Finally, compared to a second cohort of 565 IBD patients treated with non-biologic conventional therapies, a significantly lower risk of symptomatic disease was observed in patients on biologic agents (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2C0.4, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to the general population, IBD patients on biologic therapy are not exposed to a higher risk of COVID-19; compared to gut-selective agents, cytokine blockers are associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic infection, supporting the decision of maintaining the ongoing treatment.","output":"P612 Lower incidence of COVID-19 in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases treated with non-gut-selective biologic therapy: an observational multicentre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Email viruses are one of the main security problems in the Internet.

The Japanese government focused on mitigating the emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases continued to appear until early April 2020, many with unclear infection routes and no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from the COVID-19 cases that appeared until early April 2020 and to characterize their genealogical networks in order to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February 2020 in Japan descended directly from the Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates from China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that the COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have created an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. In conclusion, genome surveillance has suggested that there were at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Japan from China and other countries.

Given our detailed integrative computational analysis, a Small molecule (3,3-Dimethyl-N-[4-(1-piperidinylcarbonyl) phenyl] butanamide) with drug-like properties and high binding affinity with the NSP15 is proposed as a most promising potential drug against COVID-19. The current computational integrative approach may complement high-throughput screening and the shortlisted small molecule may contribute to selective targeting of NSP15 to stop the replication of SARS-CoV2.","output":"Drug designing against NSP15 of SARS-COV2 via high throughput computational screening and structural dynamics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the need for psychological care in the global population and has created new barriers to accessing services. Hospitals, mental health facilities, and other clinics face the challenge of providing continued care to a population that is under severe stress, while minimizing in-person visits that risk spreading the virus. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,286 sites. VHA ensured the continuity of mental health services after the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly expanding its use of telemental health methods in the first weeks after the U.S. pandemic outbreak. VHA provided nearly 1.2 million telephone and video encounters to veterans in April 2020 and reduced in-person visits by approximately 80% when compared with the October 2019 to February 2020 period before the pandemic. By June 2020, VHA had an 11-fold increase in encounters using direct-to-home video and a fivefold increase in telephone contacts relative to before the pandemic. This article discusses research on the effectiveness of telemental health, VHA policies before COVID-19 that facilitated the use of telemental health systemwide, and VHA's actions that rapidly scaled use of telemental health during the first months of the outbreak. Key challenges and lessons learned from VHA's experience and implications for providers and health care systems regarding the use of telemental health to meet patients' mental health care needs during the pandemic are also discussed.

With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID\\\\19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three\\\\level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third\\\\party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID\\\\19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply\\\\chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase.

While an overall Th1-biased cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated, most reports of anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity have evaluated bulk T cells using pools of predicted epitopes, without clear delineation of the CD8(+) subset and its magnitude and targeting. In recently infected persons (mean 29.8 days after COVID-19 symptom onset), we confirm a Th1 bias (and a novel IL-4-producing population of unclear significance) by flow cytometry, which does not correlate to antibody responses against the receptor binding domain. Evaluating isolated CD8(+) T cells in more detail by IFN- ELISpot assays, responses against spike, nucleocapsid, matrix, and envelope proteins average 396, 901, 296, and 0 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million, targeting 1.4, 1.5, 0.59, and 0.0 epitope regions respectively. Nucleocapsid targeting is dominant in terms of magnitude, breadth, and density of targeting. The magnitude of responses drops rapidly post-infection; nucleocapsid targeting is most sustained, and vaccination selectively boosts spike targeting. In SARS-CoV-2-na?ve persons, evaluation of the anti-spike CD8(+) T cell response soon after vaccination (mean 11.3 days) yields anti-spike CD8(+) T cell responses averaging 2,463 SFC/million against 4.2 epitope regions, and targeting mirrors that seen in infected persons.

Second, it assessed whether substance use in the presence of discrimination differed between ACE subgroups. Latent class analysis identified two emerging ACE subgroups: [1] Parental Separation and [2] Physical & Emotional. On average, individuals in the Physical & Emotional subgroup endorsed a higher likelihood of tobacco, cannabis, and illegal drug use than those in the Parental Separation subgroup. For the latter, the likelihood of binge drinking was higher than that of the Physical & Emotional subgroup if they also perceived discrimination in emerging adulthood.

But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 influenza illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (Na?=a?5018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis. The rift seems to be between people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The French public's attitudes to a future COVID-19 vaccine: The politicization of a public health issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fundamental challenge complicates news decisions about covering vaccine side effects: although serious vaccine side effects are rare, less severe ones do occur occasionally. The study was designed to test whether a side effect message could induce vaccine hesitancy and whether that could be countered by pro-vaccine messages about vaccine safety. A large (N = 2,345), nationally representative experiment was conducted by randomly exposing participants to one of six videos about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine edited from news programs produced during the 2019 measles outbreak in the United States. The design was a 2x3 factorial crossing the presence or absence of a hesitancy-inducing narrative message with a pro-vaccine science-supporting message (i.e., no message, science-supporting expert message, or pro-vaccine narrative message), leading to a total of six conditions. A general linear model was used to assess the effects of these videos on respondents (1) vaccine risk perceptions, (2) policy views on vaccination, (3) willingness to encourage others to vaccinate their children, and (4) intention to send a pro-vaccine letter to their state representative. Findings indicated that the science-supporting expert message about vaccine safety led to higher pro-vaccine evaluations relative to other conditions [e.g., b = -0.17, p < .001, a reduction in vaccine risk perceptions of 0.17 as compared to the control]. There was also suggestive evidence that the hesitancy-inducing narrative may limit the effectiveness of a science-supporting expert message, although this finding was not consistent across different outcomes. When shown alone the hesitancy-inducing narrative did not shift views and intentions, but more research is needed to ascertain whether exposure to such messages can undercut the pro-vaccine influence of science-supporting (expert) ones. All in all, however, it is clear that science-supporting messages are effective and therefore worthwhile in combating vaccine misinformation.","output":"The effects of scientific messages and narratives about vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the governments are trying to contain the spread with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing rules, restrictions, and lockdowns.

Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask. The proposed device reveals potential applications for the future development of smart masks with coupled energy-harvesting devices, allowing to use them not only for anti-infective protection but also to supply sensors or active antibacterial/viral devices.","output":"Metal-Free Multilayer Hybrid PENG Based on Soft Electrospun/-Sprayed Membranes with Cardanol Additive for Harvesting Energy from Surgical Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID19) appears to be an inflection point that is forcing a disruption in medical education.

The decontamination procedures were hot water at 40 C and 80 C; autoclave; microwave at 750 W; and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. After each decontamination procedure, the bacterial load reduction of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was recorded to verify the effectiveness of these methods and, moreover, bacterial filtration efficiency and breathability tests were performed to evaluate mask performances. The best results were obtained with the immersion in 80 C water and the microwave-assisted sterilization. Both methods achieved a high degree of mask decontamination without altering the filtration efficiency and breathability, in accordance with the quality standard.

Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by immunologic dysregulation, especially within the cellular immune compartment. However, it is unclear if persistent mild-to-moderate COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity. To this end, we analyzed the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms, or symptoms persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms minimally impacts the magnitude, antigen specificity, and transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity within both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments.

This cysteine protease/Mpro of SARS CoV-2 has high sequence similarity with the same protease from SARS CoV-1. Previously, it has been shown experimentally that eight polyphenols derived from the root of Isatis indigotica show inhibitory effect on the cleavage/catalytic activity of the SARS CoV-1 Mpro. But whether these polyphenols exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is unclear. To explore this possibility, here, we have adopted various computational approaches. Polyphenols that qualified the pharmacological parameters (indigo, sinigrin, hesperetin and daidzein) and two well-known Mpro inhibitors (N3 and lopinavir) were subjected to molecular docking studies. Two of them (sinigrin and hesperetin) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with N3 and lopinavir. Sinigrin and hesperetin interacted with the two most important catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these two Mpro-polyphenol complexes are more stable and experience less conformational fluctuations than Mpro-N3/lopinavir complex. The Mpro-hesperetin complex was more compact and less expanded than Mpro-sinigrin complex. These findings were additionally validated by MM-GBSA analysis. As a whole, our study revealed that these two polyphenols may be potent SARS CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and may possibly be considered for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Depicting the inhibitory potential of polyphenols from Isatis indigotica root against the main protease of SARS CoV-2 using computational approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD) and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close, but poorly understood, association. There is paucity of evidence on the ideal secondary prophylaxis and etiological determination, with few cardioembolic patients being identified. AIMS: This study aimed to describe a multicenter cohort of patients with concomitant CD and IS admitted in tertiary centers and to create a predictive model for cardioembolic embolism in CD and IS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed. A prediction model for cardioembolism was proposed with 70% of the sample as the derivation sample, and the model was validated in 30% of the sample. RESULTS: A total of 499 patients were analyzed. The median age was similar in both groups; however, patients with cardioembolic embolism were younger and tended to have higher alcoholism, smoking, and death rates. The predictive model for the etiological classification showed close relation with the number of abnormalities detected on echocardiography and electrocardiography as well as with vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results replicate in part those previously published, with a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors and lower median age in patients with cardioembolic etiology. Our new model for predicting cardioembolic etiology can help identify patients with higher recurrence rate and therefore allow an optimized strategy for secondary prophylaxis.","output":"Artificial Inteligence-Based Decision for the Prediction of Cardioembolism in Patients with Chagas Disease and Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, which is causing a global pandemic. One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","output":"Reaction Cycles of Halogen Species in the Immune Defense: Implications for Human Health and Diseases and the Pathology and Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to predictions of a widespread mental health crisis.

In this perspective article, we focus on the association among three major worldwide health issues and how ERAS protocols can potentially provide optimal management of patients with obesity and malignancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special attention to patients who required surgery for gynecologic oncology. A thorough search of the literature on the respective topics was performed. Patients with malignancy and obesity presented with increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. However, the management of their disease should not be withheld. Protective measures should be established to reduce exposure of patients with oncological diseases to SARS-CoV-2 while simultaneously enabling their access to vaccination. Since ERAS protocols have proved to be efficient in many surgical fields, including gynecologic oncology, general surgery, and orthopedics, we strongly believe that ERAS protocols may play a significant role in this effort.

Obesity, minimal leisurely activity, binge drinking, and higher rates of individuals taking high blood pressure medication were associated with increased case fatality rate in a county. Political leaning influences case case-fatality rates. Regional trends showed contrasting effects where larger household size was protective in the Midwest, yet harmful in Northeast. Notably, higher rates of respiratory comorbidities such as asthma and COPD diagnosis were associated with reduced case-fatality rates in the Northeast. Increased rates of CKD within counties were often the strongest predictor of increased case-fatality rates for several regions.

BACKGROUND: Midwives provide care to childbearing women across the continuum and are key members of the maternity workforce in Australia. AIM: To explore and describe midwives experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A two-phased cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected through an online survey and semi-structured interviews between May-June 2020. FINDINGS: Six hundred and twenty midwives responded to the online survey. Many reported a move to telehealth appointments. For labour care, 70% of midwives reported women had limited support; 77% indicated postnatal visiting was impacted. Five main themes were derived from the qualitative data including: coping with rapid and radical changes, challenges to woman-centred care, managing professional resilience, addressing personal and professional challenges, and looking ahead. DISCUSSION: Restrictions applied to womens choices, impacted midwives ability to provide woman-centred care, which resulted in stress and anxiety for midwives. Professional resilience was supported through collaborative relationships and working in continuity models. Midwives revealed silver linings experienced in providing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Findings provide valuable evidence to understand the impact on midwives who have provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge will be useful for health leaders and policy makers as they consider ways to continue care during the pandemic and support the essential midwifery workforce.

Given the complexity of this role, a realist approach to evaluation has been undertaken as described in this protocol, which sets out a study design spanning from August 2020 to June 2021.Methods and analysisThe intention of conducting a realist review is to identify the circumstances and mechanisms that determine the outcomes of the assistant in medicine intervention. We will start by developing an initial programme theory to explore the potential function of the assistant in medicine role through realist syntheses of critically appraised summaries of existing literature using relevant databases and journals. Other data sources such as interviews and surveys with key stakeholders will contribute to the refinements of the programme theory. Using this method, we will develop a set of hypotheses on how and why the Australian assistants in medicine intervention might work to achieve a variety of outcomes based on examples of related international interventions.

The DM workflow encompasses specimen preparation, whole-slide image acquisition, slide retrieval, and the workstation, each of which has the potential (depending on the technical parameters) to introduce limitations and artifacts into microscopic examination by pathologists. Performing validation studies according to guidelines established in human pathology ensures that the best-practice approaches for patient care are not deteriorated by implementing DM. Whereas current publications on validation studies suggest an overall high reliability of DM, each laboratory is encouraged to perform an individual validation study to ensure that the DM workflow performs as expected in the respective clinical or research environment. With the exception of validation guidelines developed by the College of American Pathologists in 2013 and its update in 2021, there is no current review of the application of methods fundamental to validation. We highlight that there is high methodological variation between published validation studies, each having advantages and limitations. The diagnostic concordance rate between DM and LM is the most relevant outcome measure, which is influenced (regardless of the viewing modality used) by different sources of bias including complexity of the cases examined, diagnostic experience of the study pathologists, and case recall.

However, the number of confirmed cases and RT-PCR tests per million population are lower than for other countries, which leads to uncertainty about the actual extent of the pandemic. In Mexico City, health care workers represent an important fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This work aims to estimate the frequency of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers at a non-COVID hospital, as well as identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population. Methods: We conducted a serological survey in a large non-COVID teaching hospital in Mexico City. The study population included all the personnel that works, in any capacity, in the hospital. From this population we selected a representative sample of 300 individuals. Blood samples were collected and questionnaires were applied between August 10th and September 9th, 2020. Results: ELISA results indicate a serological prevalence to SARS-CoV-2 infection of 13.0%. Working in the janitorial and security groups, having an educational level below a university degree, and living with larger numbers of people, were also identified as sociodemographic factors that increase the risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Even though the rate from the official number of confirmed cases in Mexico City is substantially smaller than the seropositive rate identified in this work, even in health care workers there is still a majority of individuals that are seronegative, and thus the risk of continued epidemic waves and mortality remains high.","output":"Serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated factors in health care workers in a \\"non-COVID\\" hospital in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the coronavirus disease 2019 perioperative infection rate and mortality rate of patients undergoing urological surgeries during the early pandemic period in Spain.

The primary objective of this study was to determine if the implementation of a designated COVID-19 cohort area (hot zone) within a busy ED mitigated the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the rest of the department. METHODS: In an ED of a tertiary academic medical center, with 64,000 annual visits, an eight room pod was designated for known COVID-19 or individuals with high suspicion for infection. There was a single entry and exit for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers (HCW) changed gowns and gloves between patients, but maintained their N-95 mask and face shield, cleaning the shield with a germicidal wipe between patients. Staffing assignments designated nurses and technicians to remain in this area for 4 h, where physicians regularly moved between the hot zone and rest of the ED. Fifteen surface samples and four air samples were taken to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 contamination levels and the effectiveness of infection control practices. Samples were collected outside of patient rooms in 3 primary ED patient care areas, the reception area, the primary nurses station, inside the cohort area, and the PPE donning and doffing areas immediately adjacent. Samples were recovered and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on any surface samples, including in and around the cohort area. All air samples outside the COVID-19 hot zone were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but air samples within the cohort area had a low level of viral contamination.

Our study aimed at assessing the frequency of vascular and extravascular events distribution in a retrospective cohort of 42 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated by whole-body CT angiography between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Twenty-three out of the 42 patients evaluated were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Vascular and extravascular findings were categorized into relevant or other/incidental, first referring to the need for immediate patient care and management. Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher exact test was used to compare study groups, where appropriate. RESULTS: Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of cases (n = 30). Pulmonary embolism was the most frequent in both ICU and non-ICU cases (56.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.002). Ischemic infarctions at several sites such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney were detected (n = 20), with multi-site involvement in some cases. Systemic venous thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of cases compared to 7.1% of systemic arterial events, the first being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the study population, with no significant differences in ICU and non-ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular involvement is not negligible in COVID-19 and should be carefully investigated as it may significantly affect disease behavior and prognosis. KEY POINTS: ?

In this study, PLpro and RdRp, two immunogenic non-structural proteins from an immunodominant gene region ORF1ab, as well as ORF3a and ORF9b are identified as potential vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2. To select top epitopes for vaccine design, we used various clinical properties, such as antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and IFN-y secretion. The analysis of CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes revealed multiple potential vaccine constructs that cover a high percentage of the world population. We identified 8 immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD8 proteins for nsp3, 4 for nsp12, 11 for ORF3a and 3 for ORF9b that are common across four lineages of variants of concern C B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, which protect 98.12%, 87.08%, 96.07% and 63.8% of the world population, respectively.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive analytical study Place and Duration of Study: Armed Forces Institute of Radiology and Imaging, (AFIRI) Rawalpindi, from April 2020 to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: Five hundred suspected COVID-19 cases referred for high resolution computed tomography - chest were included in the study. Cases were categorised by radiological findings using COVID-19 pneumonia imaging classification, proposed in the radiological society of North America expert consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to COVID-19. CT-SS was calculated for all scans. Patients were clinically classified according to disease severity as per 'Diagnosis And Treatment Program of Pneumonia of New Coronavirus Infection' recommended by China's National Health Commission. The relationships between radiological findings, CT-SS, and clinical severity were explored. RESULTS: Based on the radiological findings, 298 cases were graded as typical, 34 as indeterminate, 15 as atypical, and 153 as negative for pneumonia. The apical and posterior basal segments of lower lobes were most commonly involved. The CT-SS showed higher values in patients of severe group as compared to those in moderate group (p < 0.05). CT-SS threshold for recognising severe COVID-19 was 18.5 (area under curve, 0.960), with 84.3% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity.

We investigated the applicability of the technique to intraoperative evaluation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS This retrospective study analyzed 85 HCCs treated with RFA using extracted-overlay fusion imaging for guidance and evaluation. To perform RFA, an electrode was inserted targeting the tumor and a virtual 5-mm ablative margin overlaid on the US image. Following ablation, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) was performed to assess the ablative margin, and the minimal ablative margins were categorized into three groups: (I) margin <0 mm (protrusion), (II) margin 0 to <5 mm, and (III) margin 5 mm. Margin assessment was based on the positional relationship between the overlaid tumor plus margin and the perfusion defect of the ablation zone. Tumors in group I underwent repeat ablation until they were in groups II or III. The final classifications were compared with those obtained by retrospectively created fusion images of pre- and post-RFA CT or MR imaging (CT-CT/MR-MR fusion imaging). RESULTS Treatment evaluation was impossible using CEUS in six HCCs because the tumors were located far below the body surface. Of the remaining 79 HCCs, the categorizations of minimal ablative margins between CEUS extracted-overlay fusion imaging and CT-CT/MR-MR fusion imaging were in agreement for 72 tumors (91.1%) (Cohen's quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient 0.66, good agreement, p<0.01).

In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. METHODS: We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome. RESULTS: We identified six studies. In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic. Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic. Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies. In 2020, 3.9-5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8-26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea). CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems.

Here, we report the complicated long-term course of a VITT patient with extremely high titers of pathogenic anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)-IgG antibodies. Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings are presented, including the course of platelet counts, D-Dimer levels, clinical presentation, imaging, SARS-CoV-2-serological and immunological, platelet activating anti-PF4-IgG, as well as autopsy findings. Results: The patient presented with extended superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with accompanying bifrontal intracerebral hemorrhage. Repeated treatment with intravenous immune globuline (IVIG) resolved recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia. Moreover, the patients serum remained strongly positive for platelet-activating anti-PF4-IgG over three months. After a period of clinical stabilization, the patient suffered a recurrent and fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions: Complicated VITT with extremely high anti-PF4-IgG titers over three months can induce recurrent thrombocytopenia despite treatment with IVIG and anticoagulation. Plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, and /or immunosuppressive treatment may be considered in complicated VITT to reduce extraordinarily high levels of anti-PF4-IgG.

RESULTS: A total of 29 articles met inclusion criteria, most of which originated from the United States (n=18, 62.1%). Rates of burnout ranged from 6.0% to 86.0%. Personal factors responsible for burnout were fear of contracting/transmitting COVID-19 (8 studies, 27.6%), female gender (8, 27.6%), and younger age (5, 17.2%). Professional factors contributing to burnout included increased COVID-19 patient clinical load (6, 20.7%), limited work experience (6, 20.7%), reduction in operative cases (5, 17.2%) and redeployment to COVID-19 wards (4, 13.8%). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted surgical education due to reduced number of operative cases (11, 37.9%), decreased hands-on experience (4, 13.8%), and not being able to complete case requirements (3, 10.34%).

It is supposed that the virus causes cell injury by acting on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors which causes an increase in the level of Angiotensin II, leading to inflammation and lung injury. An essential vitamin can prevent this in our body that is vitamin D. It acts on Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibiting the action of renin and also by increasing production of ACE2 and hence Angiotensin II level decreases which prevent inflammation and lung injury. So vitamin D has a remarkable and pivotal role in modulation of the immune system of our body and hence protects human from this fatal disease.","output":"Role of vitamin d in prevention of corona virus infection (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional objects can be represented using Cartesian, spherical or cylindrical coordinate systems, among many others. Currently all protein 3D structures in the PDB are in Cartesian coordinates. We wanted to explore the possibility that protein 3D structures, especially the globular type (spheroproteins), when represented in spherical coordinates might find useful novel applications. A Fortran program was written to transform protein 3D structure files in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to spherical coordinates (, ?, ), with the centroid of the protein molecule as origin. We present here two applications, namely, (1) separation of the protein outer layer (OL) from the inner core (IC); and (2) identifying protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface. In the first application, ? and  were partitioned into suitable intervals and the point with maximum  in each such ?- bin was determined. A suitable cutoff value for  is adopted, and for each ?- bin, all points with  values less than the cutoff are considered part of the IC, and those with  values equal to or greater than the cutoff are considered part of the OL. We show that this separation procedure is successful as it gives rise to an OL that is significantly more enriched in hydrophilic amino acid residues, and an IC that is significantly more enriched in hydrophobic amino acid residues, as expected. In the second application, the point with maximum  in each ?- bin are sequestered and their frequency distribution constructed (i.e., maximum ѡs sorted from lowest to highest, collected into 1.50?-intervals, and the frequency in each interval plotted). We show in such plots that invaginations on the protein surface give rise to subpeaks or shoulders on the lagging side of the main peak, while protrusions give rise to similar subpeaks or shoulders, but on the leading side of the main peak. We used the dataset of Laskowski et al.

However, there has not been enough scientific evidence to prove whether the result is just a profibrotic response or not. We aimed to find the optimal skin rejuvenation device that shows true neocollagenesis. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated dermal collagen thickness and gene expression of procollagen type 1, 3, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) resulting from different energy-based devices in a rat model in vivo. The wound-healing response was evaluated histologically and by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at immediate, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week after the initial procedure. RESULTS At the 12th week, the most relevant changes of the dermal thickness were found in specimens after treatment with electrosurgical unit, fractional CO2 and 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG. Procollagen 1 and 3 were also found to be the highest in electrosurgical unit, fractional CO2 , and microneedle radiofrequency. Dramatic changes of MMP-3 and TGF- were remarkable at the early observation but went back to normal level at 12th week. The ratio of procollagen 1 and 3 was found to be the lowest with Q-Switched Nd:YAG 1064 nm and fractional CO2 . CONCLUSION Electrosurgical unit resulted in most significant changes, but due to irreversible thermal damage and extremely high procollagen results it is considered as a profibrotic response. Fractional CO2 and Q-Switched Nd:YAG 1064 nm are applicable to face skin rejuvenation treatment considering thickening of dermal tissue and lower procollagen 1:3 ratio similar to the neocollagenesis purpose.

NCL modulates of uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and different signaling pathways in human biological processes. The wide-spectrum antiviral effect of NCL makes it a possible candidate for recent pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection and may reduce Covid-19 severity. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to review and clarify the potential role of NCL in Covid-19. METHODS: This study reviewed and highlighted the protective role of NCL therapy in Covid-19. A related literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct was done. RESULTS: NCL has noteworthy anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. The primary antiviral mechanism of NCL is through neutralization of endosomal PH and inhibition of viral protein maturation. NCL acts as a proton carrier, inhibits homeostasis of endosomal PH, which limiting of viral proliferation and release. The anti-inflammatory effects of NCL are mediated by suppression of inflammatory signaling pathways and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the major limitation in using NCL is low aqueous solubility, which reduces oral bioavailability and therapeutic serum concentration that reducing the in vivo effect of NCL against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: NCL has anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects by modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of NF-B /NLRP3 inflammasome and mTOR signaling pathway. NCL has an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect via interruption of viral life-cycle and/or induction of cytopathic effect.

A typical feature of COVID-19 is the suppression of type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I/MDA-5CMAVS signaling. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses type I and III IFN induction stimulated by SeV infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1, thus preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 and subsequently impeding the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Consequently, ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and illuminates the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) membrane (M) protein inhibits type I and III interferon production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 globally, more than 40,000 healthcare staff rushed to Wuhan, Hubei Province to fight against this threatening disease.

Understanding patients' perceptions of the disruptions in care and their willingness to reengage the healthcare system are crucial to planning the resumption of elective care. Questions/Purposes: The purpose of this study was to elicit patient perceptions about delays in total joint arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We identified a consecutive series of patients who experienced COVID-19-driven delays to scheduled total hip or knee arthroplasty at an urban, academic medical center in the Southeastern United States. A 20-item survey was administered via telephone. Answers were recorded and descriptive statistics were performed. A post hoc &#967;-square analysis compared characteristics and outlooks of patients who did and did not immediately desire surgery. Results: Of 111 patients (64% of those identified) who met inclusion criteria and completed the survey, 96% said they felt that they were treated fairly and 90% said that the surgical delay was in their best interest; 68% reported emotional distress from the delay, but 45% reported a desire to wait longer for the pandemic to subside. Lower joint-function scores, higher pain levels, higher pain catastrophizing scores, and longer latency from personally deciding to pursue surgery were associated with the reported need for immediate surgery. Conclusion: Overall, patients reported that they understood the need for elective surgical delays during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the psychological implications they reported were not negligible. Patient preference for immediate reengagement with the healthcare system was dichotomous, with many patients favoring precautionarily furthering the delay.

This approach begins by performing a morphological reconstruction operation that is useful to remove the effect of the external disturbances on the infected regions and to locate different regions of interest precisely. The optimal size of the structuring element is selected using the Edge Content-based contrast matrix approach. After performing the opening by using the morphological reconstruction operation, further noise is eliminated using the closing-based morphological reconstruction operation. The original pixel space is restored and the obtained image is divided into some non-overlapping smaller blocks and the mean intensity value for each block is computed that is used as the local threshold value for the binarization purpose. It is preferable to manually determine the range of the infected region. If a region is greater than the upper bound then that region will be considered as an exceptional region and processed separately. Three standard metrics MSE, PSNR, and SSIM are used to quantify the outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons prove the efficiency and real-life adaptability of this approach. The proposed approach is evaluated with the help of 400 different images and on average, the proposed approach achieves MSE 307.1888625, PSNR 23.7246505, and SSIM 0.831718459. Moreover, the comparative study shows that the proposed approach outperforms some of the standard methods and obtained results are encouraging to support the battle against the COVID-19.","output":"A morphology-based radiological image segmentation approach for efficient screening of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study investigated how students of the Faculties of Humanities and Education and Social Sciences at a Caribbean University sought information during the COVID-19 pandemic, identified challenges they experienced in seeking information for academic tasks and how satisfied they were with the Library's provision of electronic resources and services during this period. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey design was adopted for this study. Data were collected using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Findings: This study revealed that undergraduates relied upon lecture notes to complete assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undergraduate students have developed a definite information-seeking pattern, which did not change during the pandemic. They tend to use information channels that require the least effort. Postgraduate students used a variety of Library information channels but primarily used electronic journals. On the whole, students experienced challenges while seeking information via the channels provided by the Library. Students were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the Library's provision of electronic resources and services. Research limitations/implications: The study used non-probability sampling and only included students from two faculties at one university. As a result, the findings may not be generalized to the entire student population or all Caribbean universities. Practical implications: The results of this study can be used to identify the difficulties students are having in accessing information from the Library and gauge service delivery.

In this case report, we present two kidney transplant recipients and two hemodialysis patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received CP. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined sequentially by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay and specific cellular responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (&#8804;1:40). ELISpot responses in the four patients were either weak or absent. After CP treatment, we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific cellular responses.

OBJECTIVES: The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry aims to estimate the true impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment and outcome of patients with STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), with identification of at-risk patient cohorts for failure to present or delays to treatment. METHODS: This retrospective registry was performed in European high-volume PPCI centers and assessed patients with STEMI treated with PPPCI in March/April 2019 and 2020. Main outcomes are the incidences of PPCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6,609 patients underwent PPCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. In 2020, during the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in PPCI as compared with 2019 (incidence rate ratio: 0.811; 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 0.84; p < 0.0001). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19. A significant interaction was observed for patients with arterial hypertension, who were less frequently admitted in 2020 than in 2019. Furthermore, the pandemic was associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times, which may have contributed to the higher mortality during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a 19% reduction in PPCI procedures, especially among patients suffering from hypertension, and a longer delay to treatment, which may have contributed to the increased mortality during the pandemic.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD  16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.

Nowadays, plastic waste is one of the major issues human-faced worldwide. It is predicted to worsen due to the increment in online purchasing rising from the Covid-19 situations. On the other hand, the construction industry is the largest industry in different economies and the highest consumer of raw materials. Along with the growing demand for concrete aggregates, natural stone materials are overused and eventually deplete resources. Both severe problems can be mitigated by recycling these plastic wastes to serve as an alternative to aggregates in concrete. Despite accumulative efforts, the produced plastic waste aggregates (PWA) is still inferior in strengthening the concrete due to poor interaction between both particles. Therefore, steps to further improving their properties and compatibility with concrete through various approaches are crucial. This review briefly introduces the current situation of concrete industries and global plastic waste accumulation issues. The efforts in the utilization of plastic waste aggregates in concrete alongside their properties are also discussed. Lastly, the water-assisted melt compounding and advantages in the processing of thermoplastic composites are also presented to serve as the platform for a new processing approach to be utilized in PWA production.

Times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were described and turned into binary variables by the maximally selected rank statistics method. Then, survival analysis, including a log-rank test, Cox regression, and conditional inference tree (CTREE) was conducted, regarding whether patients progressed to a severe disease level during the observational period (assessed as severe pneumonia according to the Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Practice for Emergency Severe Pneumonia, admission to an intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, or death) as the prognosis outcome, the dependent variable. Independent factors included whether the time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was longer than 5 days (the exposure) and other demographic and clinical factors as multivariate adjustments. The clinical characteristics of the patients with different times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis were also compared. Results: The medians of the times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit, and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were 6, 3, and 2 days.

Next, a combined procedure using entropy and score function is proposed to estimate the criteria weights. To do this, a novel score function with its desirable properties and some entropy measures are introduced under the FFSs context. Further, an illustrative case study of the HCW disposal location selection problem on FFSs is established, which evidences the practicality and efficacy of the developed approach.

We use novel data on 900,000 firms in one Chinese province to document new facts about the structure of SI in China and evaluate payroll tax cuts as a COVID-19 relief measure. We calculate that labor informality causes 54% of tax-registered firms---representing 24% of aggregate economic activity---to receive no benefits. Labor formality also increases with firm size, further skewing the benefit of payroll tax cuts towards large firms.

The current work aimed to quantify the changes due to the lockdown in NOx, O3 and PM2.5 in two contrasting cities in India (Delhi and Hyderabad) using a boosted regression tree model to account for the influence of meteorology. The median NOx and PM2.5 concentrations were observed to decrease after lockdown in both cities, up to 57% and 75% for PM2.5 and NOx, respectively when compared to previous years. After normalization due to meteorology the calculated reduction after lockdown for PM2.5 was small (<8%) in both cities, and was likely less attributable to changes in local emissions, but rather due changes in background levels (i.e. regional source(s)). The reduction of NOx due to lockdown varied by site (on average 5-30%), likely reflecting differences in relative proximity of local sources to the monitoring site, demonstrating the key influence of meteorology on ambient levels post-lockdown. Ozone was observed to increase after lockdown at both sites in Delhi, likely due to changes in relative amounts of precursor concentrations promoting ozone production, suggesting a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime in Delhi. Thus, the calculated reduction in air pollutants due to lockdown in the current work cannot be extrapolated to be solely from a reduction in emissions and instead reflects the overall change in ambient levels, as meteorology and atmospheric chemical processes also contributed.","output":"Importance of meteorology and chemistry in determining air pollutant levels during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gained global attention.

Data from the same time period in 2019 was compiled for comparison.We compared the characteristics of 178 children presenting with new-onset type 1 diabetes between January and July 2020 (time period of interest) with those of 150 children who presented during the same period in 2019.ResultsThere was a statistically significant increase in the number of children with new-onset type 1 diabetes presenting with DKA in 2020 when compared to 2019 (79 versus 49, p <0.05). There was also an increase in the number of children presenting in severe DKA in 2020 when compared to 2019 (36 versus 16). The incidence of new onset type 1 diabetes from January to July 2020 was similar to the previous 4 years. An apparent increase in 2020 was noted in two units, who were both from inner city localities with a highly diverse ethnic mix. Association with COVID-19 could not be ascertained from the children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by NPA RT PCR and serology.In 2019 35% of children had symptoms of less than 2 weeks (of which 43% were in DKA),46% of children in 2020 presented with symptoms less than 2 weeks (of which 48% were in DKA). The short period of type 1 diabetes symptoms before presenting in DKA in 2020 does not suggest a delay in diagnosis.The short period of symptoms of type 1 diabetes at presentation during the study period and the severity of DKA raises the possibility that infection with SARS-CoVC2 may have been a trigger resulting in a rapid loss of -cells contributing to the rise in incidence and severity of DKA also accelerating the development of new-onset diabetes.ConclusionsThere was increased incidence and severity of DKA during the study period in 2020.Our study did not provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to a marked increase in incidence of pediatric type 1 diabetes.","output":"Characteristics of new-onset paediatric Type 1 diabetes in the COVID-19 pandemic C a multicentre perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context SARS-CoV-2 is a global public-health concern.

In March 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported all over Iraq. This study aims to represent data analysis, modelling and forecasting approaches to the presented data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODOLOGY: The project involves mathematical models for forecasting and artificial simulations using particles. In the study, time series models including Simple Exponential Model, Holt's Method and Brown's Models have been used for the forecasting of the future potential rates in the area. A series of simulations have been conducted to observe the possibilities of virus spread rates in a virtual world which represents a quarter of Erbil. RESULTS: The outcome of the study shows how the disease have spread in Kurdistan, and what are the current rates to compare with neighbour regions. The modelling clearly shows that with cases still sporadically appearing, the risk of second and third waves of infections is high. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the regional government must reduce unnecessary gatherings to the lowest possible level. A scientific registry system of disease statistics must be put in place and rigorously updated all the times. We recommend the officials use a nationwide database provided to the public to monitor movement of every infected individual, to prevent further spread.","output":"Time Series Modelling and Simulating the Lockdown Scenarios of COVID-19 in Kurdistan Region of Iraq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses from the Coronaviridae family affecting neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory systems.

We aim to describe rates and pathogens involved in co-infection or subsequent infections and their impact on clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods Incidence of and pathogens associated with co-infections, or subsequent infections, were analyzed in a multicenter observational cohort. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with a bacterial respiratory co-infection (BRC) and those without. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed evaluating survival. Results A total of 289 patients were included, 48 (16.6%) had any co-infection and 25 (8.7%) had a BRC. No significant differences in comorbidities were observed between patients with co-infection and those without. Compared to those without, patients with a BRC had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interleukin-6 levels. ICU admission (84.0 vs 31.8%), mechanical ventilation (72.0 vs 23.9%) and in-hospital mortality (45.0 vs 9.8%) were more common in patients with BRC compared to those without a co-infection. In Cox proportional hazards regression, following adjustment for age, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid administration, and pre-existing comorbidities, patients with BRC had an increased risk for in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.39 to 8.16; P = 0.007).

Non-urgent elective surgical cases have been cancelled, outpatient clinics have reduced and there has been a reduction in the number of patients presenting as an emergency. These factors will drastically affect the training opportunities of surgical trainees. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training globally. METHODS: The review was performed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF). Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. RESULTS: The searches identified 499 articles, 29 of which were included in the review. This contained data from more than 20 countries with 5260 trainees and 339 programme directors. Redeployment to non-surgical roles varied across studies from 6% to 35.1%. According to all of the studies, operative experience has been reduced. Knowledge learning had been switched to online platforms across 17 of the studies and 7 reported trainees had increased time to devote to educational/academic activities. All of the studies reporting on mental health report negative associations with increased stress, ranging from 54.9% to 91.6% of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on surgical trainees has been experienced globally and across all specialities. Negative effects are not limited to operative and clinical experience, but also the mental health and wellbeing of trainees. Delivery of surgical training will need to move away from traditional models of learning to ensure trainees are competent and well supported.

Immunological imprinting by CMV is not restricted to immunity against CMV itself, but can affect immunity against other viral or non-viral infectious agents and also immunopathological responses. One category is heterologous immunity based on molecular mimicry, where antigen recognition receptors specific for a CMV antigen with broad avidity distribution also bind with some avidity to unrelated antigens and exert effector functions against target structures other than those linked to CMV. Another category is induction of cytokines by CMV infection that inhibit or drive immune responses to bystander antigens unrelated to CMV, and a third category is the activation of antigen-presenting cells by CMV from which unrelated antigens profit as stowaways. A striking example of the stowaway category, actually one that is of medical importance, has been published recently and will be discussed here for the more general reader. Specifically, in a murine model, CMV airway infection and inhaled environmental antigen of poor intrinsic allergenic potential were found to sensitize for allergic airway disease (AAD) only when combined. As to the mechanism, viral activation of CD11b(+) conventional dendritic cells (CD11b(+) cDC) that localize to airway mucosa facilitates uptake and processing of inhaled antigen. Thus, CMV serves as a door opener for otherwise harmless environmental antigens that have no intrinsic property to activate DC. Antigen-laden CD11b(+) cDC migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they prime type-2 CD4(+) T helper (Th-2) cells. Upon airway re-exposure to the inhaled antigen, Th-2 cells secrete interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25) known to induce goblet cell metaplasia, the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD that is characterized by thickening of airway epithelia and increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells, resulting in enhanced mucus secretion and airflow obstruction.","output":"Adverse immunological imprinting by cytomegalovirus sensitizing for allergic airway disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current cross-cultural study examined the construct of workaholism across European and Asian cultures during the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Infected healthcare workers do not go back to work until RT-PCR has demonstrated that the virus is no longer present in the upper respiratory tract. The aim of this study is to determine the most efficient time to perform RT-PCR prior to healthcare workers reincorporation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected using the medical charts of healthcare workers and completed with a telephone interview. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine the influence of several variables on the time to RT-PCR negativisation. The impact of the variables on survival was assessed using the Breslow test. A Cox regression model was developed including the associated variables. RESULTS: 159 subjects with a positive RT-PCR out of 374 workers with suspected COVID-19 were included. The median time to negativisation was 25 days from symptom onset (IQR 20C35 days). Presence of IgG, dyspnoea, cough and throat pain were associated with significant longer time to negativisation. Cox logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. Only dyspnoea and cough remained in the model as significant determinants of prolonged negativisation time. Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (0.48C096) for dyspnoea and 0.61 (0.42C0.88) for dry cough. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR during the first 3 weeks leads to a high percentage of positive results. In the presence of respiratory symptoms, negativisation took nearly 1 week more.

We measured the messages effects on participants self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about others intentions, impressions of the messengers morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianismimpartial concern for the greater goodwere strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US.

The high mortality rate of COVID-19 is associated with age, gender and the presence of comorbidities. Biochemical data have shown that COVID-19 patients develop a local and systemic hyper-inflammatory response associated with poor outcome. Therefore, the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is a compelling need. Following this reasoning, here we will focus on the importance of the progressive age-related development of a pro-inflammatory state (aka inflamm-aging) in the understanding of the unbalanced inflammatory response against SARS-CoV-2 in aged people. In particular, we underpin the role of mitochondrial DNA and genomic DNA telomeric sequences in local and systemic mechanisms of inflammation. Indeed, the leakage of mtDNA out of its natural compartment (i.e. the mitochondrion), into the cytoplasm and in the extracellular environment is a powerful trigger of innate immunity and inflammation, as part of an evolutionary-conserved signaling mechanism of cellular damage (e.g. viral infection). High levels of circulating mtDNA are increased in aged people and set up as inflammatory markers of poor prognosis in intensive care unit patients. In turn, telomeric DNA, which can be released into the cytoplasm and in the extracellular environment upon cell damage, has been proven to exert potent anti-inflammatory activity. Since that aged people (particularly those affected by co-morbidity) are equipped with shortened telomeres, we posit that, in aged people affected by COVID-19 the release of mtDNA, coupled with insufficient telomeric DNA favors the onset of a detrimental inflammatory response. In this regard, we highlight that the mechanism of action of some currently used drugs, as well as potential new ones may be better understood under the light of the above-depicted theoretical framework thus explaining how studies on inflamm-aging may help to understand and combat COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"How studies on inflamm-aging may help to understand and combat COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide.

Walking Blood Banks (WBB) provide fresh whole blood (FWB) where conventional blood components or stored, tested WB are not readily available. There is an increasing interest in this as an emergency resilience measure for isolated communities and during crises including the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to inform practice. METHODS Standard systematic review methodology was used to obtain studies that reported the delivery of FWB (PROSPERO registry CRD42019153849). Studies that only reported WB from conventional blood banking were excluded. For outcomes, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects modelling due to high risk of heterogeneity. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS 27 studies published from 2006 - 2020 reported >10,000 units of FWB for >3000 patients (precise values not available for all studies). Evidence for studies was \\"low\\" or \\"very low\\" except for one study which was \\"moderate\\" in quality. FWB patients were more severely injured than non-FWB patients. Overall, survival was equivalent between FWB and non-FWB groups for 8 studies that compared these (OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.65, 1.55); p=0.61). However, the highest quality study (matched groups for physiological and injury characteristics) reported an adjusted OR of 0.27 (95% CI 0.13-0.58) for mortality for the FWB group; p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS Thousands of units of FWB from WBBs have been transfused in patients following life-threatening haemorrhage. Survival is equivalent for FWB resuscitation when compared to non-FWB, even when patients were more severely injured.

The objective of the study was to explore the barriers and facilitators of access to MNCH services during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted among different stakeholder groups in 18 public health facilities in Nigeria between May and July,2020. In-depth interviews were conducted among 54 study participants (service users, service providers and policymakers) selected from across the three tiers of public health service delivery system in Nigeria (primary health centers, secondary health centers and tertiary health centers). Coding of the qualitative data and identification of themes from the transcripts were carried out and thematic approach was used for data analyses. RESULTS: Barriers to accessing MNCH services during the first wave of COVID-19-pandemic in Nigeria include fear of contracting COVID-19 infection at health facilities, transportation difficulties, stigmatization of sick persons, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) /medical commodities, long waiting times at hospitals, shortage of manpower, lack of preparedness by health workers, and prioritization of essential services. Enablers to access include the COVID-19 non-pharmacological measures instituted at the health facilities, community sensitization on healthcare access during the pandemic, and alternative strategies for administering immunization service at the clinics. CONCLUSION: Access to MNCH services were negatively affected by lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria particularly due to challenges resulting from restrictions in movements which affected patients/healthcare providers ability to reach the hospitals as well as patients ability to pay for health care services. Additionally, there was fear of contracting COVID-19 infection at health facilities and the health systems inability to provide enabling conditions for sustained utilization of MNCH services. There is need for government to institute alternative measures to halt the spread of diseases instead of lockdowns so as to ensure unhindered access to MNCH services during future pandemics. This may include immediate sensitization of the general public on modes of transmission of any emergent infectious disease as well as training of health workers on emergency preparedness and alternative service delivery models.

Given the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19, understanding the factors that can predict disease severity will be essential since this will help frontline clinical staff to stratify patients with increased confidence. Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value of the temporal radiographic changes, and the relationship to disease severity and viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : In this retrospective cohort study, we included 99 patients admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, with laboratory confirmed moderate or severe COVID-19. Temporal radiographic changes and viral clearance were explored using appropriate statistical methods. Results: : Radiographic features from HRCT scans included ground-glass opacity, consolidation, air bronchogram, nodular opacities and pleural effusion. The HRCT scores (peak) during disease course in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia (median: 24.5) were higher compared to those with pneumonia (median: 10) (p=3.5610 -12 ), with more frequency of consolidation (p=0.025) and air bronchogram (p=7.5010 -6 ). The median values of days when the peak HRCT scores were reached in pneumonia or severe pneumonia patients were 12 vs . 14, respectively (p=0.048). Log-rank test and Spearman's Rank-Order correlation suggested temporal radiographic changes as a valuable predictor for viral clearance. In addition, follow up CT scans from 11 pneumonia patients showed full recovery.

During 21 days, nutrition and exercise were daily monitored, and the mood states assessed. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of nutritional variables collected. The relationships between exercise, mood and nutrition were investigated using a multivariate general linear model and a mediation model. Seven factors were found, reflecting different nutritional choices. Exercise was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and fish consumption (p = 0.004). Depression and quality of life were, directly and inversely, associated with cereals, legumes (p = 0.005; p = 0.004) and low-fat meat intake (p = 0.040; p = 0.004). Exercise mediated the effect of mood states on fruit, vegetables and fish consumption, respectively, accounting for 4.2% and 1.8% of the total variance.

A continual release mechanism receives a sensitive dataset as a stream of $T$ inputs and produces, after receiving each input, an accurate output on the obtained inputs. In contrast, a batch algorithm receives the data as one batch and produces a single output. We provide the first strong lower bounds on the error of continual release mechanisms. In particular, for two fundamental problems that are widely studied and used in the batch model, we show that the worst case error of every continual release algorithm is $\\\\tilde \\\\Omega(T^{1/3})$ times larger than that of the best batch algorithm. Previous work shows only a polylogarithimic (in $T$) gap between the worst case error achievable in these two models; further, for many problems, including the summation of binary attributes, the polylogarithmic gap is tight (Dwork et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2010). Our results show that problems closely related to summation -- specifically, those that require selecting the largest of a set of sums -- are fundamentally harder in the continual release model than in the batch model.

However, the mechanisms underpinning ACE2-mediated viral entry across species remains unclear. Using infection assay, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different animal species. We discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (wild pig), Capra hircus (goat) and Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) facilitated SARS-CoV-2 entry into nonsusceptible cells. Moreover, ACE2 of the pangolin also mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry, adding credence to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from pangolins. However, the ACE2 proteins of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (red junglefowl), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), or Mus musculus (house mouse) did not facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. In addition, a natural isoform of the ACE2 protein of Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey) with the Y217N mutation was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the possible impact of this ACE2 mutation on SARS-CoV-2 studies in rhesus monkeys. We further demonstrated that the Y217 residue of ACE2 is a critical determinant for the ability of ACE2 to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry.

METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental, retrospective cohort study of ACS hospitalisations by using a multi-institutional administrative claims database in Japan. We used interrupted time series analyses to ascertain impacts on cases, treatment approaches, and in-hospital mortality before and after Japan's state of emergency to respond to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the change in ACS cases per week. RESULTS: A total of 30,198 ACS cases (including 21,612 acute myocardial infarction and 8,586 unstable angina) were confirmed between 1st July 2018 and 30th June 2020. After the state of emergency, an immediate decrease was observed in ACS cases per week (-18.3%; 95% confidence interval, -13.1 to -23.5%).

This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the \\"wrong virus\\" at the \\"wrong time\\"). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

We conducted a review to identify whether there have been age-restrictive inclusion criteria in clinical trials over the last twenty five years, focusing on patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer. METHODS A search strategy was developed encompassing Embase, PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases. Completed phase III randomised controlled trials evaluating systemic anti-cancer therapies in metastatic gastroesophageal malignancies from 1st January 1995 to 18th November 2020 were identified. These were screened for eligibility using reference management software (Covidence; Veritas Health Innovation Ltd). Data including age inclusion/exclusion criteria and median age of participants were recorded. The percentage of patients  65 enrolled was collected where available. The change over time in the proportion of studies using an upper age exclusion was estimated using a linear probability model. RESULTS Three hundred sixty-three phase III studies were identified and screened, with 66 trials remaining for final analysis. The majority of trials were Asian (48%; n = 32) and predominantly evaluated gastric malignancies, (86%; n = 56). The median age of participants was 62 (range 18-94). Thirty-two percent (n = 21) of studies specified an upper age limit for inclusion and over half of these were Asian studies. The median age of exclusion was 75 (range 65-80). All studies prior to 2003 used an upper age exclusion (n = 12); whereas only 9 that started in 2003 or later did (17%). Among later studies, there was a very modest downward yearly-trend in the proportion of studies using an upper age exclusion (-0.02 per year; 95%CI -0.05 to 0.01; p = 0.31). Fifty-two percent (n = 34) of studies specified the proportion of their study population who were  65 years. Older patients represented only 36% of the trial populations in these studies (range 7-60%). CONCLUSIONS Recent years have seen improvements in clinical trial protocols, with many no longer specifying restrictive age criteria.

The average number of secondary transmissions from an infected person, or reproduction numbers (R0 and R), and the points at which the collective immunity begins to reduce the transmission of the infection, or herd immunity thresholds, are important epidemiological tools used in strategies of Covid-19 control, suppression, and mitigation. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through asymptomatic carriers and, possibly, aerosols, has been ignored, and this may affect the effectiveness of Covid-19 control strategies. Therefore, consideration of the two possible ways of transmission would substantially increase the values of reproduction numbers, but if estimates of the contingent of the population naturally resistant to the virus, plus those with pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 were considered, the evaluation of herd immunity thresholds should reach their real and achievable levels.","output":"Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through asymptomatic carriers and aerosols: A major public health challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unknown","output":"Appendix A Emergency Preparedness, Response & Recovery Checklist Beyond the Emergency Management Plan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In May 2021, the number of new COVID-19 patients in India began to decline, as predicted by the generalized SIR-model (susceptible-infected-removed).

Non-drug patient-centred care is the first-line treatment, but there is a need for other treatment when this care is not effective. Current evidence is sparse on safer and effective alternatives to antipsychotics. We assessed the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine, an antidepressant prescribed for agitation in dementia. METHODS: This parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trialthe Study of Mirtazapine for Agitated Behaviours in Dementia trial (SYMBAD)was done in 26 UK centres. Participants had probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, agitation unresponsive to non-drug treatment, and a Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score of 45 or more. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either mirtazapine (titrated to 45 mg) or placebo. The primary outcome was reduction in CMAI score at 12 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03031184, and ISRCTN17411897. FINDINGS: Between Jan 26, 2017, and March 6, 2020, 204 participants were recruited and randomised. Mean CMAI scores at 12 weeks were not significantly different between participants receiving mirtazapine and participants receiving placebo (adjusted mean difference C174, 95% CI C717 to 369; p=053). The number of controls with adverse events (65 [64%] of 102 controls) was similar to that in the mirtazapine group (67 [66%] of 102 participants receiving mirtazapine). However, there were more deaths in the mirtazapine group (n=7) by week 16 than in the control group (n=1), with post-hoc analysis suggesting this difference was of marginal statistical significance (p=0065). INTERPRETATION: This trial found no benefit of mirtazapine compared with placebo, and we observed a potentially higher mortality with use of mirtazapine. The data from this study do not support using mirtazapine as a treatment for agitation in dementia.

DESIGN: descriptive analysis of total and cause-specific mortality in 2020 in Rome and comparison with a reference period (2015-2018 for total mortality and 2018 for cause-specific mortality); descriptive analysis of cause-specific mortality in the cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 27,471 deaths registered in the Lazio mortality-cause Registry, relating to people residing and died in the municipality of Rome in 2020, 2,374 of which died from COVID-19.MAIN OUCOME MEASURES: all-cause mortality by month, gender, age group and place of death, cause-specific mortality (ICD-10 codes). RESULTS: in the municipality of Rome in 2020, an excess of mortality from all causes equal to +10% was observed, with a greater increase in the months of October-December (+27%, +56%, and +26%, respectively) in people aged 50+, with the greatest contribution from the oldest age groups (80+) who died in the nursing homes or at home. Lower mortality was observed in the age groups 0-29 years (-30%) and 40-49 years (-13%). In 2020, COVID-19 represents the fourth cause of death in Rome after malignant tumours, diseases of the circulatory system, and respiratory diseases. Excess mortality was observed from stroke and pneumonia (both in men and women), from respiratory diseases (in men), from diabetes, mental disorders, dementia and Parkinson's disease (in women). On the contrary, mortality is lower for all cancers, for diseases of the blood and haematopoietic organs and for the causes of the circulatory system. The follow-up analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects residing in Rome shows that a share of deaths (about 20%) reports other causes of death such as cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumours, and diseases of the respiratory system on the certificate collected by the Italian National Statistics Institute. CONCLUSIONS: the 2020 mortality study highlighted excesses for acute and chronic pathologies, indicative of possible delays in the diagnosis or treatment of conditions indirectly caused by the pandemic, but also a share of misclassification of the cause of death that is recognized as COVID-19 death.","output":"[Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on total and cause-specific mortality in Rome (Italy) in 2020]./ Impatto dell'epidemia di COVID-19 sulla mortalit totale e per causa a Roma nel 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinia virus (VACV) is an enveloped DNA virus from the Orthopoxvirus family, various strains of which were used in the successful eradication campaign against smallpox.

The resulting high renal radiation dose can cause nephrotoxicity, limiting the maximum activity dose and the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. The mechanisms of kidney reabsorption of these peptides are incompletely understood, but the scavenger receptor megalin has been shown to play a role in the reabsorption of (111)In-octreotide. In this study, the role of megalin in the renal reabsorption of various relevant radiolabelled peptides was investigated. METHODS Groups of kidney-specific megalin-deficient mice and wild-type mice were injected with (111)In-labelled somatostatin, exendin, neurotensin or minigastrin analogues. Single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images of the kidneys were acquired and analysed quantitatively, or the animals were killed 3 h after injection and the activity concentration in the kidneys was measured. RESULTS Megalin-deficient mice showed significantly lower uptake of all studied radiolabelled peptides in the kidneys, ranging from 22% ((111)In-octreotide) to 65% ((111)In-exendin) of uptake in wild-type kidneys. Quantitative analysis of renal uptake by SPECT and ex vivo measurements showed a very good correlation. CONCLUSION Megalin is involved in the renal reabsorption of radiolabelled octreotide, octreotate, exendin, neurotensin and minigastrin. This knowledge may help in the design of strategies to reduce this reabsorption and the resulting nephrotoxicity in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, enabling more effective therapy.

In addition, not all individuals are infected despite exposure. Risk factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities play a major role in this variability; however, genetics may also be important in driving the differences in the incidence and prognosis of the disease. An Insertion/Deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE1 gene (rs1799752) may explain these genetic differences. The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of ACE1 I/D genetic polymorphism in the risk of contracting COVID-19 as well as predicting the severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Three-hundred and eighty-seven non-related Lebanese subjects, 155 controls and 232 cases, who presented to the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) for COVID-19 PCR testing were recruited. Clinical data were collected via filling a questionnaire and accessing the medical records. Peripheral blood was withdrawn for DNA isolation, and genotyping performed with standard PCR followed by band visualization on agarose gel. Results: In our study population, previously described risk factors such as gender, age, and comorbidities were associated with increase in disease susceptibility and severity. ACE1 I was the least common allele, and there was a positive association between ACE1 I and the risk of contracting the COVID-19 disease. More specifically, the frequency of II genotype was significantly higher among cases when compared to controls (P = 0.035) with individuals with the II genotype having greater risk for contracting the COVID-19 disease: OR = 2.074, P = 0.048 in the multivariate analysis. As for disease severity, the  genotype and D allele were associated with increased risk for developing severe symptoms (OR = 2.845, P = 0.026 and OR = 2.359, P = 0.014, respectively), and the  genotype with necessitating hospitalization (OR = 2.307, P = 0.042).

Conclusion: We found a positive association between ACE1 I and the risk of contracting the COVID-19 disease, and between ACE1 D and a worse outcome of the COVID-19 infection.

For example, As and V are mainly associated to particles with mean diameters between 15.6 and 63 m and settling rates around 96 m d-1. Overall, all the main elements (Mg, Al, Ca, S) composing concretions are associated to this size class of particles which represents 53-60% of the total concretion mass.","output":"Characterization of the submarine disposal of a Bayer effluent (Gardanne alumina plant, southern France): I.

We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory findings of patients in Saudi Arabia infected with SARS-CoV-2 to direct us in helping prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across Saudi Arabia and around the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric and adult patients in five hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were surveyed in this study. RESULTS: 401 patients (mean age 38.16  13.43 years) were identified to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and 80% of cases were male. 160 patients had moderate severity and 241 were mild in severity. The most common signs and symptoms at presentation were cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin were higher in the COVID-19 moderate severity patient group. Mild severity patients spent a shorter duration hospitalized and had slightly higher percentages of abnormal CT scans and X-ray imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an understanding of the features of non-ICU COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia.

To fill this gap, the clinical performance of a point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Assay, a chromatographic immunoassay for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies, in near-patient settings was assessed. METHODS: 42 Anti-SARS-Cov-2 positive (CoV+) and 92 Anti-SARS-Covid-2 negative (CoV-) leftover samples from before December 2019 were assessed, using the Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 as the reference assay. Analytical specificity was tested using leftover samples collected before December 2019 from patients with common cold symptoms. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test was 100.0% (95% CI 91.59C100.00) sensitive and 96.74% (95% CI 90.77C99.32) specific, with 0.00% assay failure rate. No cross-reactivity was observed against the common cold panel. Method comparison was additionally conducted by two external laboratories, using 100 CoV+/275 CoV- samples, also comparing whole blood versus plasma matrix. The comparison demonstrated 96.00% positive/96.36% negative percent agreement for plasma with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and 99.20% percent overall agreement between whole blood and EDTA plasma.

The predictive value of POLDs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been evaluated until now. Patients and Methods A total of 369 hepatocellular carcinoma samples and 50 adjacent normal samples were enrolled from the TCGA-LIHC database, and the GSE10186 database was also used. Transcription, methylation and genetic alteration status of HCC patients were evaluated by GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, MethHC, MethSurv. SurvExpress was employed to generate the overall prognosis prediction signature of POLDs. POLDs coexpressed genes were explored and enriched in potential pathways. K-M curves were generated to compare the different survival results in different groups, while ROC curves were used to validate the efficiency of the POLD signature. Results All four POLD subunits were highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues. POLD1-3 and increased mRNA levels were also positively associated with advanced tumor stage and OS prognosis. Methylation in the promoter of POLDs affects mRNA expression and OS, especially for some specific CpG sites. Meanwhile, POLDs could preferably predict the prognosis for patients who suffered from a high gene mutation burden. We evaluated the combined prognostic predictive value of four POLD subunits in both the TCGA-LIHC and GSE10186 databases and recognized the statistically significant HR of the high-risk group, along with the reliable predictive value. The coexpressed gene sets and annotation results showed that the POLD coexpressed genes were mostly associated with DNA repair and cell cycle regulation pathways. Conclusion POLD is an essential predictive factor for the prognosis of HCC.

The dynamical intertwining of many heterogeneous operational elements, agents and locations are oft-cited generic factors to make these systems prone to large-scale disruptions: initially localised perturbations amplify and spread over the network, leading to a complete standstill of transport. Our level of understanding of such phenomena, let alone the ability to anticipate or predict their evolution in time, remains rudimentary. We approach the problem with a prime example: railways. Analysing spreading of train delays on the network by building a physical model, supported by data, reveals that the emergence of large-scale disruptions rests on the dynamic interdependencies among multiple 'layers' of operational elements (resources and services). The interdependencies provide pathways for the so-called delay cascading mechanism, which gets activated when, constrained by local unavailability of on-time resources, already-delayed ones are used to operate new services. Cascading locally amplifies delays, which in turn get transported over the network to give rise to new constraints elsewhere. This mechanism is a rich addition to some well-understood ones in, e.g., epidemiological spreading, or the spreading of rumours and opinions over (contact) networks, and stimulates rethinking spreading dynamics on complex networks. Having these concepts built into the model provides it with the ability to predict the evolution of large-scale disruptions in the railways up to 30-60 minutes up front. For transport systems, our work suggests that possible alleviation of constraints as well as a modular operational approach would arrest cascading, and therefore be effective measures against large-scale disruptions.","output":"Cascading dominates large-scale disruptions in transport over complex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within a cluster of Navy personnel in Sri Lanka commencing from 22nd April 2020, an aggressive outbreak management program was launched by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health.

A physical threat monitoring solution unifying the floorplan, cameras, and sensors for smart buildings has been set up in our study. Computer vision and deep learning models are used for video streams analysis. When a threat is detected by a rule engine based on the real-time analysis results combining with feedback from related digital sensors, an alert is sent to the Video Management System so that human operators can take further action. A physical threat monitoring system typically needs to address complex and even destructive incidents, such as fire, which is unrealistic to simulate in real life. Restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and privacy concerns have added to the challenges. Our study utilises the Unreal Engine to simulate some typical suspicious and intrusion scenes with photorealistic qualities in the context of a virtual building. Add-on programs are implemented to transfer the video stream from virtual PTZ cameras to the Milestone Video Management System and enable users to control those cameras from the graphic client application. Virtual sensors such as fire alarms, temperature sensors and door access controls are implemented similarly, fulfilling the same programmatic VMS interface as real-life sensors. Thanks to this simulation system's extensibility and repeatability, we have consolidated this unified physical threat monitoring system and verified its effectiveness and user-friendliness.

Inborn genetic flaws and autoreactive antibodies that block IFN response have been significantly associated with about 14% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In most severe COVID-19 patients without genetic errors in IFN-relevant gene loci, IFN dysregulation is progressively worsened and associated with the situation of pro-inflammation and immunopathy, which is prone to autoimmunity.

Smell impairment affects physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. Objective: To characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. Settings, Participants: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function, and COVID-19 diagnosis survey (S1) between April and September 2020 and completed a follow-up survey (S2) between September 2020 and February 2021; 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. Main Outcomes & Measures: Primary outcomes are ratings of smell and taste function on a visual analog scale, and self-report of parosmia (smell distortions) and phantosmia (unexplained smells). Secondary outcomes include a checklist of other COVID-19 symptoms. Results: On follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID. During COVID-19 illness, the ability to smell was slightly lower among those who did not recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. Conclusions and Relevance: While smell loss improves for many individuals who lost it due to COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with wider COVID-19 symptoms and may persist for many months after COVID-19 onset. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19.

However, there lacks empirical evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in child mental health and associated factors. METHODS: We conducted a population-based online survey in 21,526 children in China, when children were confined at home for nearly two months during the pandemic. We assessed child mental health problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental education level and provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were treated as proxies for individual- and population-level socioeconomic status (SES), respectively. Lifestyle and family environment factors included sleep disturbances, physical activity, screen time, primary caregiver, parental mental health, and harsh parenting. RESULTS: Of the children, 32.31% demonstrated mental health problems. Parental education from the highest (undergraduate and above) to the lowest (middle school and below) increased the adjusted odds ratio(aOR) for child mental health problems by 42% (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57); provincial GDP per capita (RMB) from the highest (>100K) to the lowest (&#8804;70K) increased aOR by 41% (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI%, 1.28-1.55). Sleep disturbances, physical activity <1 h/day, media exposure &#8805;2 h/day, non-parental care, poor parental mental health, and harsh parenting were independently associated with increased child mental health problems, regardless of SES. LIMITATIONS: The potential sampling bias, subjective measures, and the cross-sectional design are the main limitations.

Measurement of this burden changed substantially over the first months, as surveillance was expanded to accommodate the escalating epidemic. Laboratory confirmation was initially restricted to clinical need (pillar 1) before expanding to community-wide symptomatics (pillar 2). This study aimed to ascertain whether inconsistent measurement of case data resulting from varying testing coverage could be reconciled by drawing inference from COVID-19-related deaths. MethodsWe fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to weekly COVID-19-related deaths per local authority (LTLA) throughout the first wave (1 January - 30 June 2020), adjusting for the local epidemic timing and the age, deprivation and ethnic composition of its population. We combined predictions from this model with case data under community-wide, symptomatic testing and infection prevalence estimates from the ONS infection survey, to infer the likely trajectory of infections implied by the deaths in each LTLA.ResultsA model including temporally- and spatially-correlated random effects was found to best accommodate the observed variation in COVID-19-related deaths, after accounting for local population characteristics. Predicted case counts under community-wide symptomatic testing suggest a total of 275,000-420,000 cases over the first wave - a median of over 100,000 additional to the total confirmed in practice under varying testing coverage. This translates to a peak incidence of around 200,000 total infections per week across England. The extent to which estimated total infections are reflected in confirmed case counts was found to vary substantially across LTLAs, ranging from 7% in Leicester to 96% in Gloucester with a median of 23%. ConclusionsLimitations in testing capacity biased the observed trajectory of COVID-19 infections throughout the first wave. Basing inference on COVID-19-related mortality and higher-coverage testing later in the time period, we could explore the extent of this bias more explicitly. Evidence points towards substantial under-representation of initial growth and peak magnitude of infections nationally, to which different parts of the country contribute unequally.","output":"Estimating the Local Burden of Disease During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in England, Using Different Data Sources from Changing Surveillance Practices (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the new millennium, the centuries-old strategy of quarantine is becoming a powerful component of the public health response to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVE To compare treatment of unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms with a dual-microcatheter technique (DMT) versus SAC. METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 100 patients with unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with DMT and 160 with SAC. Over time there was a significant decrease in the use of SAC and a corresponding increase in DMT. The investigators matched 60 patients treated with DMT blinded to outcome in a 1:2 fashion based on maximal aneurysm dome diameter with 120 patients treated with SAC. Outcomes were determined with conditional (matched) multivariate analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient or aneurysm characteristics between cohorts, including aneurysm diameter, neck width, or volume. Overall packing density and coil volume achieved was not significantly different between cohorts. There were higher rates of overall complications in those receiving SAC (19.2%) compared with DMT (5.0%; p=0.012), but no significant difference in major complications (8.3% vs 1.7%, respectively; p=0.103). At a mean follow-up of 27.0  18.9 months, rates of retreatment did not differ between DMT (15.1%) and SAC (17.7%). Delayed in-stent stenosis occurred in five patients and in-stent thrombosis in four patients treated with SAC.

However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved.

Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers &#8805;160 within 100 days after the onset of disease, there was >75% probability of sustaining nAb titers &#8805;160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was &#8805;1280, weight &#8805; 90 kg or obese, according to their body mass index (BMI), as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox hazard regression (all p < .02). There was no correlation between the ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers. High IgG anti-NP (S/CO &#8805;5.0) is a good surrogate for detecting nAb &#8805; 160, defined by the ROC curve (sensitivity = 90.5%; CI95%: 84.5%-94.7%). CONCLUSION: Selection of CCP donors for multiple collections based on initial high nAb titers (&#8805;1280) or BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 provides a simple strategy to achieve higher quality in CCP programs. High IgG anti-NP levels can also be used as surrogate markers for high nAb screening.","output":"A longitudinal study of convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and correlation of ABO group, initial neutralizing antibodies (nAb), and body mass index (BMI) with nAb and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics: Proposals for better quality of CCP collections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management thinking today, based in neoliberalism, gears economies, businesses, and whole societies toward constant material growth and achievement of wealth, defined as monetary or financial wealth In terms of management learning, the dominance of the managerialist/capitalist ideology reinforces existing dominance structures that have long suppressed the voice?and values?of Indigenous peoples Drawing from work by Indigenous scholars, we focus on the Indigenous wisdom which has the potential to offer a very different form of economy and different sets of managerial values that orient businesses and other institutions towards fostering relationship, responsibility, reciprocity and redistribution for shared wellbeing Perspectives from Indigenous wisdom can push focus away from today?s neoliberalism and ?(hu)man?-dominating-nature mindsets, evident in Western cultures, towards more holistically integrated approaches In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, we argue for a pivot towards recognizing, collaborating with, integrating, and renewing management and business school mindsets by incorporating Indigenous wisdom to build a world in which all?including non-human beings?can flourish","output":"Invoking indigenous wisdom for management learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, child welfare case managers faced contradictions in their responsibility to make regular in-person contact with children and families to promote safety, permanency, and well-being while following public health directives to avoid social contact in order to curb COVID-19 infections. In response, federal guidance was issued regarding the use of technology to maintain mandated contacts with children in foster care. States had to make decisions about how to handle other contact types. This study reviewed documentation of state child welfare agency practices regarding face-to-face contact between case managers and child-welfare involved families between March 2020 and May 2020. Using a point-in-time search to obtain publicly accessible documents related to caseworker face-to-face contact and COVID-19, data was located for 49 states and the District of Columbia (n = 50). Documents were analyzed in NVIVO 12 using document analysis. Within the context of face-to-face interactions by child welfare case managers, documents were analyzed in six themes based on the types of services provided to children and families: (1) investigations, (2) family preservation, (3) family team meetings, (4) foster care, (5) adoption, and (6) general child welfare. State decisions about how to manage these contacts varied. In several states case managers were directed to document both virtual and in-person contacts during this time as face-to-face; which may impact future evaluations of child welfare systems during COVID-19. Findings highlight a range of strategies used by state child welfare systems.

When health care was resumed, video consultation was used as a new solution to continue consultations with the new governmental rules of social distancing. Prior to this COVID-19 situation, video consultation was not used extensively in the Netherlands; therefore, physicians and patients are not familiar with this way of consultation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to measure the level of patient centeredness and shared decision making in infertile couples who have undergone fertility workup through video consultation. METHODS: This is a questionnaire study with an additional qualitative part for a more in depth understanding. Infertile couples (ie, male and female partners with an unfulfilled wish for a child after 1 year of unprotected intercourse) were referred to a fertility center and underwent fertility workup through video consultation. The fertility workup consisted of 2 separate video consultations, with diagnostic tests according to a protocol. After the last video consultation couples received a digital questionnaire, which consisted of a modified version of the Patient-Centered Questionnaire-Infertility (PCQ-I) and CollaboRATE questionnaire. Fifty-three eligible infertile couples were approached, and of these, 22 participated. Four women were approached for a semistructured interview. RESULTS: The median score on the modified PCQ-I (scale of 0 to 3) was 2.64. The highest rating was for the subscale communication and information, and the lowest rating was for the subscale organization of care. The median score on the CollaboRATE questionnaire (scale of 1 to 9) was 8 for all 3 subquestions. Patients mentioned privacy, less travel time, and easy use of the program as possible benefits of video consultation. However, patients preferred the first consultation with their physician to be face-to-face consultation as video consultation was considered less personal. CONCLUSIONS: The high levels of patient centeredness and shared decision making show that video consultation is a promising way of providing care remotely, although attention has to be payed to mitigate the more impersonal setting of video consultation when compared with face-to-face consultation.","output":"Fertility Workup With Video Consultation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Pilot Quantitative and Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Happiness at work is a consolidated topic.

To this end, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of PR professionals in Spain (N = 256). The questionnaire consisted of the PERMA-profiler, a model where work relationships, engagement, positive affections/emotions, vital sense/purpose and achievements are measured. The results show a remarkable level of happiness among surveyed professionals, especially among women, who obtained higher scores on all five factors, although with a statistically significant difference only in two of the five factors in PERMA (Engagement and Relationships).

There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.

Now, it has spread to over 200 countries. COVID 19-associated respiratory syndrome is causing a lot of mortality and morbidity. There are reports suggesting that the complications and ARDS associated with COVID 19 is an immune response reaction. The cytokine storm associated with severe cases of COVID 19 acts as a cause of death in many sick patients. It has been shown that COVID 19 is associated with a peculiar immune profile: Decrease in CD3, CD4, CD8, natural killer cell and B-cells; Rise in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; Decrease in IL-10; Decrease in interferon-gamma. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) immunosuppressive features resulting from M2 macrophage phenotype activation, increase in IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, a decrease in IL-6, TNF alpha and an increase in CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell counts may negate the harmful effects of cytokine release syndrome. Literature review shows that radiation was previously used to treat viral pneumonia with a good success rate. This practice was discontinued in view of the availability of effective antibiotics and antivirals. As there are no scientifically proven treatment for severe COVID 19-associated respiratory distress today, it is prudent that we understand the benefits of LDRT at this critical juncture and take rational decisions to treat the same.

Clues to the existence of this system stem from observations that respiratory infections are often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, whereby intestinal microbiota appear to play pivotal roles in combating pathogenic infections. Importantly, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota appear to serve as the biological link between host immune defenses and gut flora. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pn), the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections, is involved in more than 1.189 million deaths per year. QingFei Yin (QFY) is known for its excellent therapeutic efficacy in combating bacterial lung infections. In this study, effects of S.pn infection on gut homeostasis were assessed using 16S RNA-based microbiota community profiling analysis. In addition, potential mechanisms underlying QFY recipe beneficial therapeutic effects against bacterial pneumonia were explored using S.pn-infected gut microbiota-depleted mice. Results of data analysis indicated that QFY treatment alleviated lung infection-associated pathogenic processes, while also promoting repair of disordered gut flora and counteracting S.pn infection-associated decreases in levels of SCFAs, particularly of acetate and butyrate. Mechanistically, QFY treatment suppressed inflammatory lung injury through inhibition of the host NF-B-NLRP3 pathway. These results inspired us to identify precise QFY targets and mechanisms underlying QFY anti-inflammatory effects.

This study explored the perception of the adult population about the need for-and access to-psychological support from health care professionals (HCP) in response to concerns about the psychological needs during lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This online cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the adult general population of mainland France (N = 2,003) took place during the last four days of the French lockdown (May 7-10, 2020). RESULTS: One in eight respondents (12.2%) perceived a need for psychological support from an HCP during the lockdown; most had symptoms of depression and/or anxiety of at least moderate intensity. Only a third (29.8%, 3.6% of the entire sample) actually obtained this support. Factors associated with this perceived need included: age under 35, economic difficulties due to lockdown, pre-lockdown use of psychological support, infection with COVID-19, serious worries about becoming infected, and heavy media use to obtain information about the disease. Among those who perceived a need for psychological support, the elderly were the most likely not to consult an HCP. People aged 35-64, those with high income, and those seriously worried about developing COVID-19 were the most likely to forgo seeking access to care because of their fear of infection by the coronavirus-2019. CONCLUSION: The perceived need for psychological support from an HCP and access to it appeared to be strongly associated with COVID-19 exposure factor. More research about this association is needed to improve the health authorities' understanding of the population's psychological needs in this situation and to enhance HCPs' abilities to meet them. In particular, further research of its specific impact on youth is necessary.","output":"Psychological support in general population during the COVID-19 lockdown in France: Needs and access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to discuss whether fair value accounting fits for long-term equity investments, which are considered key to retool economies according to sustainability criteria.

Transport-related mortality will increase as a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, air pollution and sedentary lifestyles. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) have proven to be a successful tool to predict and mitigate negative health impact of urban transport planning policies, programmes or projects. Yet, there is a gap of evidence on transport and health in African countries. The aim of this study is assessing the health impacts of transport scenarios in Port Louis (city of 119,018 inhabitants in Mauritius) using a full chain participatory HIA model. METHODS: We estimated health and economic impacts associated to transport scenarios with qualitative data and quantitative comparative risk assessment methods. The health impact modeling was based on differences between the baseline and three transport scenarios (worse, good, ideal), estimating the averted deaths per year and economic outcomes by assessing health determinants of air pollution (AP), traffic deaths and physical activity (PA). Data on air pollution and traffic fatalities were obtained from public data sources. Data used to construct scenarios, establish baseline travel mode shares and physical activity were collected through (a) open-ended individual interviews (IDIs) with 14 stakeholders (b) closed-ended survey questions to 600 citizens and (c) 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with the same 14 stakeholders from (a). RESULTS: In Port Louis, the worse-case transport scenario (doubling in car trips and a reduction in walking, motorcycle, and public transport), resulted in a total increment of 3.28 premature deaths per year. The good-case scenario (reducing car trips by half and increasing walking, motorcycle, and public transport trips) resulted in a total increment of 0.79 premature deaths per year. The ideal-case scenario (reduction in car and motorcycle trips and an increase in walking and public transport trips) resulted in a total reduction of 13.72 premature deaths per year. We estimated USD 23 millions of economic benefits related to mortality if the ideal-case was achieved. CONCLUSION: Participatory HIA shows that implementing transport policies aiming for less than an ideal situation may not be adequate or sufficient to avoid negative transport-related mortality in Mauritius. Urban transport planning is an opportunity to encourage physical activity in rapidly urbanizing settings of Africa. Transport policies should aim to restrict all forms of private motorized vehicles and promote active and public transport to support public health. We highly recommend the use of participatory approaches in quantitative HIA to ensure context specificity and policy relevance.","output":"Participatory quantitative health impact assessment of urban transport planning: A case study from Eastern Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the first time, we present, i) an account of decay in the genetic material loading of SARS-CoV-2 during Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) treatment of wastewater, and ii) comparative evaluation of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and filtration as virus concentration methods from wastewater for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genes The objectives were achieved through tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic loadings i e ORF1ab, N and S protein genes on 8th and 27th May 2020 along the wastewater treatment plant (106 million liters per day) equipped with UASB system in Ahmedabad, India PEG method performed better in removing materials inhibiting RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 gene detection from the samples, as evident from constant and lower CT values of control (MS2) Using the PEG method, we found a reduction &gt;1 3 log10 in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance during UASB treatment, and the RNA was not detected at all in the final effluent The study implies that i) conventional wastewater treatment systems is effective in SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal, and ii) UASB system significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 genetic loadings Finally, PEG method is recommended for better sensitivity and inhibition removal during SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in wastewater","output":"Decay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA along the wastewater treatment outfitted with Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) system evaluated through two sample concentration techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients are at a higher risk of stroke.

The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between three modifiable work environment factors (autonomy, control-over-practice, and workload) and Canadian public health nurses' (PHNs) job satisfaction. METHODS Data were from the 2005 National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses (response rate, 79.7%; 18,676 nurses). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used for this secondary analysis. Findings were discussed with practicing PHNs, policy-makers and researchers from across Canada at a knowledge translation (KT) 'Think-Tank'. RESULTS Among the 271 PHNs, 53.5% reported being 'very satisfied' with their jobs.

One has postulated three aspects of trustworthiness as state-based antecedents to trust. Another has been interpreted to comprise two aspects of trustworthiness. Empirical data shows support for both models, and debate remains as to the theoretical and practical reasons researchers may adopt one model over the other. The present research aimed to consider this debate by investigating the factor structure of trustworthiness. Taking items from two scales commonly employed to assess trustworthiness, we leveraged structural equation modeling to explore which theoretical model is supported by the data in an organizational trust context. We considered an array of first-order, second-order, and bifactor models. The best-fitting model was a bifactor model comprising one general trustworthiness factor and ability, benevolence, and integrity grouping factors. This model was determined to be essentially unidimensional, though this is qualified by the finding that the grouping variables accounted for significant variance with for several organizational outcome criteria. These results suggest that respondents typically employ a general factor when responding to items assessing trustworthiness, and researchers may be better served treating the construct as unidimensional or engaging in scale parceling of their models to reflect this response tendency more accurately. However, the substantial variance accounted by the grouping variables in hierarchical regression suggest there may be contexts in which it would be acceptable to consider the theoretical factors of ability, benevolence, and integrity independent of general trustworthiness.","output":"I Think You Are Trustworthy, Need I Say More?

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 130 women: T1DM (n = 40), T2DM (n = 35), gestational diabetes (GDM, n = 40) and the control group (n = 15). The serum concentrations of NT, 8-isoprostane, and TAC were measured by ELISA methods. RESULTS: Elevated 8-isoprostane levels were observed in all patients with DM, but this biomarker's maximum values have been seen in T1DM and T2DM on insulin groups. A similar tendency was observed for the concentration of NT in both the 1st and 3rd trimesters. TAC levels showed a statistically relevant decrease in all DM groups compared to the control. The correlation analysis showed a direct correlation between HbA1c and serum 8-isoprostane levels in the 1st (r = .27) and 3rd (r = .3) pregnancy trimesters as well as inverse correlation with TAC level (r = -.48).

Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection have various comorbidities. Their presence in the background of coronavirus has a tendency to worsen the course of the disease and increase the risk of unfavorable outcomes. Understanding the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the most common comorbidities is key to the successful management of these patients. Methods. We systematically searched Medline, Springer and Elsevier databases and accessed the full text on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the following conditions: cardiovascular, renal, immunosuppression, metabolic disorder and hematological in order to prepare a narrative review on this topic. Results. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases are more likely to suffer from severe forms of COVID-19. Cardiovascular diseases were also noted as the most frequent comorbidities among coronavirus patients. Metabolic syndrome and its components have been identified as the second most common comorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19. Infected patients with acute kidney injury also show a higher mortality rate among the others. Immunocompromised patients, such as organ recipients and cancer and hematologic patients, develop more severe forms of COVID-19 and are at higher risk of admission to ICUs and requiring mechanical ventilation. Higher mortality rates among those patients have also been observed. Conclusions. Based on recent studies, patients with co-existing diseases are at higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19 virus infection and unfavorable outcomes. Cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome and immunosuppressive and kidney diseases in the presence of coronavirus may lead to longer and more aggressive treatment in the ICU and increased mortality rate.","output":"Mini Review: Co-Existing Diseases and COVID-19A One Way Ticket?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The association between age at fist calving (AFC) and production, fertility and survivability in Jersey heifers requires evaluation and comparison with published literature on Holstein heifers.

RESULTS: Increased lifetime daily yield (LDY) was significantly associated with a reduced AFC; calving UK Jersey heifers at 24 months or below is optimal. Heifers calving at 25-26 months had a significantly lower mean calving interval (391 days; 95 per cent CI 386 to 397) than those calving over 30 months (399; 95 per cent CI 394 to 405) (P=0.03). Heifers with an AFC over 30 months were less likely to survive to second lactation than those with an AFC 18-24 months. Spring calving heifers produced significantly less milk per day (9.87 kg; 95 per cent CI 9.64 to 10.1) than autumn (10.18; 95 per cent CI 9.94 to 10.41) or winter calvers (10.07; 95 per cent CI 9.84 to 10.3) (P&#8804;0.01).

The academic workload on students can cause exhaustion, similar to that of a worker. The Maslach Burnout Inventory- Student Survey (MBI-SS) was designed to reflect student burnout by evaluation of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. It has been reported that at least half of the students will suffer burnout at some point in their medical studies. Burnout evaluation has been focused on physicians or those working in hospitals attending coronavirus patients. The psychological burden and pressures on students due to the closure of facilities and schools around the world has not been thoroughly evaluated. The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed. The MBI-SS was applied during the spring semester to all anatomy students of one of the largest medical schools in Mexico. The study was previously reviewed and approved by the Ethics and Research Committees to be answered anonymously and voluntarily. Results were classified as low, moderate, or high in emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic effectiveness. Results A total of 154 students participated in the survey, with a mean age of 18.9 years, 60.4% (n = 93) were women. Based on the MBI-SS definition, 14.9% (n = 23) were identified with symptoms of burnout. There was also a high prevalence of emotional exhaustion (53.9% n = 83), cynicism (16.9% n = 26), and low academic effectiveness (34.4% n = 53). Men were statistically more prevalent towards lower academic effectiveness (p = 0.037) and increased cynicism (p = 0.003), as well as a higher incidence of burnout (26.6% vs 7.5%, p = 0.001). Conclusions Burnout prevalence among medical students has been reported as high as 46% during the pandemic, however different types of surveys have been used. A previous study using the same survey reported a prevalence of 5.2% for moderate burnout syndrome, in a similar population which could indicate the COVID-19 pandemic as an influencing factor.

Urea is one treatment option, which is thought to improve the efficacy of topical and oral antifungal agents. Despite a theoretical basis for the use of urea for the treatment of onychomycosis, the evidence-base for this treatment has not been systematically reviewed. Aim The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to determine the efficacy and safety of urea as a monotherapy and as adjunct therapy, compared to other treatment regimens for onychomycosis. Method A systematic literature search of ten electronic databases was conducted. Only studies that used microscopy and culture or other validated laboratory-based testing method to confirm the presence of a fungal infection before treatment were included. The outcome measures assessed were efficacy (defined in terms of mycological, clinical and complete cure) and safety (defined as self-reported adverse events). Results The systematic search yielded 560 unique studies for review. Of these, only six were eligible for inclusion. All studies were observed to have methodological concerns, most studies consisted of small sample sizes and were difficult to compare given heterogeneity in outcome measures and follow-up time.

Although TEE has a good safety profile, it was recently reported that TEE preceding PVI can cause esophageal mucosal injuries (EMIs). The exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the incidence and risk factors of TEE-related EMI (TEE-EMI) among patients who underwent PVI for AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 262 consecutive patients who underwent PVI with preoperative TEE using a 3D TEE probe and postoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy. TEE-EMIs were observed in 16 (6.1%) patients (18 lesions), whereas PVI-related EMIs were found in 5 (1.9%) patients (8 lesions). All TEE-EMIs were observed in the upper or middle esophagus and occurred more frequently in the right region of the upper esophagus and the left anterior region of the middle esophagus; only one patient experienced mild chest discomfort. In the multivariate analysis, advanced age was an independent risk factor for TEE-EMIs (odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; Pa?=a?0.0274). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of TEE-EMIs with 3D TEE probes was relatively high in the upper or middle esophagus, anatomically close to the LA, among patients who underwent PVI. Advanced age could pose a significant risk. These findings may warrant consideration of other methods to rule out LA/LAA thrombi, especially in elderly patients.","output":"Prevalence and characteristics of transesophageal echocardiography-related esophageal mucosal injury in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent pulmonary vein isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide spread of COVID-19 first reported from Wuhan in China is attributed to migration and mobility of people In this article, we present how our understanding of migration and livelihood could be helpful in designing a mitigating strategy of economic and social impact of COVID-19 in India We conclude that there are many challenges migrants face during the spread of COVID-19 resulting from nationwide lockdown Many internal migrants faced problems such as lack of food, basic amenities, lack of health care, economic stress, lack of transportation facilities to return to their native places and lack of psychological support On the other hand, COVID-19 has also brought into sharp focus the emigrants from India and the major migration corridors India shares with the world as well There is a huge uncertainty about how long this crisis will last This article further provides some immediate measures and long term strategies to be adopted by the government such as improving public distribution system, strengthening public health system, integration of migrants with development, decentralisation as a strategy to provide health services, and providing support to return migrants to reintegrate them, and also strengthen the database on migration and migrant households ? 2020 MIGRATION LETTERS Transnational Press London","output":"The COVID-19, migration and livelihood in India: Challenges and policy issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a health-threatening condition, which is a violation of the heart rhythm that can lead to heart-related complications.

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation).

In this study we evaluated the relation of BCG vaccination, tuberculosis skin test (TST) result and COVID-19 in HCW. Materials and methods: The study was designed as retrospective, case control study in the health care personnel working in pandemics clinics. The whole cases were divided to two groups as COVID-19 group (with a history of SARS CoV-2 infection) and control group (who did not suffer from COVID-19). Demographic data, TST, BCG scar and history for SARS CoV-2 infection were collected from hospital staff working in pandemics clinics between March 15, 2020 and November 15, 2020. In the cases suffered from COVID-19 the clinical and laboratory features and radiological severity of pneumonia -if present- and time for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conversion in nasopharyngeal swab were recorded. All parameters were compared between two groups. Results: 148 HCW were included to the study. COVID-19 group included 68 (66.7%) females and 34 (33.3%) males (mean age: 369 years) and control group included 23 (50%) females and 23 (50%) males (mean age: 358 years). The mean value of TST for whole group was 6.37.6 mm and similar between groups. The number of cases with BCG scars were significantly more in COVID-19 group (p=0.04). In COVID-19 group 29 (28.4%) of the cases were hospitalized while only 1(1%) suffered from severe disease. None of the cases were died.

The aim of the study was to assess the SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and in a group of unexposed subjects. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was quantified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 87 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (range 7-239 days after symptom onset) and 33 unexposed donors by ex vivo ELISpot assay. Follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was performed in ten subjects up to 12 months after symptom onset. The role of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was characterized in a group of COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies were determined in serum samples. RESULTS: In 14/33 (42.4%) unexposed donors and 85/87 (97.7%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects a positive result for at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen was observed. A positive response was observed up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection (median 246 days after symptom onset; range 118-362 days). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response seems to be mainly mediated by CD4 T cells. A weak positive correlation was observed between Spike-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody titre (p 0.0028; r2 = 0.2891) and positive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was observed in 8/9 (88.9%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

In the present study, we focus on a specific tactic of reappraisal known as distancing. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion and the emotion regulation literature, we examine how distancing moderates the relationship between fear and risk taking and anger and risk taking. In three pre-registered studies (N(total) = 1,483), participants completed various risky judgment and decision-making tasks. Replicating previous results, Study 1 revealed a negative relationship between fear and risk taking and a positive relationship between anger and risk taking at low levels of distancing. Study 2 replicated the interaction between fear and distancing but found no interaction between anger and distancing. Interestingly, at high levels of distancing, we observed a reversal of the relationship between fear and risk taking in both Study 1 and 2. Study 3 manipulated emotion and distancing by asking participants to reflect on current fear-related and anger-related stressors from an immersed or distanced perspective. Study 3 found no main effect of emotion nor any evidence of a moderating role of distancing. However, exploratory analysis revealed a main effect of distancing on optimistic risk estimation, which was mediated by a reduction in self-reported fear. Overall, the findings suggest that distancing can help regulate the influence of incidental fear on risk taking and risk estimation.

Experimental studies have revealed a few evidences that coronavirus decayed quickly under the exposure of heat and humidity. This study aims to carry out an epidemiological investigation to establish the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 in high risk areas of the United States (U.S.). We analyzed daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven meteorological measures in top 50 U.S. counties with the most accumulative confirmed cases from March 22, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Our analyses indicate that each meteorological factor and COVID-19 more likely have a nonlinear association rather than a linear association over the wide ranges of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation observed. Average temperature, minimum relative humidity, and precipitation were better predictors to address the meteorological impact on COVID-19. By including all the three meteorological factors in the same model with their lagged effects up to 3 days, the overall impact of the average temperature on COVID-19 was found to peak at 68.45 F and decrease at higher degrees, though the overall relative risk percentage (RR %) reduction did not become significantly negative up to 85 F. There was a generally downward trend of RR % with the increase of minimum relative humidity; nonetheless, the trend reversed when the minimum relative humidity exceeded 91.42%. The overall RR % of COVID-19 climbed to the highest level of 232.07% (95% confidence interval = 199.77, 267.85) with 1.60 inches of precipitation, and then started to decrease.

For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from 3 $\\\\mu$m to 12 $\\\\mu$m. The LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared (NIR) by a factor of 100. A maximum emission power per area of 11x10^3 W/m$^2$ at $T=2000$ K for a bias voltage of $V=23$ V is achieved by Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory and considering the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in graphene in RPA, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 $\\\\mu$m and 150 $\\\\mu$m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between $12^\\\\circ$ and $80^\\\\circ$ by tuning the Fermi energy.

The main protease (MPro) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of MPro, we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae MPro in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of MPro structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 MPro. In agreement with this, we performed screening of a??7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 MPro as the primary target.

Although diagnostic real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests yield C(T) values that are inversely correlated with RNA quantity, these tests are only approved for qualitative interpretation. In this study, we performed a retrospective review of 72,217 SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and identified 264 patients with longitudinal positivity prior to vaccination and VOC circulation. Patients with longitudinal positivity fell into two categories: short-term (207, 78%) or prolonged (57, 22%) positivity, defined as 28 (range, 1 to 28; median, 16) days and >28 (range, 29 to 152; median, 41) days, respectively. In general, C(T) values increased over time in both groups; however, 11 short-term-positive patients had greater amounts of RNA detected at their terminal test than at the first positive test, and 6 patients had RNA detected at C(T) values of <35 at least 40 days after initial infection.

Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8 mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: Ten patients received the 4 mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8 mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at 2 h after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (P < .01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (P = .02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (P = .1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION: This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing.

The use of Cas12a allowed direct and specific recognition of transgenes. To enhance the sensitivity of the assay, we used rolling circle amplification (RCA) to monitor the recognition of transgenes by designing the RCA primer as the cleavage substrate of Cas12a. The presence of transgenes can be detected by monitoring the G-quadruplex in RCA amplicon using a G-quadruplex binding dye, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associations of work-related trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a cohort of resident physicians in their internship year of training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study involved physicians entering internship at US residency programs nationwide in 2018. Participants completed a baseline survey 1 to 2 months before commencing internship, as well as follow-up surveys at 4 time points during internship. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2020 to January 2021. EXPOSURES: Twelve months of internship. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of work-related trauma and prevalence of PTSD among those who experienced work-related trauma. Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Primary Care PTSD Screen for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (PC-PTSD-5). Risk factors assessed included depression, anxiety, early family environment, stressful life experiences, medical specialty, hours worked, and concern about medical errors. RESULTS: Among 1134 interns who completed the PC-PTSD-5 at month 12 of internship, 665 (58.6%) were female and 695 (61.6%) were non-Hispanic White; the mean (SD) age was 27.52 (2.50) years. There were 640 interns (56.4%) who reported work-related trauma exposure; among these interns with trauma exposure, 123 (19.0%) screened positive for PTSD. Overall, 123 of 1134 training physicians (10.8%) screened positive for PTSD by the end of internship year, as compared with a 12-month PTSD prevalence rate of 3.6% in the general population. Multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics, indicated that risk factors associated with trauma exposure included non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 1.51 [95% CI, 1.14-2.01]; P = .004), more hours worked (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.03]; P = .03), early family environment (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P < .001), and stressful life experiences at baseline (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.06-2.01]; P = .02). Risk factors associated with PTSD were being unmarried (OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.07-3.73]; P = .03) and non-Hispanic White (OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.01-3.11]; P = .05), concern about medical errors (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.00-1.46]; P = .05), stressful life experiences during internship (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.14-1.81]; P = .002), depression at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.52 [95% CI = 1.36-4.65], P = .003), and anxiety at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.14, [95% CI, 1.13-4.04]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that work-related PTSD was 3 times more prevalent among intern physicians than the general population.

Objective: To compare treatment with sacubitril/valsartan treatment with valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction and recent New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted; a total of 335 patients with advanced heart failure were included. The trial began on March 2, 2017, and was stopped early on March 23, 2020, owing to COVID-19 risk. Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan (target dose, 200 mg twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily) in addition to recommended therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The area under the curve (AUC) for the ratio of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared with baseline measured through 24 weeks of therapy. Results: Of the 335 patients included in the analysis, 245 were men (73%); mean (SD) age was 59.4 (13.5) years. Seventy-two eligible patients (18%) were not able to tolerate sacubitril/valsartan, 100 mg/d, during the short run-in period, and 49 patients (29%) discontinued sacubitril/valsartan during the 24 weeks of the trial. The median NT-proBNP AUC for the valsartan treatment arm (n = 168) was 1.19 (IQR, 0.91-1.64), whereas the AUC for the sacubitril/valsartan treatment arm (n = 167) was 1.08 (IQR, 0.75-1.60). The estimated ratio of change in the NT-proBNP AUC was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84-1.08; P = .45). Compared with valsartan, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan did not improve the clinical composite of number of days alive, out of hospital, and free from heart failure events. Aside from a statistically significant increase in non-life-threatening hyperkalemia in the sacubitril/valsartan arm (28 [17%] vs 15 [9%]; P = .04), there were no observed safety concerns. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this trial showed that, in patients with chronic advanced heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, there was no statistically significant difference between sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan with respect to reducing NT-proBNP levels.

We conducted this study intending to whether the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test using a saliva sample is effective and valid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of both the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a saliva sample from individuals suspected as having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 305 samples were collected and tested in Aichi Medical University Hospital and affiliated facilities from December 2020 until January 2021 at our institute. Using reverse-transcription PCR as a reference, the AUROC of the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test was 0.903 (95% confidential interval 0.845-0.962, p < 0.001). The appropriate cut-off antigen level was 4.0 pg/mL and had a sensitivity of 77.8%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 98%, and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of the antigen test decreased among patients among patients with COVID-19 with threshold cycle (Ct-value)&#8805;27, which shows the AUROC was 0.795 (95%CI 0.687-0.907, p < 0.001).

Here, we develop a mathematical model that quantifies the probability of post-quarantine transmission incorporating testing into travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time of infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. We find that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortens quarantine by at most one day. In a real-world test of our theory applied to offshore oil rig employees, 47 positives were obtained with testing on entry and exit to quarantine, of which 16 had tested negative at entry; preventing an expected nine offshore transmission events that each could have led to outbreaks.

Recombination produces RNA populations distinct from full-length gene segments and can influence viral population dynamics, persistence, and host immune responses. Viruses in the Reoviridae family, including rotavirus and mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), have been reported to package segments containing rearrangements or internal deletions. Rotaviruses with RNA segments containing rearrangements have been isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent children and in vitro following serial passage at high multiplicity. Reoviruses that package small, defective RNA segments have established chronic infections in cells and in mice. However, the mechanism and extent of Reoviridae RNA recombination are undefined. Towards filling this gap in knowledge, we determined the titers and RNA segment profiles for reovirus and rotavirus following serial passage in cultured cells. The viruses exhibited occasional titer reductions characteristic of interference. Reovirus strains frequently accumulated segments that retained 5 and 3 terminal sequences and featured large internal deletions, while similar segments were rarely detected in rotavirus populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing to analyze RNA molecules packaged in purified reovirus particles, we identified distinct recombination sites within individual viral gene segments. Recombination junction sites were frequently associated with short regions of identical sequence. Taken together, these findings suggest that reovirus accumulates defective gene segments featuring internal deletions during passage and undergoes sequence-directed recombination at distinct sites. IMPORTANCE Viruses in the Reoviridae family include important pathogens of humans and other animals and have segmented RNA genomes. Recombination in RNA virus populations can facilitate novel host exploration and increased disease severity. The extent, patterns, and mechanisms of Reoviridae recombination and the functions and effects of recombined RNA products are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that mammalian orthoreovirus regularly synthesizes RNA recombination products that retain terminal sequences but contain internal deletions, while rotavirus rarely synthesizes such products. Recombination occurs more frequently at specific sites in the mammalian orthoreovirus genome, and short regions of identical sequence are often detected at junction sites. These findings suggest that mammalian orthoreovirus recombination events are directed in part by RNA sequences. An improved understanding of recombined viral RNA synthesis may enhance our capacity to engineer improved vaccines and virotherapies in the future.","output":"Reovirus RNA recombination is sequence directed and generates internally deleted defective genome segments during passage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an important nutrient source in the diet of residents, vegetables are an important guarantee to enhance immunity The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to labor restrictions, poor logistics and transportation, and changes in residents' consumption and eating patterns, which have challenged the traditional supply model of vegetables In response to this challenge, this study analyzes the outbreak of vegetables reserves, distribution, supply, quality and safety and the influence of supply mode in five aspects It also analyzes how to carry out technical research in order to make timely adjustments to the supply mode of vegetable products and ensure the residents' vegetable supply ?

We aimed to describe the characteristics of spontaneous symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Database for data from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected prior to or within 7 days after symptomatic ICH. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data, then combined data from this pooled analysis with aggregate-level data. RESULTS: We included data from 139 patients (98 with individual data and 41 with aggregate-level data). In our pooled individual data analysis, the median age (IQR) was 60 (53-67) years and 64% (95% CI 54-73.7%) were male; 79% (95% CI 70.0-86.9%) had critically severe COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of lobar ICH was 67% (95% CI 56.3-76.0%), and of multifocal ICH was 36% (95% CI 26.4-47.0%). 71% (95% CI 61.0-80.4%) of patients were treated with anticoagulation (58% (95% CI 48-67.8%) therapeutic). The median NIHSS was 28 (IQR 15-28); mortality was 54% (95% CI 43.7-64.2%). Our combined analysis of individual and aggregate data showed similar findings. The pooled incidence of ICH across 12 cohort studies of inpatients with COVID-19 (n = 63,390) was 0.38% (95% CI 0.22-0.58%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ICH associated with COVID-19 has different characteristics compared to ICH not associated with COVID-19, including frequent lobar location and multifocality, a high rate of anticoagulation, and high mortality.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 years and there were more males than females in the cohort (56.4% vs 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test pre-operatively and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Post-operatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 days. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA Class 3 or 4.

Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the post-operative period.","output":"Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery: A New York City experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world pandemic since early 2020.Currently, there is no established treatment to combat this potentially fatal disease. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has a strong scientific basis and historical perspective to treat previous viral infections such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma CP therapy in patients with COVID-19.We searched for every available study from major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE) through 20th April 2020. We independently screened, extracted, assessed the risk of bias, analyzed the data using SPSS version 26, and narratively summarized the data. For the outcomes, we wanted to evaluate the changes of clinical parameters, radiological appearance, pulmonary function, the titer of neutralizing antibody, viral load, the disappearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and adverse events.We found five case series from our literature searching. The overall methodological quality of the case series was moderate. We included 27 patients, and all patients received CP transfusion. All patients experienced improvement of clinical symptoms and pulmonary lesions after receiving 200 to 2400 mL (median 200 mL) of CP transfusion. All patients in reported studies had negative results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) after 1 to 26 days of transfusion (median 3 days). There was one non-life threatening adverse event reported after CP transfusion (facial red spot). In conclusion, CP therapy in COVID-19 patients showed promising results as it improved clinical symptoms and parameters, and it is well-tolerated based on our included studies. However, further expanded clinical trials with better designs are still required to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment although suchidea will be quite challenging to be conducted in the era of an epidemic.","output":"Efficacy And Safety Of Convalescent Plasma Therapy In Patients With COVID-19: Arapid Review Of Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting with an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak.

To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately.

The present study should analyze the impact of the local COVID-19 epidemic on emergency resources for all hospitals in a major urban center (Moenchengladbach, Germany). Methods: : An observational multicenter study was performed involving all four acute care hospitals. Systemic parameters department (ED) parameters from week 4 to 24 in 2020 were compared to the corresponding period in 2019 for each hospital and in a summative data analysis using a logistic regression model. Outcomes: ED visits, ED to hospital admission, ED to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, medical specialties of admitted patients, work related accidents. Results: : In week 9/2020 the first SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were detected in our region. All hospitals decided to minimize elective admissions to ensure operational capability for COVID-19 patients. The summative number of ED visits dropped from 34,659 to 28,008. Numbers decreased from week 8 on between 38% and 48% per week per hospital at the maximum and began to rise again from week 16 on. The pooled data analysis showed statistically significant decreases in outpatient ED visits (20,152 vs. 16,477, p=<0.001), hospital admissions of ED patients (14,507 vs. 11,531, p=<0.001), and work-related accidents (2,290 vs. 1,468, p=<0.001). The decrease in admissions from ED to ICU did not reach statistical significance (2,093 vs. 1,566, p=0.255). The decline in ED cases was mainly caused by a decrease in non-trauma and non-surgical patients. Conclusion: The regional COVID-19 outbreak led to significantly reduced ED contacts after the first COVID-19 cases appeared. Even the admissions to the hospitals and the number of ED to ICU-admissions decreased, which is potentially dangerous, because the ratio of emergency outpatients vs. inpatients remained stable. Therefore, one can assume that patients with severe medical problems did not seek ED care in many cases. The decline of patients was earlier than in other German hospitals and in contrast to the findings in the U.S. and Italy where ED visits and hospital admissions in medical disciplines increased.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Emergency Resources C An Observational Multicenter Study Including All Hospitals in a Major Urban Center of the Rhein Ruhr Metropolitan Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Hospitals were mandated to dramatically increase capacity during the Covid-19 crisis in New York City. Conversion of non-clinical space into medical units designated for Covid-19 patients became necessary to accommodate this mandate. METHODS: Non-clinical space was converted into medical units at multiple campuses of a large academic hospital system over 1 week. The conversion required construction to deliver basic care including oxygen supplementation. Creation of provider workspaces, handwashing areas, and colour-coded infection control zones was prioritized. Selection criteria were created with a workflow to determine appropriate patients for transfer into converted space. Staffing of converted space shifted as hospitalizations surged. RESULTS: The unit was open for 18 days and accommodated 170 unique patients. Five patients (2.9%) required transfer to a higher level of care. There were no respiratory arrests, cardiac arrests, or deaths in the new unit. CONCLUSION: Converting non-clinical space to a medical unit was accomplished quickly with staffing, workflow for appropriate patients, few patients who returned to a higher level of care, and no respiratory or cardiac arrests or deaths on the unit.","output":"Creation of a medical ward from non-clinical space amidst the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I apply concepts and tools from evolutionary medicine to understanding the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. The pandemic represents a mismatched conflict, with dynamics and pathology apparently driven by three main factors: (1) bat immune systems that rely on low inflammation but high efficacy of interferon-based defences; (2) viral tactics that differentially target the human interferon system, leading to substantial asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission; and (3) high mortality caused by hyper-inflammatory and hyper-coagulatory phenotypes, that represent dysregulated tradeoffs whereby collateral immune-induced damage becomes systemic and severe. This framework can explain the association of mortality with age (which involves immune life-history shifts towards higher inflammation and coagulation, and reduced adaptive immunity), and sex (since males senesce faster than females). Genetic-risk factors for Covid-19 mortality can be shown, from a phenome-wide association analysis of the relevant SNPs, to be associated with inflammation and coagulation; the PheWAS also provides evidence, consistent with several previous studies, that the calcium channel blocking drug amlodipine mediates risk of mortality.","output":"Evolutionary medical insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The map presented in this brief note summarizes regional differences in population age structures between the NUTS-3 regions of Europe in the context of unequal age- and sex-specific death risks associated with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic Since older people are exposed to much higher death risks, older populations are expected to face much more difficult challenges coping with the pandemic The urban/rural dimension turns out to be very important as the remote rural areas are also the oldest In the map NUTS-3 regions of Europe are colored according to the deviation from European pooled estimate of the proportion of population at risk of death due to COVID-19 We assume that 5/6 of the populations get infected and experience age-specific infection-fatality ratios (IFRs) modelled by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team We adjust IFRs by sex ratios of age-specific case-fatality ratios observed in the European countries that are included in the COVerAGE-DB Thus, we effectively introduce a summary measure of population age structures focused on the most vulnerable to the pandemic Such an estimate for the total European population is 1% The map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID-19 fatality It is a case-if scenario that highlights the possible effect of the population age structures, a demographic perspective This analysis clearly shows the contribution of regional differences in population age structures to the magnitude of the pandemic -- other things equal, we expect to see a four-fold variation in average regional infection-fatality ratios across Europe due only to differences in the population structures","output":"COVID-19 in unequally ageing European regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two clusters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were confirmed in Hokkaido, Japan, in February 2020.

That these molecules remain concentrated, it is assumed that both cell populations stand in close contact to each other. However, recently published data illustrate that epithelial and mesenchymal cells are separated by an astonishingly wide interstitial interface. METHODS To gain deeper morphological insights into the spatial distribution of mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells, the embryonic zone of neonatal rabbit kidney was fixed either with glutaraldehyde (GA) or in a combination with cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid. Transmission electron microscopy was then performed on exactly orientated sections. RESULTS Conventional fixation with GA illustrates that epithelial and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells are separated by a bright but inconspicuously looking interstitial interface. In contrast, fixation of specimens in GA containing cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid elucidates that part of the interstitial interface exhibits a special extracellular matrix extending like woven strands between mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells. In parallel, filigree projections from mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells cross the interstitial interface to penetrate the basal lamina of epithelial cells. Fusion of the plasma membranes cannot be observed. Instead, touching mesenchymal cell projections form a cone at the contact site with tunneling nanotubes. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that the contact between mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells does not form accidentally but physiologically and appears to belong to a suspected system involved in the exchange of morphogenetic information.","output":"Cell projections and extracellular matrix cross the interstitial interface within the renal stem/progenitor cell niche: accidental, structural or functional cues?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The worldwide prevalence of overweight/obesity has continued to rise over the last decades. To reverse this trend, public health authorities are exploring cost-effective interventions, especially in high-income and middle-income countries. Community gardening offers a unique opportunity for individuals to enhance physical activity levels and improve their diet. However, synthesised evidence on the short-term or long-term effectiveness and on the costs of community gardening interventions to prevent overweight/obesity remains limited. Therefore, this review will investigate: (1) the effectiveness of voluntary participation in community gardening compared with no or a control intervention on overweight/obesity and associated health outcomes, (2) effects on different subgroups of populations and (3) the costs of community gardening interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review, limited to evaluations of community gardening interventions with controlled quantitative and interrupted time series designs. To identify relevant articles, we will systematically search 12 academic and 5 grey literature databases, as well as 2 trial registers and 6 websites. Articles will then be assessed for eligibility based on a predefined set of criteria. At least two independent reviewers will assess each article for relevance, before evaluating the methodological quality and potential bias of the studies. Data relevant to the objectives of this review will be extracted and cross-validated. Any disagreements will be mediated by a third reviewer. If feasible, meta-analyses of primary outcomes (overweight/obesity, physical activity, food intake, energy intake) will be conducted. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method to assess the overall quality of evidence.

Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1a??355a??349 antihypertensive users (363a??785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248a??915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711a??799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473a??076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 098, 95% CI 084-114) or combination use exposure (101, 090-115). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 091, 95% CI 068-121; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (095, 083-107). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 088, 95% CI 079-099) and non-significant for monotherapy (085, 069-105). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)-guided HF management using the CardioMEMS? HF system was shown to be safe and reduce HF hospitalisation (HFH) rates in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III patients. However, these findings have not been replicated in health systems outside the United States. Therefore, the CardioMEMS European Monitoring Study for Heart Failure (MEMS-HF) evaluated the safety, feasibility, and performance of this device in Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland. METHODS AND RESULTS 234 NYHA class III patients (6811 years, 22% female, 1 HFH in the preceding year) from 31 centres were implanted with a CardioMEMS sensor and underwent PAP-guided HF management. One-year rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of freedom from device-/system-related complications and from sensor failure (co-primary outcomes) were 98.3% (95.8-100.0) and 99.6% (97.6-100.0), respectively. Survival rate was 86.2%. For the 12 months post- versus pre-implant, HFHs decreased by 62% (0.60 vs. 1.55 events/patient-year; hazard ratio 0.38 [95% CI 0.31-0.48], P<0.0001). After 12 months, mean PAP decreased by 5.17.4 mmHg, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Overall/Clinical Summary Scores increased from 47.024.0/51.224.8 to 60.524.3/62.424.1 (P<0.0001), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire sum-score improved from 8.75.9 to 6.35.1 (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION Haemodynamic-guided HF management proved feasible and safe in the health systems of Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland. Physician-directed treatment modifications based on remotely obtained PAP values were associated with fewer HFH, sustainable PAP decreases, marked KCCQ improvements, and remission of depressive symptoms.

We sought to determine if patients with implantable defibrillators residing in areas with high COVID-19 activity experienced an increase in defibrillator shocks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Results Using the Medtronic (Mounds View, MN) Carelink database from 2019 and 2020, we retrospectively determined the incidence of implantable defibrillator shock episodes among patients residing in New York City, New Orleans, LA, and Boston, MA. A total of 14 665 patients with a Medtronic implantable defibrillator (age, 6613 years; and 72% men) were included in the analysis. Comparing analysis time periods coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 with the same periods in 2019, we observed a larger mean rate of defibrillator shock episodes per 1000 patients in New York City (17.8 versus 11.7, respectively), New Orleans (26.4 versus 13.5, respectively), and Boston (30.9 versus 20.6, respectively) during the COVID-19 surge. Age- and sex-adjusted hurdle model showed that the Poisson distribution rate of defibrillator shocks for patients with &#8805;1 shock was 3.11 times larger (95% CI, 1.08-8.99; P=0.036) in New York City, 3.74 times larger (95% CI, 0.88-15.89; P=0.074) in New Orleans, and 1.97 times larger (95% CI, 0.69-5.61; P=0.202) in Boston in 2020 versus 2019. However, the binomial odds of any given patient having a shock episode was not different in 2020 versus 2019. Conclusions Defibrillator shock episodes increased during the higher COVID-19 activity in New York City, New Orleans, and Boston. These observations may provide insights into COVID-19-related increase in cardiac arrests.","output":"Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Shocks During COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causal agent for most cervical cancers. The physical status of the HPV genome in these cancers could be episomal, integrated, or both. HPV integration could serve as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Although whole-genome sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as the Illumina sequencing platform, have been used for detecting integrated HPV genome in cervical cancer, it faces challenges of analyzing long repeats and translocated sequences. In contrast, Oxford nanopore sequencing technology can generate ultra-long reads, which could be a very useful tool for determining HPV genome sequence and its physical status in cervical cancer. As a proof of concept, in this study, we completed whole genome sequencing from a cervical cancer tissue and a CaSki cell line with Oxford Nanopore Technologies. From the cervical cancer tissue, a 7,894 bp-long HPV35 genomic sequence was assembled from 678 reads at 97-fold coverage of HPV genome, sharing 99.96% identity with the HPV sequence obtained by Sanger sequencing. A 7904 bp-long HPV16 genomic sequence was assembled from data generated from the CaSki cell line at 3857-fold coverage, sharing 99.99% identity with the reference genome (NCBI: U89348). Intriguingly, long reads generated by nanopore sequencing directly revealed chimeric cellularCviral sequences and concatemeric genomic sequences, leading to the discovery of 448 unique integration breakpoints in the CaSki cell line and 60 breakpoints in the cervical cancer sample.

We compared survival outcomes (survival to discharge and return of spontaneous circulation for 20 minutes [ROSC]) between patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection and non-COVID-19 patients using multivariable hierarchical regression, with hospital site as a random effect and patient and cardiac arrest variables with a significant (p<0.05) bivariate association as fixed effects. RESULTS: Overall, 1328 pediatric in-hospital CPR events were identified (590 IHCA, 738 bradycardia with poor perfusion), of which 46 (32 IHCA, 14 bradycardia) had suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection. Rates of survival to discharge were similar between those with and without COVID-19 infection (39.1% vs. 44.9%; adjusted RR, 1.14 [95% CI: 0.55-2.36]), and these estimates were similar for those with IHCA and bradycardia with poor perfusion (adjusted RRs of 1.03 and 1.05; interaction p=0.96).

Thus, the objective of this study was to formulate sustained-release microparticles (MPs) using a pH-independent release polymer and to evaluate their potential to improve the oral bioavailability of BBR. BBR loaded MPs were prepared using the emulsion crosslinking method and evaluated for particle size, circularity, morphology, entrapment efficiency, solid-state analysis, swelling index, and in vitro BBR release study fitted with different models of release kinetics. The MPs exhibited desired particle sizes ranges between 11.09C11.62 m and were almost spherical in shape, as confirmed by the circularity value and micrographic images. A loss of BBR crystallinity was observed after encapsulation in MPs, as evident from various solid-state analyses. The final optimized batch (F3) showed highest % BBR entrapment efficiency value of 81.63%  4.9. The in vitro BBR release performance in both acidic and alkaline media showed the desired sustained release behavior from the crosslinked MPs, where the maximum BBR release was observed at alkaline pH, which is in accordance with the swelling study data. In the in vivo study, the oral absorption profiles of BBR from both pristine and MPs formats were investigated using in-house prototyped 3D printed hollow capsules as a unit dose carrier. In vivo data showed sustained and prolonged absorption behavior of BBR from MPs compared to their pristine counterparts, which resulted in a cumulative increment of relative oral bioavailability to mitigate the aforementioned issues related to BBR.

The differences in the types of adverse events, including severity, onset time, and duration of symptoms, and how the adverse events were dealt with by the patient were analyzed based on the age and sex. The profiles of adverse events were compared after the first and second vaccination doses. RESULTS: Among the 131 participants who participated in the online survey out of 208 vaccine recipients, 43 and 80 recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine experienced adverse events after the first and second dose, respectively. No sex-related differences were observed in the profiles of adverse events in vaccinated recipients. The overall frequency of adverse events did not differ based on age after the first dose. After the second dose, the frequency of adverse events, including both local and systemic reactions was significantly higher in the younger age group than in the older age group.

A dysregulated stress system is a consistent finding, however, and exhaustion is a consistent trait in adolescent patients. The aim of this paper is to critically assess current hypotheses in adolescent depression research and reframe causes and treatment approaches. METHODS: A mixed-method approach involved a review based on publications from PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo, and two exemplary adolescent cases. RESULTS: Both cases show a spiral of stress and exhaustion, but with a different profile of symptoms and coping mechanisms. Reframing both cases from the perspective of coping behavior, searching for the sources of experienced stress and exhaustion, showed coping similarities. This proved essential in the successful personalized treatment and recovery process. In combination with recent evidence, both cases support the functional reframing of depression as the outcome of a stress- and exhaustion-related spiralling mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: We propose to open up a symptom-based, mood-centered view to a model in which adolescent depression is framed as a consecutive failure of stress coping mechanisms and chronic exhaustion. Addressing exhaustion and coping primarily as a treatment strategy in adolescents and young adults might work in synergy with existing treatments and improve overall outcomes.

While several complications, such as tissue necrosis after embolization, have been reported, little is known regarding subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI) due to contrast media. To elucidate whether emergency angiography would introduce kidney dysfunction in trauma victims, we compared the incidence of AKI between patients who underwent emergency angiography and those who did not. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a nationwide trauma database (2004C2019), and adult trauma patients were included. The indication of emergency angiography was determined by both trauma surgeons and radiologists, and AKI was diagnosed by treating physicians based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output according to any published standard criteria. Incidence of AKI was compared between patients who underwent emergency angiography and those who did not. Propensity score matching was conducted to adjust baseline characteristics including age, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, vital signs on admission, Injury Severity Scale (ISS), degree of traumatic kidney injury, surgical procedures, and surgery on the kidney, such as nephrectomy and nephrorrhaphy. RESULTS: Among 230,776 patients eligible for the study, 14,180 underwent emergency angiography. The abdomen/pelvis was major site for angiography (10,624 [83.5%]). Embolization was performed in 5,541 (43.5%). Propensity score matching selected 12,724 pairs of severely injured patients (median age, 59; median ISS, 25). While the incidence of AKI was rare, it was higher among patients who underwent emergency angiography than in those who did not (140 [1.1%] vs. 67 [0.5%]; odds ratio = 2.10 [1.57C2.82]; p < 0.01). The association between emergency angiography and subsequent AKI was observed regardless of vasopressor usage or injury severity in subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency angiography in trauma patients was probably associated with increased incidence of AKI. The results should be validated in future studies.

However, they require large amounts of training data which is not available for most domains. As shown in previous work (Thakur et al., 2021b), the performance of dense retrievers severely degrades under a domain shift. This limits the usage of dense retrieval approaches to only a few domains with large training datasets. In this paper, we propose the novel unsupervised domain adaptation method Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL), which combines a query generator with pseudo labeling from a cross-encoder. On six representative domain-specialized datasets, we find the proposed GPL can outperform an out-of-the-box state-of-the-art dense retrieval approach by up to 9.3 points nDCG@10. GPL requires less (unlabeled) data from the target domain and is more robust in its training than previous methods. We further investigate the role of six recent pre-training methods in the scenario of domain adaptation for retrieval tasks, where only three could yield improved results. The best approach, TSDAE (Wang et al., 2021) can be combined with GPL, yielding another average improvement of 1.4 points nDCG@10 across the six tasks.

The pandemic led to a shift in consumer demand for more residential space, both in the homes interior and exterior. With remote work severing the need to be located near the place of employment, some households opted for more space in lower-density areas, moving out of high-rise structures in the urban core to suburban and exurban single-family and low-rise homes, altering the price and rent-growth patterns among single-family detached, attached, and multifamily properties. While measures of rent change are available for multifamily residential properties, none exist for the single-family rental market, which makes up one-half of the residential rental market. The CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index (SFRI) fills the gap in rent measurement. The SFRI is a repeat-transaction rent index for single-family homes and is available monthly for the U.S., by major metros, by rent price tier and by property type. The SFRI reveals that after 12 months of the pandemic annual rent growth for detached properties was more than 5 percentage points higher than for attached properties. Substituting the SFRI for Owners Equivalent Rent, we find that Core CPI inflation would be nearly 2 percentage points higher by mid-2021. To the extent the rapid acceleration in single-family detached rent growth has yet to be reflected in the CPI, inflation measurement will be understated with delayed signals for economic policy makers.","output":"Housing preferences during the pandemic: effect on home price, rent, and inflation measurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Special Issue aims to explore the concepts of stress, coping resources, and coping strategies, which are rooted in several theories, such as the stress and coping theory and the salutogenesis theory, and to understand how their core constructs are manifested in various ethnic and cultural groups around the world.

Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a novel concept, in which a dynamic perfusion cartogram, generated by computer analysis, is superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in a small bowel resection-anastomosis model. METHODS A small bowel ischaemic segment was created laparoscopically in 13 pigs. Animals were allocated to having anastomoses performed at either low perfusion (25 per cent; n = 7) or high perfusion (75 per cent; n = 6), as determined by FLER analysis. Capillary lactate levels were measured in blood samples obtained by serosal puncturing in the ischaemic area, resection lines and vascularized areas. Pathological inflammation scoring of the anastomosis was carried out. RESULTS Lactate levels in the ischaemic area (mean(s.d.) 56(28) mmol/l) were higher than those in resection lines at 25 per cent perfusion (37(17) mmol/l; P = 0010) and 75 per cent perfusion (29(13) mmol/l; P < 0001), and higher than levels in vascular zones (25(10) mmol/l; P < 0001). Lactate levels in resection lines with 75 per cent perfusion were lower than those in lines with 25 per cent perfusion (P < 0001), and similar to those in vascular zones (P = 0188). Levels at resection lines with 25 per cent perfusion were higher than those in vascular zones (P = 0001). Mean(s.d.) global inflammation scores were higher in the 25 per cent perfusion group compared with the 75 per cent perfusion group for mucosa/submucosa (21(04) versus 12(04); P = 0003) and serosa (18(04) versus 08(08); P = 0014). A ratio of preanastomotic lactate levels in the ischaemic area relative to the resection lines of 2 or less was predictive of a more severe inflammation score. CONCLUSION In an experimental model, FLER appeared accurate in discriminating bowel perfusion levels. Surgical relevance Clinical assessment has limited accuracy in evaluating bowel perfusion before anastomosis. Fluorescence videography estimates intestinal perfusion based on the fluorescence intensity of injected fluorophores, which is proportional to bowel vascularization. However, evaluation of fluorescence intensity remains a static and subjective measure. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a dynamic fluorescence videography technique integrating near-infrared endoscopy and specific software. The software generates a virtual perfusion cartogram based on time to peak fluorescence, which can be superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. This experimental study demonstrates the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in bowel perfusion in a survival model of laparoscopic small bowel resection-anastomosis, based on biochemical and histopathological data. It is concluded that real-time imaging of bowel perfusion is easy to use and accurate, and should be translated into clinical use.","output":"Intraoperative fluorescence-based enhanced reality laparoscopic real-time imaging to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site in an experimental model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed grave structural faults in our global institutional architecture.

Although social buffering is beneficial for the recipient, it can also have anxiogenic effects on the provider of the social buffering C a phenomena referred to as stress contagion. Social buffering and stress contagion usually occur together, but they have traditionally been studied independently, thus limiting our understanding of this dyadic social interaction. In the present study, we examined the effects of preventative social buffering and stress contagion in socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We tested the hypothesis that this dynamic social interaction is associated with coordinated alterations in behaviors, neurochemical activation, and neuroimmune responses. To do so, adult male prairie voles were stressed via an acute immobilization restraint tube (IMO) either alone (Alone) or with their previously pair-bonded female partner (Partner) in the cage for 1 h. In contrast, females were placed in a cage containing either an empty IMO tube (Empty) or one that contained their pair-bonded male (Partner). Anxiety-like behavior was tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) following the 60-mins test and brain sections were processed for neurochemical/neuroimmune marker labeling for all subjects. Our data indicate that females in the Partner group were in contact with and sniffed the IMO tube more, showed fewer anxiety-like behaviors, and had a higher level of oxytocin expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) compared to the Empty group females. Males in the Partner group had lower levels of anxiety-like behavior during the EPM test, greater activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone expressing neurons in the PVN, lower activation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe, and lower levels of microgliosis in the nucleus accumbens.

Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 96.45% and PPV of 95.07%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation.

Recent reviews emphasized the role of membrane lipids in the infectivity mechanism of SARS-COV-2. Cholesterol-rich parts of cell membranes serve as docking places of host cells for the viruses. Coronavirus 2 is a member of a virus family with lipid envelope that fuses with host cell through endocytosis, internalizing its components in the cell. In vitro cell models have shown that depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin, and particularly methyl beta cyclodextrin disturb the host cell membrane lipid composition this way reducing the attachment of the virus to the protein receptors. This review aims to summarize the state of the art of research concerning the use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against this new virus and update work already published.","output":"The Use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against the 2019 novel coronavirus.

The NeuroSAFE technique (intra-operative frozen section analysis of the neurovascular structure adjacent margin) may help improve functional outcomes by promoting safe nerve-sparing (NS) RARP without compromising on oncological outcomes. NeuroSAFE technique has reported favourably in retrospective, single-centre studies but has never been evaluated prospectively by a randomised study. The NeuroSAFE PROOF Feasibility Study has succeeded in demonstrating feasibility and has facilitated opening of the full-scale, definitively powered NeuroSAFE Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (NCT03317990). We report on the design and progress of the full NeuroSAFE PROOF RCT. METHODS: Potent men (IIEF-5>21) with localised prostate cancer at 4 regional uro-oncology centres in the UK (UCLH, Bristol, Sheffield and Glasgow) are eligible. Participants are randomised 1:1 to RARP with NS decision guided by standard of care (clinical information, DRE and pre-operative mpMRI surgical plan) vs. RARP with NS decision guided by standard of care information and the NeuroSAFE technique. The primary outcome is erectile function recovery assessed by IIEF-5 score >15 at 12-months. Important secondary outcomes include detailed peri-operative outcomes, histological outcomes, post-operative complications, biochemical recurrence rates, urinary continence (assessed by ICIQ), and health related quality of life (assessed by Rand-36 and EQ-5D-5L). Aiming to demonstrate a difference of 15% in erectile function recovery rates between the arms, a total of 404 men will need to be randomised and treated. Patients will continue to be followed for outcomes until 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: At the time of writing, 159 men have been recruited and treated with RARP as per random allocation at the 4 participating sites. The independent DMC has met thrice to ensure the oncological safety of the trial and will continue to review the data at intervals. Covid-19 has led to significant challenges, including suspension of recruitment and difficulties performing follow-up. The trial team have developed new methods of recruitment, consent and follow-up to ensure conduct of the study remains in line with the highest standards of trial conduct. CONCLUSIONS: The NeuroSAFE technique has been reported as a method to optimise outcomes for men undergoing RARP for over a decade, but, in the absence of level 1 evidence, equipoise remains. We hope that our full trial (the first RCT of the NeuroSAFE technique in the world) will provide the evidence to establish whether what has long been a promising technique truly improves outcomes for men undergoing RP.","output":"Neurosafe proof: A multi-centre, pragmatic, RCT for men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. update on a trial in progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some of the key questions of interest during the COVID-19 pandemic (and all outbreaks) include: where did the disease start, how is it spreading, who is at risk, and how to control the spread.

In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials.

It has several varied causes out of which neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and its spectrum disorder have received a distinct entity. Various radiological and clinical features help us to suspect an etiology which then further guides us into the treatment protocol and prognosis of the patients. Materials and Methods A retrospective study performed in a referral center in North East India in 15 months. Thirty-two patients of LETM were enrolled based on clinical and radiological available data. An attempt was made to classify the various etiologies and correlate with their radiological findings. Results The most common etiology noted was NMO seen in 7 patients (21.8%) followed by tuberculosis (TB) (18.7%) and post-infection myelitis (18.7%). Other etiology seen was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (6.24%), spinal cord infarct (3.12%), radiation myelitis (6.24%), Japanese encephalitis sequalae (3.12%), systemic lupus erythematosus (3.12%), and remained undiagnosed in six patients (18.7%). Radiologically, cervico-dorsal spine was most common location in NMO (71%) whereas dorsolumbar in TB (50%). The lesion was predominantly central in both NMO (100%) and TB (80%) as compared with the other causes of LETM. It was noted that more than 50% of the transverse area of the cord was involved in both NMO (71%) and TB (50%), but < 50% involvement were more common in the post-infectious and others causes of LETM. Conclusion LETM has a various differential diagnosis, infection need to be kept in mind while ruling out NMO.

Design: Population-wide register-based cohort study. Setting: Primary and lower secondary schools in Norway have been open during the academic year 2020/2021 with strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in place. All identified contacts including student and staff members were urged to get tested following a positive SARS-CoV-2 case in a school. Participants: All students and educational staff in Norwegian primary and lower secondary schools from August 2020 to June 2021. Main outcome measures: Overall secondary attack rate (SAR14) was operationalized as the number of secondary cases (among students and/or staff) in the school by 14 days after the index case, divided by the number of students and staff members in the school. Moreover, we calculated SAR14-to-students, denoting transmission from all index cases to students only, SAR14-to-school staff, denoting transmission from all index cases to staff members only. We also calculated these measures in stratified samples consisting of student index cases or school staff index cases. Results: From August 2020 to June 2021 there were 4,078 index cases, 79% were students and 21% were school staff. In the majority (55%) of schools with an index case, no secondary cases were observed by 14 days, and in 16% of the schools there were only one secondary case within 14 days. Overall SAR14 was found to be 0.33% (95%CI 0.32-0.33). Staff-to-staff transmission (SAR14 0.45%, 95%CI 0.40-0.52) was found to be slightly more common than student-to-student (SAR14 0.33%, 95%CI 0.32-0.34) and student-to-staff (SAR14 0.28%, 95%CI 0.25-0.30) transmission. Conclusions: Our results confirm that schools have not been an important arena of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway and therefore support that schools can be kept open with IPC measures in place.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Norwegian schools: A population-wide register-based cohort study on characteristics of the index case and secondary attack rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some isoquinoline alkaloids from Macleaya cordata (Willd).

METHODS: The targets of 26 isoquinoline alkaloids identified from M. cordata were predicted by a pharmacophore-based target fishing approach. Discovery Studio 3.5 and two pharmacophore databases (PharmaDB and HypoDB) were employed for the target profiling. A compoundCtarget interaction network of M. cordata was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape 3.0. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 65 predicted targets identified by PharmaDB were confirmed as targets by HypoDB screening. The targets in the interaction network of M. cordata were involved in cancer (31 targets), microorganisms (12 targets), neurodegeneration (10 targets), inflammation and autoimmunity (8 targets), parasitosis (5 targets), injury (4 targets), and pain (3 targets). Dihydrochelerythrine (C6) was found to hit 23 fitting targets. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) hits 15 alkaloids (C1C2, C11C16, C19C25) was the most promising target related to cancer.

More recently, mechanical methods for assessment of spinal stiffness have demonstrated superior accuracy and reliability. However, mechanical methods of spinal stiffness assessment can be expensive, time consuming and/or unsuited to clinical practice. While a new device has been designed to address these issues (VerteTrack), its benchtop performance remains unknown. AIM To measure the bench-top performance of VerteTrack. METHODS A series of laboratory-based experiments were conducted in February 2018 to investigate the accuracy (precision and bias) of load and displacement measurements obtained by VerteTrack and then were compared against an appropriate reference standard. Measurements of both multiple-level continuous assessment (multiple spinal levels measured), and single-level assessment (single spinal level measured) were performed on a viscoelastic foam medium (AIREX? balance beam, Switzerland) and the resulting stiffness calculated. RESULTS VerteTrack demonstrated high precision at all loads and displacements. There was minimal systematic measurement bias identified for applied versus reference load (mean bias = - 0.123 N; 95%CI - 0.182 to 0.428 N, p < .001), and no systematic measurement bias for measured versus reference displacement (mean difference = 0.02 mm; 95%CI - 0.09 to 0.14 mm, p < .001). The magnitude of stiffness obtained during multiple-level continuous assessment was on average 0.25 N/mm (2.79%) less than that for single-level assessment (95%CI - 0.67 to 0.17 N/mm, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS VerteTrack demonstrated high accuracy (high precision, low bias) under bench-top conditions. The difference in stiffness found between multiple versus single spinal levels should be considered in the research context, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The results of this study demonstrate that VerteTrack may be suitable for both single and multi-level spinal stiffness measurements in-vivo.","output":"The bench-top accuracy of the VerteTrack spinal stiffness assessment device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klebsiella pneumoniae causes various human infections.

The T (both class I and class II) and B (both linear and conformational) epitopes of FepA were predicted using prediction tools. The predicted epitopes were screened for human similarity, immunogenicity, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, conservancy, structural and physicochemical suitability, and in case of T epitopes binding to HLA alleles, using numerous immune-informatics, homology modeling, and molecular docking approaches.

Despite the availability of vaccines or antiviral drugs, personal hygiene is considered as effective means as the first-hand measure against viral infections. The green tea catechins, in particular, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are known to exert potent antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated the green tea extract as a safe personal hygiene against viral infections. RESULTS: Using the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a model, we examined the duration of the viral inactivating activity of green tea extract (GTE) under prolonged storage at various temperature conditions. Even after the storage for 56 days at different temperatures, 0.1% GTE completely inactivated 10(6) PFU of the virus (6 log(10) reduction), and 0.01% and 0.05% GTE resulted in 2 log(10) reduction of the viral titers. When supplemented with 2% citric acid, 0.1% sodium benzoate, and 0.2% ascorbic acid as anti-oxidant, the inactivating activity of GTE was temporarily compromised during earlier times of storage. However, the antiviral activity of the GTE was steadily recovered up to similar levels with those of the same concentrations of GTE without the supplements, effectively prolonging the duration of the virucidal function over extended period. Cryo-EM and DLS analyses showed a slight increase in the overall size of virus particles by GTE treatment. The results suggest that the virucidal activity of GTE is mediated by oxidative crosslinking of catechins to the viral proteins and the change of physical properties of viral membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The durability of antiviral effects of GTE was examined as solution type and powder types over extended periods at various temperature conditions using human influenza A/H1N1 virus. GTE with supplements demonstrated potent viral inactivating activity, resulting in greater than 4 log(10) reduction of viral titers even after storage for up to two months at a wide range of temperatures.

In this scenario, there is only one example from each individual on which to train the system, making it difficult to identify persons in unconstrained environments, mainly when dealing with changes in facial expression, posture, lighting, and occlusion. This paper discusses the relevance of an original method for SSFR, called Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Image Features (MB-C-BSIF), which exploits several kinds of features, namely, local, regional, global, and textured-color characteristics. First, the MB-C-BSIF method decomposes a facial image into three channels (e.g., red, green, and blue), then it divides each channel into equal non-overlapping blocks to select the local facial characteristics that are consequently employed in the classification phase. Finally, the identity is determined by calculating the similarities among the characteristic vectors adopting a distance measurement of the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Extensive experiments on several subsets of the unconstrained Alex and Robert (AR) and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases show that the MB-C-BSIF achieves superior and competitive results in unconstrained situations when compared to current state-of-the-art methods, especially when dealing with changes in facial expression, lighting, and occlusion.

METHODS Two heated humidifiers were evaluated: Fisher & Paykel MR850, and Covidien Kendall Aerodyne 2000. Baseline measurements were taken in all experimental conditions without humidification. The Boussignac valve was adapted to the input of the humidification chamber. The system was connected to a test lung to assess the degree of pressurization. Hygrometric and pressure measurements were performed with the following gas flows: 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min. RESULTS The mean values of pressure generated by the Boussignac valve were 1.99  0.02, 6.97  0.05, 16.61  0.08 and 21.24  0.08 cm H2O, 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min, respectively, no differences being detected between study groups. Overall absolute humidity was significantly greater with a heated humidifier than without humidification (range 40.01  0.57-25.46  0.49 compared to 0.16  0.13 mgH2O/L, P < .001). Absolute humidity was significantly higher in Kendall Aerodyne 2000 compared to MR850, regardless of the selected temperature and flow (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS This new method of Boussignac CPAP humidification yielded humidity values above 25 mg H2O/L regardless of the heated humidifier and flow used. Pressurization values remained constant in each experimental situation and were not influenced by adding humidification. These data open up the possibility of using Boussignac CPAP on different types of patients, with different interfaces and for long periods of time.","output":"Active humidification with Boussignac CPAP: in vitro study of a new method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has impacted the primary management of cardiac conditions worldwide, decreasing the number of interventions for coronary diseases.

The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex? test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The new silicone elastometric half-piece respirator, VJR-NMU: A novel and effective tool to prevent COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the health impact of COVID-19 in most African countries appears modest, the impact of social distancing measures, closing of markets and reduced mobility is felt across the board Domestic, labor-intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders In this study, we have used pre- and during-shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder-owned organizations are We find that many organizations could not countervail market-disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic One reason for this is that collective decision-making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business-orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital","output":"Agricultural Cooperatives and COVID-19 in Southeast Africa.

Many scholars have tried to make sense of this, giving rise to diverse views about the causes of this phenomenon. Other scholars argue that men behave in this manner because of the high unemployment rate, as many businesses are struggling, due to a loss of revenue, as a result of COVID-19, and the governments lockdown measures. Other perspectives from different quarters indicate that GBV is due to stress and many other mental conditions, as a South African dwindling economy has impacted on families and caused losses of jobs and businesses closing. This is not the first time that the country has experienced these high cases of GBV. Over the years, men have and continue to commit heinous crimes and abuse each other, as well as women and children. This raises a question: Is this violence not a reaction by men to their role as heads of families and their socialisation by the African culture and Christian religion that teaches men to be heads of their households?

One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis, which can mitigate sparsity and noise, and improve interpretation and power, by aggregating expression data to the pathway level. Unfortunately, methods optimized for bulk transcriptomics perform poorly on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific techniques has been limited. Importantly, no existing methods support cell-level gene set inference. To address this challenge, we developed a new gene set testing method, Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that integrates with the Seurat framework and can accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both data visualization and statistical enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, both population and cell-level inference is supported. As demonstrated using simulated and real scRNA-seq data, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.","output":"Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM): a fast and accurate method for cell-specific gene set scoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS OF THE STUDY: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overlap with the seasonal influenza epidemic, increasing the risk of overextending the health system capacity in Switzerland. Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents&rsquo; intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS: Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS: The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between &ldquo;German&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland were found for parents&rsquo; intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p &lt;0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents&rsquo; intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland.

Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status.

Studies were assessed for import and included if considered impactful for benefit:risk assessment. Results These searches led to inclusion of 12 in vitro and animal reports; 12 retrospective-observational trials, 19 interventional clinical trials (17 RCTs, 1 single-arm, 1 controlled but unblinded), and 51 meta-analyses in hospitalized patients. Inconsistent efficacy was seen in vitro and in animal studies for coronaviruses and nil in SARS-CoV-2 animal models specifically.

COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence.

Demographic data, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, radiological data, the result of nucleic acid test, and treatments were collected and analyzed. Results: Among 1,682 patients with confirmed non-critically ill COVID-19, 509 patients (30.3%) had neurological symptoms, including myalgia (311, 18.5%), headache (216, 12.8%), fatigue (83, 4.9%), and dizziness (15, 0.9%). One hundred and fourteen patients (6.8%) were the expansion of pulmonary infection according to their chest CT images and medical history. Compared with patients without neurological symptoms, patients with neurological symptoms had a significantly longer length of hospital stay, time of nucleic acid turning negative, and the mean time from onset of symptom to hospital admission (p < 0.05). Patients with neurological symptoms were more likely to occur the expansion of pulmonary infection compared with the patients without neurological symptoms (46/509 [9.0%] vs. 68/1,173 [5.8%]). Conclusions: Non-critically ill COVID-19 patients commonly have neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms are significantly associated with the processes of COVID-19. Early identification and aggressive treatment are particularly important for COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms.","output":"Neurological Implications of Non-critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the midst of an ongoing opioid epidemic. To offset disruption to life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), several federal agencies granted exemptions to existing federal regulations. This included loosening restrictions on medications for OUD (MOUD), including methadone and buprenorphine. In this commentary, we briefly review policy and practice guidelines for treating OUD prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline specific MOUD treatment policy and practice exemptions that went into effect in February and March 2020, and discuss the ways in which these unprecedented changes have dramatically changed MOUD treatment. Given the unprecedented nature of these changes, and unknown outcomes to date, we advocate for a data-driven approach to guide future policy and practice recommendations regarding MOUD.

Thus, our aim was to assess, in a cohort of patients regularly followed up in a devoted outpatient clinic of Southern Italy, the association between their gastrointestinal symptoms changes, stress, and anxiety reported during the Italian lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients from the outpatient clinic of the University of Salerno, devoted to functional gastrointestinal disorders, selecting only patients for whom an evaluation was available in the last 6 months before the lockdown. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at each visit through standardized questionnaire and pooled in a database. On 45th days from the beginning of the lockdown, patients were re-assessed by phone with the same questionnaire. Anxiety and stress levels were assessed through a self-administered online questionnaire based on Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 test and Perceived Stress Scale 10 test. KEY RESULTS: The intensity-frequency scores of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms improved (Wilcoxon test <0.05). Higher anxiety levels had a higher risk of worsening chest pain (OR 1.3 [1.1-1.7]), waterbrash (OR 1.3 [1.0-1.7]), epigastric burning (OR 1.3 [1.0-1.6]), and abdominal pain (OR 1.6 [1.0-2.3]). When compared to the interval preceding the outbreak, half of the patients declared their symptoms remained unchanged, 13.6% worsened, and 36.4% improved.

Suicide is a cause of maternal death and suicidal ideation is a key factor in suicidal behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the third trimester and associated predictors including psychological factors such as attachment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 432 pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy was conducted in a tertiary hospital. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess prenatal depression and suicidal ideation. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Experience of Close Relationship (ECR) scale were used to assess anxiety and attachment respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that the EPDS scale screened 6.71% of pregnant women with suicidal ideation. Compared with those without suicidal ideation, pregnant women with suicidal ideation had a higher prevalence of insecure attachment, higher scores on the two dimensions of attachment (attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety), and higher prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety. Binary logistic regression showed that marital satisfaction was a protective factor for suicidal ideation, while prenatal depression, prenatal anxiety and attachment anxiety were risk factors for suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The suicidal ideation among pregnant women was high, which should be given more attention. In the process of preventing and intervening suicidal ideation, in addition to the emotional state of pregnant women, their psychological factors such as attachment anxiety should also be considered.","output":"The prevalence of suicide ideation and predictive factors among pregnant women in the third trimester"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ensuring proper dosage of treatment and repetition over time is a major challenge in neurorehabilitation. However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patient's or pathology's specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patient's performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.","output":"Telerehabilitation in response to constrained physical distance: an opportunity to rethink neurorehabilitative routines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness with fatality rates of 50C100%.

To date, no investigation has examined dream activity specifically in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: As part of the International COVID-19 Sleep Study (ICOSS), we compared 544 COVID-19 participants with 544 matched-controls. A within-subjects comparison between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods computed separately for controls and COVID-19 participants were performed on dream recall and nightmare frequency (DRF; NF). Also, non-parametric comparisons between controls and COVID-19 participants were carried out. Further, we compared psychological measures between the groups collected during pandemic. Ordinal logistic regression to detect the best predictors of NF was performed. RESULTS: We found that people reported greater dream activity during the pandemic. Comparisons between controls and COVID-19 participants revealed a) no difference between groups concerning DRF in the pre-pandemic period and during the pandemic; b) no difference between groups concerning nightmare frequency in the pre-pandemic period; and c) COVID-19 participants reported significantly higher NF than controls during pandemic (p = 0.003). Additionally, we showed that a) anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) symptom scores were higher in COVID-19 participants than controls; and b) quality of life and health as well as wellbeing (WHO-5) scores were significantly higher in controls than COVID-19 participants. Finally, ordinal logistic regression indicates that DRF (p < 0.001), PTSD (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.018), insomnia (p = 0.039), COVID-19 severity (p = 0.014), sleep duration (p = 0.003) and age (p = 0.001) predicted NF. DISCUSSION: Our work shows strong associations between increased nightmares in those reporting having had COVID-19. This suggests that the more that people were affected by COVID-19, the greater the impact upon dream activity and quality of life.","output":"Nightmares in People with COVID-19: Did Coronavirus Infect Our Dreams?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper reconstructs the FamaCFrench three-factor (FCF) model as a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) framework to investigate the differentiated effects of investor sentiment proxies-the volatility index (VIX), credit default swap (CDS), and TED spread-on the three risk premiums.

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted.

This study aims to analyze the levels of three major pollutants: particulate matter sized 2.5 m (PM2.5) and 10 m (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) before and during the lockdown in Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities. The data for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations are derived from 38 ground stations dispersed within the city. The spatial interpolation maps of pollutants for two times are generated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) model. The results indicate decreasing levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations in the city by 93%, 83%, and 70% from 25 February 2020 to 21 April 2020 respectively. It is found that one month before the lockdown the levels of air pollution in Delhi were critical and much higher than the guideline values set by the World Health Organization. The levels of air pollution became historically low after the lockdown. Considering the critically degraded air quality for decades and higher morbidity and mortality rate due to unhealthy air in Delhi, the improvement in air quality due to lockdown may result as a boon for the better health of the city's population.","output":"Assessing the immediate effect of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality: a case study of Delhi, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are highly prevalent, genetically diverse, and associated with both mild upper respiratory tract and more severe lower tract illnesses (LRTI). OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray?) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5 noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRVC than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1.03-5.35).

Throughout the pandemic, there was a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of several sexually transmitted infections. However, the impact of the ongoing pandemic on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection rates has not been investigated thus far. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data regarding HPV and cervical cancer screening results of outpatients from gynecological clinics of a tertiary hospital from 1 December 2018 to 31 December 2020 in Wuhan. Based on the timeline of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Wuhan, we divided this period into four relatively independent stages to compare the HPV screening visit numbers and infection rates. RESULTS: There was a 50% drop in HPV screening visits and a 10% drop in HPV infection rates throughout the pandemic when compared with the numbers collected before the pandemic. Strict lockdown measures greatly decreased the HPV infection rate (17.03 vs. 8.29, P = 0.003). During the pandemic, the most prevalent HPV genotypes were HPV 16, 52, 58, and 53. After the pandemic, the HPV infection rate recovered quickly, but it was still slightly lower than the infection rate found before the outbreak (23.3 vs. 21.2%). CONCLUSION: During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cervical cancer screening visits and HPV infection rates have decreased dramatically. The HPV transmission has also decreased after strict lockdown.

With the proportion of older adults rapidly increasing in developed countries, age-dependent sepsis vulnerability is an urgent medical issue. Due to an increasing life expectancy, postsepsis complications and health care costs are expected to increase as well. Recent Advances: Older patients suffer from higher sepsis incidence and mortality rates, likely resulting from frequent comorbidities, increased coagulation, dysgylcemia, and altered immune responses. Critical Issues: Despite a large number of ongoing clinical and basic research studies, there is currently no effective therapeutic strategy targeting older patients with severe sepsis. The disparity between clinical and basic studies is a problem, and this is largely due to the use of animal models lacking clinical relevance. Although the majority of sepsis cases occur in older adults, most laboratory animals used for sepsis research are very young. Further, despite the wide use of combination fluid and antibiotic treatment in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, most animal research does not include such treatment.

This paper reports on responses of zirconia materials with distinct microstructures to nanoindentation associated with diamond machining using a Berkovich diamond indenter. In-situ nanoindentation was performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in-process filmed to record small contact events. Indentation morphology was SEM-mapped at high-magnifications. Although both pre-sintered porous and sintered dense zirconia materials mechanically revealed the quasi-plastic behavior in indentation, there were distinct responses of the two materials to quasi-plasticity at the microstructural level. For pre-sintered porous zirconia, the quasi-plasticity was attributed to shear faults resulting from breaking pore networks as microstructurally discrete interfaces, to lead to compression, fragmentation, pulverization and microcracking of zirconia crystals in indentation imprints. In contrast, sintered dense zirconia had shear band-induced quasi-plastic deformation, accompanied with localized tensile microfracture. A material index associated with the mechanical properties ranked the lower quasi-plasticity for pre-sintered porous zirconia than its sintered dense state, predicting more machining-induced damage in the former than the latter. Significantly higher indentation imprint volumes induced in indented pre-sintered porous zirconia than sintered dense state previses higher machining efficiency for the former than the latter. The microstructure-dependent indentation mechanisms provide the fundamental knowledge into micromechanics of abrasive machining of zirconia materials and may lead to a new microstructural design for zirconia materials to achieve a balanced machining efficiency and damage control.","output":"Microstructural responses of Zirconia materials to in-situ SEM nanoindentation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: There is an unmet need for effective treatments for suicidality in mental disorders. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has been investigated as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, a known effective treatment for suicidality, in the management of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, with promising findings. Yet, there are very limited data on the association of MST with suicidality directly. It is important to explore the potential of MST as a viable treatment alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for suicidality. Objective: To determine the association of MST with suicidality in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nonrandomized controlled trial took place at a single tertiary care psychiatric facility in Canada. It followed an open-label study design with consecutive treatment cohorts. Consecutive groupings of 67 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and with baseline suicidality present were treated for up to 24 treatments. The study was run from February 2012 through June 2019. Patients were followed up for 6 months at the end of the treatment period. This post hoc secondary analysis of the trial was performed from January to November 2019. Interventions: MST was delivered at 100% stimulator output over the prefrontal cortex with low (25 Hz), moderate (50 or 60 Hz), or high (100 Hz) frequency, for a maximum of 24 sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Remission from suicidality was measured as an end point score of 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. A linear mixed model was used to assess the trajectory of Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores. Results: A total of 67 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [13.6] years; 40 women [60.0%]) received a mean (SD) of 19.5 (5.1) MST treatments. The overall number of patients achieving remission was 32 (47.8%). Sixteen patients (55.2%) receiving low-frequency MST achieved remission, as well as 12 patients (54.5%) in the moderate-frequency group, and 4 patients (25.0%) in the high-frequency group. The linear mixed model revealed an association of time with Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores (F8,293.95 = 5.73; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that MST may be an effective treatment for suicidality, and sensitivity analysis shows this may be particularly so at low and moderate frequencies. Future studies should directly compare MST with electroconvulsive therapy for treating suicidality and should evaluate MST as a treatment for suicidality across mental disorders.

Methods Eighty-two patients referred to the Complex Musculoskeletal Clinic in the Rheumatology Department with a resulting diagnosis of fibromyalgia were included in the audit. Data was collected retrospectively via Electronic Patient Records over the study period of December 2017 to March 2020. Variables assessed included patient demographics, clinical presentation at assessment and management. Statistical analyses were conducted using Excel 2019 and the Excel Analysis ToolPak. Results The majority of the patients were female 77/82(94%), and the mean age was 43.2yrs (SD = 12.6). Co-morbidities were common: 31/82 (38%) had a further painful musculoskeletal condition, 40/82 (49%) were obese and 46/82 (56%) had an active mental health problem. Alongside chronic widespread pain, patients reported fatigue 64/82 (78%), waking unrefreshed 69/82 (84%), and cognitive disturbance 31/82 (38%). Compared to a 2014 audit conducted in the same population and department, more patients had received pharmacological treatment (71/82 [87%] vs 34/50 [68%]; z = 2.64, p = 0.008), had received physiotherapy (28/82 [34%] vs 5/50 [10%]; z = 3.0, p = 0.002) and psychological input (16/82 [20%] vs 3/50 [6%]; z = 2.20, p = 0.03) prior to referral to secondary care. At secondary care consultation, all patients received an assessment of their pain and function, and 64/82 (78%) were assessed for psychosocial context. Fifty-three (65%) patients received information in the form of a website recommendation, leaflet or verbal education. After clinician assessment, the majority were referred to a multidisciplinary pain management programme, in a significant increase from 2014 (64/82 [78%] vs 4/50 [8%]; z = 8.04, p < 0.0001). All medication recommendations were made according to 2017 EULAR guidelines. Alongside multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation, patients were referred to physiotherapy 21/82 (26%), physical activity 26/82 (26%), sleep hygiene 9/82 (11%) and psychological 7/82 (9%) treatment options. Conclusion Multidisciplinary treatment and first-line, non-pharmacological approaches have become the standard management approach in secondary care, alongside EULAR compliant pharmacological recommendations. EULARs non-pharmacological recommendations of assessing not only pain, but function and psychosocial context occurs for the majority of patients. The limitation of consultation duration likely plays a role in whether psychosocial context is adequately assessed. Providing patients with information about their condition, though occurring for approximately 2/3 of patients, was recognized as an area for improvement. The high rate of co-morbidities combined with the demographics of Fibromyalgia patients emphasizes the importance of early, multimodal management.

METHODS This cross-sectional study collected data from travelers to Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, in winter 2008, via a health questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS Forms were returned by 15 976 (68%) travelers. Of these, 17% reported at least 1 influenza symptom, with runny or blocked nose (10%) and cough (8%) most common. Respiratory specimens were obtained from 3769 travelers. Estimated prevalence of influenza was 1.1% (4% among symptomatic, 0.2% among asymptomatic). The sensitivity of screening criteria ranged from 84% for \\"any symptom\\" to 3% for a fever of 37.8 C or greater. The positive predictive value was low for all criteria. CONCLUSIONS Border screening using self-reported symptoms and temperature testing has limitations for preventing pandemic influenza from entering a country. Using \\"any symptom\\" or cough would lead to many uninfected people being investigated, yet some infected people would remain undetected. If more specific criteria such as fever were used, most infected people would enter the country despite screening.","output":"Effectiveness of border screening for detecting influenza in arriving airline travelers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule that regulates diverse physiological processes. The therapeutic potential of CO is hampered by its intrinsic toxicity, and its administration poses a significant challenge. Photoactivatable CO-releasing molecules (photoCORMs) are an excellent tool to overcome the side effects of untargeted CO administration and provide precise spatial and temporal control over its release. Here, we studied the CO release mechanism of a small library of derivatives based on 3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-4H-benzo[g]chromen-4-one (flavonol), previously developed as an efficient photoCORM, by steady-state and femto/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies. The main objectives of the work were to explore in detail how to enhance the efficiency of CO photorelease from flavonols, bathochromically shift their absorption bands, control their acid-base properties and solubilities in aqueous solutions, and minimize primary or secondary photochemical side-reactions, such as self-photooxygenation. The best photoCORM performance was achieved by combining substituents, which simultaneously bathochromically shift the chromophore absorption spectrum, enhance the formation of the productive triplet state, and suppress the singlet oxygen production by shortening flavonol triplet-state lifetimes.

Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses. MethodsAn individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case. ResultsMultiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission. Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost. ConclusionsA SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment.

We propose that the social identity approach to health and the Social Identity Model of Identity Change (SIMIC) could be a foundation for digital interventions to address loneliness. While SIMIC applies to maintaining wellbeing during life transitions, it has not previously been rigorously applied to digital interventions. There are known challenges to integrating psychological theory to the design of digital technology, such as efficacy, user-autonomy, and engagement. The interdisciplinary field of Human Computer Interaction has a history of drawing on models originating from psychology to improve the design of digital technology and to design technologies in an appropriate manner.

Abnormal neuroimaging findings were categorized as (1) cerebral microhemorrhages, (2) acute spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), (3) acute to subacute infarcts, and (4) encephalitis or encephalopathy. Pooled incidences of neuroimaging findings were assessed using random-effects modeling. Between-study heterogeneity was explored by using the &#967;2 statistic for pooled incidences and the inconsistency index I2. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. Subgroup meta-regression analysis was performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible papers, including 2125 patients, were identified. The pooled incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages, acute spontaneous ICH, acute/subacute infarcts, and encephalitis/encephalopathy were 6.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4.9 %-8.9 %), 5.4 % (95 % CI, 3.1 %-7.6 %), 24.0 % (95 % CI, 16.1 %-31.8 %), and 3.3 % (95 % CI, 1.9 %-4.7 %), respectively.

As cervical cancer screening programmes were adjusting to the new situation, we evaluated the intensity, quality, and outcomes of cervical cancer screening in Slovenia in the first seven months of the pandemic. METHODS: Historical observational study on data from a population-based cervical cancer screening registry. Number of cervical cytopathology (screening and follow-up), histopathology (diagnostic procedures, invasive procedures and number of newly diagnosed CIN2+ cases) and HPV test results from the entire Slovenian women population between January 1st and September 30th 2020 were compared to a three-year average of the years 2017C19. FINDINGS: A two-month screening lock-down between March 12th and May 8th 2020 resulted in an epidemic deficit of screening (-92%), follow-up (-70%), and HPV triage tests (-68%), as well as invasive diagnostic (-47%) and treatment (-15%) of cervical lesions. Time to diagnosis and treatment did not increase; times to laboratory results fluctuated but stayed within standards. Slovenia has entered the second epidemic intending to add as little as possible to the pandemic deficit of screening smears (-23%) and yearly CIN2+ cases (-10%). Women aged 30C39 were most affected, with the highest pandemic deficit of screening smears (-26%) and yearly CIN2+ cases (-19%). INTERPRETATION: The pandemic has deeply affected all levels of our lives. New vulnerable groups and inequalities have emerged that require recognition and action. To prevent long-term increases in the cervical cancer burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that organised screening is maintained and monitored in settings where it can be safely and comprehensively provided.

We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of newborns born to women infected with COVID-19. A multicenter cohort study was conducted among newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 in 34 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Turkey. Pregnant women (n = 125) who had a positive RT-PCR test and their newborns were enrolled. Cesarean section, prematurity, and low-birthweight infant rates were 71.2%, 26.4%, and 12.8%, respectively. Eight of 125 mothers (6.4%) were admitted to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation, among whom six died (4.8%). Majority of the newborns (86.4%) were followed in isolation rooms in the NICU. Four of 120 newborns (3.3%) had a positive RT-PCR test result. Although samples taken on the first day were negative, one neonate became positive on the second day and the other two on the fifth day.

Serologic prevalence was high for murine cytomegalovirus (99%, n = 94), murine coronavirus (95%), and murine rotavirus (74%). Samples from mice collected at all sites contained antibody to these viruses. The serologic prevalence was lower for mouse adenovirus, strain K87 (37%), parvovirus (33%), and reovirus type 3 (28%), with substantial site-to-site variation. Plasma from mice collected at 12 sites contained mouse adenovirus or reovirus antibody, and samples from mice at eight sites contained parvovirus antibody. Parvovirus-antibody positive mice were typically from high density populations or from low density populations that had recently declined from high density. Antibody to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Sendai virus occurred at only three sites, and the serologic prevalence was very low (9.6% and 1.8%, respectively). All of the LCMV-positive mice were from northeastern New South Wales. The presence of this zoonotic virus in a mouse plague-prone region raises questions about human health risks resulting from cohabitation with large numbers of mice. It appeared that mouse populations at high density or declining from high density had higher prevalence of viral antibody than populations that had been at low or moderate density for some time. Thus, viral epizootics may occur among high-density populations and may be responsible for or precipitate declines in mouse density.

This meant that there were no fans in attendance, games played on neutral courts and no traveling for teams, which in theory removes home-court advantage from the games. This setting has attracted much discussion as analysts and fans debated the possible effects it may have on the outcome of games. Home-court advantage has historically played an influential role in NBA playoff series outcomes. The 2020 playoff provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of the bubble and home-court advantage by comparing the 2020 season with the seasons in the past. While many factors contribute to the outcome of games, points scored is the deciding factor of who wins games, so scoring is the primary focus of this study. The specific measures of interest are team scoring totals and team shooting percentage on two-pointers, three-pointers, and free throws. Comparing these measures for home teams and away teams in 2020 vs. 2017-2019 shows that the 2020 playoffs favored away teams more than usual, particularly with two point shooting and total scoring.","output":"The Effects of the NBA COVID Bubble on the NBA Playoffs: A Case Study for Home-Court Advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The results of the analysis of psychopathological symptom dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia are presented.

METHODS We analyzed 92 individuals (44 male), 49 (607y) type 2 DM non-insulin dependents and 43 prediabetics (434y), with Grade I-II hypertension and no symptoms of CAD. All type 2 DM patients were under antidiabetic treatment with an A1C hemoglobin between 5.5 and 6.5%. Every patient underwent a myocardial perfusion SPECT scan.

Evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence mRNA expression to induce GC progression. We aim to investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of TP73-AS1 in GC. Materials and methods: We detected TP73-AS1, miR-27b-3p, and TMED5 (Transmembrane P24 Trafficking Protein 5) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Similarly, the protein levels of TMED5 and wnt/-catenin were detected by western-blot. The colony formation and Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay detected cell proliferation. Transwell and scrape assay tested cell migration and invasion. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed directed binding targets. Tumor xenograft in nude mice checked the result in vivo. Results: TP73-AS1 over-expressed in GC. Suppressed TP73-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, down-regulated miR-27b-3p could reverse the effects of weakenTP73-AS1 on the progression of GC. Moreover, TMED5 was also up-regulated in GC. Both TP73-AS1 and TMED5 were the direct target of miR-27b-3p. Meanwhile, miR-27b-3p was a negative correlation with TP73-AS1 and TMED5. The TP73-AS1/miR-27b-3p/TMED5 axis regulate wnt/-catenin pathway. Conclusion: TP73-AS1 promoted GC proliferation, migration, and invasion by sponging miR-27b-3p to regulate TMED5.

We sought to identify all potentially deleterious drug groups in COVID-19 and critically assess the underpinning strength of evidence pertaining to the harmful effects of these drugs. Methods and findings: We performed a rapid systematic review, searching Medline, Embase and two COVID-19 portfolios (WHO COVID-19 database and NIH iSearch COVID-19 portfolio) for papers and preprints related to primary studies investigating drugs identified as potentially deleterious. Primary outcomes were direct measures of susceptibility to infection, disease severity and mortality. Study quality was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for data synthesis with further subgroup analyses where possible for specific outcome, study design, statistical adjustment and drug groups when two were combined. Sensitivity analyses were performed by removing any studies at high risk of bias and by publication status. 49 observational studies (15 peer-reviewed papers and 34 preprints) reported primary outcomes for eight drug groups hypothesised to be deleterious. Meta-analysis showed that acute inpatient corticosteroid use was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.90), however this result appeared to have been biased by confounding via indication. One subgroup analysis indicated an association between immunosuppressant use and susceptibility to COVID-19 among case control and cross-sectional studies (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40) but this was not found with cohort studies (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.43). Studies which adjusted for multiple confounders showed that people taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-II-receptor blockers (ARBs) required a lower level of care (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98). Furthermore, studies which combined these two drug groups in their analysis demonstrated an association with a lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.85). Conclusions: We found minimal high quality or consistent evidence that any drug groups increase susceptibility, severity or mortality in COVID-19. Converse to initial hypotheses, we found some evidence that regular use of ACEIs and ARBs prior to infection may be effective in reducing the level of care required, such as requiring intensive care, in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Deleterious drugs in COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are suspected of significant roles in autoimmune diseases but the mechanisms are unclear. We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the X chromosomeCnucleolus nexus hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","output":"Viral Impact in Autoimmune Diseases: Expanding the X ChromosomeCNucleolus Nexus Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acceptance of a vaccine or hesitancy has great public health implications as these partly determine the extent to which people are exposed to infections that could have otherwise been prevented. There is a high need for a more updated understanding of the behavioral intention of the public toward COVID-19 vaccines and associated factors in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to give appropriate public health messages or actions. Thus, the study aimed to assess behavioral intention and its predictors toward COVID-19 vaccine among people most at risk of exposure in Ethiopia. A population-based anonymous online survey was conducted on individuals aged greater than 18 years from May 01, 2021 to June 30, 2021. The data were collected using a convenient sampling method through an online self-administered, structured questionnaire that was created onto Google survey tool (Google Forms) and disseminated to the public on different social media channels through online sharable platforms. Descriptive statistics were done. Bivariateand multivariable logistic regression was done to show the association of behavioral intention toward the COVID-19 vaccine. The associations of variables were declared with the use of 95% CI and P-value. A total of 1080 participants were included in this survey. Seven hundred one (64.9%) of the respondents had a behavioral intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Males (AOR = 1.41 (95% CI = 1.004-2.53)), degree in level of education (AOR = 0.815 (95% CI = 0.254-0.916)), good knowledge (AOR = 4.21 (95% CI = 2.871-6.992)), attitude (AOR = 2.78 (95% CI = 1.654-4.102)), subjective norm (AOR = 1.214 (95% CI = 1.008-4.309)) and perceived behavioral control (AOR = 3.531 (95%CI = 1.689-5.201)) were found to be significantly associated with behavioral intention toward COVID-19 vaccine. Generally, the prevalence of behavioral intention in Ethiopia is low. Males, degree level of education, knowledge about vaccine, attitude toward vaccine subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were found to be significantly associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude, poor knowledge, and action need to improve or change the attitude and behavior of influential people within the community or organization to improve intention to take the vaccine.","output":"Behavioral intention and its predictors toward COVID-19 vaccination among people most at risk of exposure in Ethiopia: applying the theory of planned behavior model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After renal transplantation, there is a need for immunosuppressive regimens which effectively prevent allograft rejection, while preserving renal function and minimizing side effects.

Seventy patients were randomly assigned of which 57 patients were included in the final analysis (29 MSC; 28 controls). Quantitative progression of fibrosis failed to show benefit in the MSC group and GFR remained stable in both groups. One acute rejection was documented (MSC group), while subclinical rejection in week 24 protocol biopsies occurred in seven patients (four MSC; three controls). In the MSC group, regulatory T cell numbers were significantly higher compared to controls (p = .014, week 24).

Disease-overarching studies, and data on recall responses and third vaccinations are scarce. Our primary objective was to investigate the effects of immunosuppressive monotherapies on the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Methods We did a cohort study in participants treated in outpatient clinics in seven university hospitals and one rheumatology treatment centre in the Netherlands as well as participants included in two national cohort studies on COVID-19-related disease severity. We included patients aged older than 18 years, diagnosed with any of the prespecified immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, who were able to understand and complete questionnaires in Dutch. Participants with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders who were not on systemic immunosuppressants and healthy participants were included as controls. Anti-receptor binding domain IgG responses and neutralisation capacity were monitored following standard vaccination regimens and a three-vaccination regimen in subgroups. Hybrid immune responsesie, vaccination after previous SARS-CoV-2 infectionwere studied as a proxy for recall responses. Findings Between Feb 2 and Aug 1, 2021, we included 3222 participants in our cohort. Sera from 2339 participants, 1869 without and 470 participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were analysed (mean age 499 years [SD 137];1470 [628%] females and 869 [372%] males). Humoral responses did not differ between disorders. Anti-CD20 therapy, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators, and mycophenolate mofetil combined with corticosteroids were associated with lower relative risks for reaching seroconversion following standard vaccination (032 [95% CI 019C049] for anti-CD20 therapy, 035 [021C055] for S1P modulators, and 061 [040C090] for mycophenolate mofetil combined with corticosteroids). A third vaccination increased seroconversion for mycophenolate mofetil combination treatments (from 526% after the second vaccination to 895% after the third) but not significantly for anti-CD20 therapies (from 368% to 456%) and S1P modulators (from 355% to 484%). Most other immunosuppressant groups showed moderately reduced antibody titres after standard vaccination that did not increase after a third vaccination, although seroconversion rates and neutralisation capacity were unaffected. In participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were boosted after vaccination, regardless of immunosuppressive treatment. Interpretation Humoral responses following vaccination are impaired by specific immunosuppressants. After standard vaccination regimens, patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders taking most immunosuppressants show similar seroconversion to controls, although antibody titres might be moderately reduced. As neutralisation capacity and recall responses are also preserved in these patients, this is not likely to translate to loss of (short-term) protection. In patients on immunosuppressants showing poor humoral responses after standard vaccination regimens, a third vaccination resulted in additional seroconversion in patients taking mycophenolate mofetil combination treatments, whereas the effect of a third vaccination in patients on anti-CD20 therapy and S1P modulators was limited.

However, the relationship between informal care and health care use in urban and rural areas needs to be further explored. This study aimed to understand the association between informal care and health care utilisation for the elderly and explore how this effect may differ between urban and rural China. METHOD: A total of 5704 residents aged 65 years and above were selected from wave 3 (2015) and wave 4 (2018) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which is a nationally representative survey. A negative binomial regression model for the panel data was used to explore the relationship between informal care and health care utilisation. A fixed-effect binary choice model for panel data was used for the sensitivity test. RESULT: The elderly who received informal care had increased in outpatient and inpatient visits compared with those who did not receive informal care. The inpatient visits of the elderly who received 15-29 days of informal care was higher than the elderly who did not receive informal care (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.082, P < 0.05). Moreover, the elderly who received informal care for more than 30 days had 39.6% more inpatient visits (IRR = 1.396, P < 0.01) and 37.4% more outpatient visits than the elderly who did not receive informal care (IRR = 1.374, P < 0.05). For urban respondents, receiving informal care can facilitate outpatient use of the elderly, but for rural respondents, receiving informal care can predict an increase in outpatient and inpatient visits. CONCLUSION: Informal care was associated with higher use of health services. The association between informal care and health care utilisation varies between rural and urban residents. These findings indicate the role of informal care and remind that relevant departments should pay attention to the differences in medical service utilisation levels amongst different elderly groups.","output":"Effect of informal care on health care utilisation for the elderly in urban and rural China: evidence from China health and retirement longitudinal study (CHARLS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In some countries, telephone-based support is one of the key services used for supporting patients with cancer. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of this method in Iran.

Older adults and carers have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus (COVID\\\\19). With 410 00 people living in CH, we lack data of how these major changes have impacted CH, and how CH are managing during the pandemic outbreak. We require knowledge, including what policies and procedures CH currently have; how they are mitigating risks; and how current experiences and guidance can improve care of CH residents during the current pandemic and future crises. METHOD: CH members of the Care Home Research Network (CHRN) were invited to take part on an online anonymous survey. An email invitation was sent to 225 CH, with surveys completed between August to October 2020. The questionnaire comprised of 49 questions, focusing on CH details, their views of the impact on the CH, staff and residents, and questions exploring strategies, ideas, and guidelines that the CH followed. RESULT: Fifty care homes completed the survey. With 60% of the CH having between 10\\\\40 beds, and 40% between 50 to more than 100 beds. 76% of the respondents felt that their institution had been affected by the pandemic, with 52% having residents dying due to COVID\\\\19 and 68% had staff absent due to COVID\\\\19. 94% of respondents felt an increased level of stress in their role due to COVID\\\\19, with 22% saying that they could not cope with the increase in the workload and 52% hiring staff to cope with the workload. 70% of respondents felt that residents were feeling lonelier and 56% that residents were more depressed.

Through the co-removal experiments (SeO42- and common competing oxyanions co-existed) and the investigation of Se stability loaded on BC/Fe composites, the removal of SeO42- by BC/Fe500 through highly reversible adsorption could not achieve long-term immobilization of Se, making it an appropriate adsorbent for pre-treatment only, while the efficient reduction of SeO42- to Se0 by BC/Fe650 could largely improve its long-term stability. This study supplies a possible strategy for Se immobilization against common competing oxyanions.","output":"Exploring the role of Fe species from biochar-iron composites in the removal and long-term immobilization of SeO42- against competing oxyanions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the effect of lockdown against the coronavirus which is one of the fastest growing threats in the world We focus on three categories of lockdown and groups four continents, Asia, America, Europe, and Africa together to assess the effectiveness of such a measure to contain the virus We also look at a number of variables linked to the spread of the virus to determine the factors affecting the growth of new confirmed cases We show evidence that countries in Europe are more likely to impose a national lockdown than any other continent For the empirical analysis, we undertake the cross-sectional regression model, logistic regression model and logistic growth curve as a method to apply the data collected over the period March to June 2020 as this is the data available at the time this paper is composed The empirical results of this paper indicate that countries which impose the strictest form of lockdown will result in a reduction in growth of new confirmed cases","output":"Coronavirus lockdown and virus suppression: an international analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this systematic review of reviews was to synthesise the evidence on factors influencing the implementation, sustainability and scalability of food retail interventions to improve the healthiness of food purchased by consumers.

Authorship inequity has been a consistent feature of global health publications, with over-representation of authors from high-income countries (HICs), and disenfranchisement of researchers from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this study, we investigated authorship demographics within recently published global surgery literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of author characteristics, including gender, seniority and institutional affiliation, for global surgery studies published between 2016 and 2020 and indexed in the PubMed database. We compared the distribution of author gender and seniority across studies related to different topics; between authors affiliated with HICs and LMICs; and across studies with different authorship networks. RESULTS: 1240 articles were included for analysis. Most authors were male (60%), affiliated only with HICs (51%) and of high seniority (55% were fully qualified specialist or generalist clinicians, Principal Investigators, or in senior leadership or management roles). The proportion of male authors increased with increasing seniority for last and middle authors. Studies related to Obstetrics and Gynaecology had similar numbers of male and female authors, whereas there were more male authors in studies related to surgery (69% male) and Anaesthesia and Critical care (65% male). Compared with HIC authors, LMIC authors had a lower proportion of female authors at every seniority grade. This gender gap among LMIC middle authors was reduced in studies where all authors were affiliated only with LMICs. CONCLUSION: Authorship disparities are evident within global surgery academia. Remedial actions to address the lack of authorship opportunities for LMIC authors and female authors are required.","output":"Systematic analysis of authorship demographics in global surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": The purpose of this research was to verify the importance and performance of crisis management in Korean fitness center using Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA).

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) emerges as a compensatory mechanism used by neurons to adjust their excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity. Recently, glial cells emerged as modulators for neurotransmission by releasing gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through pathways that include P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), connexons, and pannexons. However, the role of gliotransmission in the activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength is still an open question. Here, we investigated whether glial cells participate in HSP upon chronic inactivity and the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), connexin43 hemichannels (Cx43HCs), and pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in this process. We used immunocytochemistry against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to estimate changes in synaptic strength in hippocampal dissociated cultures. Pharmacological manipulations indicate that glial-derived ATP and P2X7R are required for HSP. In addition, inhibition of Cx43 and Panx1 channels reveals a pivotal role for these channels in the compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength, emerging as new pathways for ATP release upon inactivity. The involvement of Panx1 channels was confirmed by using Panx1-deficient animals. Lacking Panx1 in neurons is sufficient to prevent the P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength; however, the P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density requires both neuronal and glial Panx1. Together, our data supports an essential role for glial ATP signaling and Cx43HCs and Panx1 channels in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength in hippocampal cultures upon chronic inactivity.","output":"Glial ATP and Large Pore Channels Modulate Synaptic Strength in Response to Chronic Inactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted cancer care worldwide. Disruptions have been seen across all facets of care. While the long-term impact of COVID-19 remains unclear, the immediate impacts on patients, their carers and the healthcare workforce are increasingly evident. This study describes disruptions and reorganisation of cancer services in Australia since the onset of COVID-19, from the perspectives of people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Two separate online cross-sectional surveys were completed by: a) cancer patients, survivors, carers, family members or friends (n = 852) and b) healthcare workers (n = 150). Descriptive analyses of quantitative survey data were conducted, followed by inductive thematic content analyses of qualitative survey responses relating to cancer care disruption and perceptions of telehealth. Overall, 42% of cancer patients and survivors reported experiencing some level of care disruption. A further 43% of healthcare workers reported atypical delays in delivering cancer care, and 50% agreed that patient access to research and clinical trials had been reduced. Almost three quarters (73%) of patients and carers reported using telehealth following the onset of COVID-19, with high overall satisfaction. However, gaps were identified in provision of psychological support and 20% of participants reported that they were unlikely to use telehealth again. The reorganisation of cancer care increased the psychological and practical burden on carers, with hospital visitation restrictions and appointment changes reducing their ability to provide essential support. COVID-19 has exacerbated a stressful and uncertain time for people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Service reconfiguration and the adoption of telehealth have been essential adaptations for the pandemic response, offering long-term value. However, our findings highlight the need to better integrate psychosocial support and the important role of carers into evolving pandemic response measures.

From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time, phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental size-effects.","output":"Piezoelectric domain walls in van der Waals antiferroelectric CuInP2Se6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the process of agricultural development, climate change in different regions will have different degrees of impact on the allocation and use of agricultural resources.

Assessing when these patients should be evaluated for COVID-19 can be difficult because they often have chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and sputum production, at baseline. Very little data exists on how patients with COPD present with COVID-19 and which symptoms are associated with a higher risk for COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the symptoms most associated with positive COVID-19 status in patients with COPD. METHODS We investigated 1468 patients with a diagnosis of COPD who were tested for COVID-19 using the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry from 03/8/2020 to 06/08/2020. Testing for COVID-19 at our facility was only indicated for symptomatic patients. We excluded individuals with the concurrent diagnosis of asthma, those with less than a 10 pack-year smoking history, and those 35 years of age and younger to minimize bias and uncertainty about the diagnosis of COPD. Results were analyzed via a multivariate logistic regression adjusted for gender, race, age, smoking status, and comorbidities associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection (diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and history of malignancy). RESULTS Out of a total of 1468 patients, 223 (15.2%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared to patients with COPD who tested negative, those who tested positive were more likely to endorse fatigue (62.0% vs 40.3%, p&lt;0.001), flu-like symptoms (57.6% vs 36.0%, p&lt;0.001), diarrhea (26.8% vs 17.2%, p=0.009), and loss of appetite (43.5% vs 14.1%, p&lt;0.001). Respiratory symptoms were commonly reported, but not significantly different compared to COVID negative patients (cough: 76.2% vs 75.3%, p=0.88;sputum production: 37.2% vs 32.9%, p=0.43;dyspnea: 75.3% vs 77.9%, p=0.53). When adjusted in multivariate logistic regression, COPD patients had higher odds of testing positive when reporting fatigue (adj OR 2.57, CI: 1.72-3.87), flu-like symptoms (adj OR 2.95, CI: 1.99-4.41), diarrhea (adj OR 2.05, CI: 1.31-3.16), or loss of appetite (adj OR 5.03, CI: 3.19-7.95). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we found that patients with COPD who were tested for COVID-19 demonstrated that constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms were more often associated with a positive COVID-19 test compared to respiratory symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of investigating additional symptoms other than respiratory in patients with COPD to help predict COVID-19 positivity. .","output":"Poster session symptoms associated with COVID-19 positive status in patients with COPD: Looking beyond dyspnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adoptive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T or NK cells (CAR-T/NK) have emerged as a novel form of disease treatment.

Methods: We analyzed characteristics of journal articles with original data indexed by March 19, 2020, in World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 collection, articles published on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv by April 3, 2010. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of clinical trials indexed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) by April 7, 2020. Results: Among the first 2118 articles on COVID-19 published in scholarly journals, 533 (25%) contained original data. The majority was published by authors from China (75%) and funded by Chinese sponsors (75%);a quarter was published in the Chinese language. Among 312 articles that self-reported study design, the most frequent were retrospective studies (N=88;28%) and case reports (N=86;28%), analyzing patients characteristics (38%). Median Journal Impact Factor of journals where articles were published was 5.099.Among 1088 analyzed preprint articles, the majority came from authors affiliated in China (51%) and were funded by sources in China (46%). Less than half reported study design;the majority were modeling studies (62%), and analyzed transmission/risk/prevalence (43%).Of the 927 analyzed registered trials, the majority were interventional (58%).

Materials and methods This was a descriptive study using publicly available data. The numbers of infectious disease (ID)-doctors and the certified nurses in infection control (CNIC) per 100,000 population in 47 prefectures in Japan were calculated. We then compared the detected proportions of AMR pathogens among the prefectures in 2019 to be employed as a comparative parameter, which was obtained from Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) data. Results The number of ID-doctors was the 11th( )highest in Japan; however, they were unevenly distributed in southern Okayama, particularly at three tertiary hospitals. While the deployment of CNIC was geographically less uneven in the prefecture, their number was lower than the domestic average.

In low-dimensional regimes, where the number of observations far exceeds the number of variables, the optimality of the sample covariance matrix as an estimator of this parameter is well-established. High-dimensional regimes do not admit such a convenience, however. As such, a variety of estimators have been derived to overcome the shortcomings of the sample covariance matrix in these settings. Yet, the question of selecting an optimal estimator from among the plethora available remains largely unaddressed. Using the framework of cross-validated loss-based estimation, we develop the theoretical underpinnings of just such an estimator selection procedure. In particular, we propose a general class of loss functions for covariance matrix estimation and establish finite-sample risk bounds and conditions for the asymptotic optimality of the cross-validated estimator selector with respect to these loss functions.

Supervised exercise that includes strength training can improve functional recovery after hip fracture. The role of testosterone replacement for augmenting the effects of exercise in older women after hip fracture is unknown. METHODS: The Starting Testosterone and Exercise after Hip Injury (STEP-HI) Study is a 6-month Phase 3 multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to compare supervised exercise (EX) plus 1% testosterone topical gel, with EX plus placebo gel, and with enhanced usual care (EUC). Female hip fracture patients age &#8805; 65 years are being recruited from clinical centers across the United States. Participants are community dwelling and enrolled within 24 weeks after surgical repair of the fracture. The EX intervention is a center-based program of progressive resistance training. The EUC group receives a home exercise program and health education. Participants receive dietary counseling, calcium and vitamin D. The primary outcome is the Six Minute Walk Distance. Secondary outcomes include physical performance measures, self-reported function and quality of life, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition and bone mineral density. RESULTS: Enrollment, interventions, and follow-up are ongoing. We describe the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the trial, including modifications made to allow continuation of the interventions and outcome data collection using remote video and audio technology.

Hate speech is topically focused (misogyny, sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.), and each specific manifestation of hate speech targets different vulnerable groups based on characteristics such as gender (misogyny, sexism), ethnicity, race, religion (xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia), sexual orientation (homophobia), and so on. Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing. Moreover, we prove that domain-independent affective knowledge, injected into our models, helps finer-grained hate speech detection.","output":"Emotionally Informed Hate Speech Detection: A Multi-target Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Surgical Council on Resident Education (SCORE) curriculum is aligned with the American Board of Surgery (ABS) objectives. Our program adopted the SCORE curriculum in 2015 following poor ABS In-Training Examination (ABSITE) performance and lowest quartile ABS Certifying Exam (CE) and Qualifying Exam (QE) first-time pass rates. We examined the association of SCORE utilization with ABSITE performance and ABS board exam first-time pass rate. METHODS At a single institution, a retrospective review of surgery residents' SCORE metrics and ABSITE percentile was conducted for academic year 2015 to 2019. Metrics analyzed on SCORE web portal were mean total minutes and total visits per resident for all residents using SCORE that year. First-time pass rates of the ABS QE and CE were examined from 2013 to 2019. Chi-square and linear regression analysis were performed, and a 95% level of confidence was assumed (alpha=.05). RESULTS Yearly data from categorical general surgery residents showed a significant increase in total minutes, total visits, and ABSITE percentile. Combined first time pass rates for the ABS QE and CE significant increased from 70.8% in 2013-2015 to 93.9% in 2016-2019 (p=0.018).

However, no international regulatory framework exists to monitor the trade of species not listed in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We explored the composition and dynamics of internationally regulated versus non-regulated trade, focussing on importations of wild-caught terrestrial vertebrates entering the United States of America (US) from 2009-2018. The prominence of the US in global wildlife imports and its detailed data collection conventions allows a unique opportunity to formally assess this substantial but often overlooked and understudied component of the legal wildlife trade. We found 3.6 times the number of unlisted species in US imports compared with CITES-listed species (1,366 versus 378). CITES-listed species were more likely to face reported conservation threats relative to the unlisted species (71.7% vs 27.5%). Yet, we found 376 unlisted species facing conversation threats, 297 species with unknown population trends and 139 species without an evaluation by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Unlisted species appeared novelly in imports at 5.5 times higher rates relative to CITES-listed species, where unlisted reptiles saw the largest rate of entry, averaging 53 unique species appearing in imports for the first time per year. Overall trade volumes were substantially larger for unlisted imports with approximately 11 times the number of animals relative to CITES-listed imports, however, import volumes were similar when compared at a species-by-species level. We found that the countries that were top exporters for CITES-listed shipments were mostly different from exporters of unlisted species.

The current therapy for GBM consists in concurrent radiation and chemotherapy following removal of the tumor. Although the therapy prolongs patient survival, recurrence often occurs. The major cause of tumor recurrence is thought to be GBM stem cells (GSCs), which aid the development of chemo-radiotherapy resistance, and can self-renew and aberrantly differentiate. Therefore, GSCs should be targeted to eradicate the tumor and prevent recurrence. Transcriptomic analysis has categorized GBM into proneural (PN), mesenchymal and classical subtypes, and the outcome of recurrence and prognosis markedly depends on subtype. To identify specific GSC markers, the present study analyzed public microarray and RNA-seq data and identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5 (DRP5) as a candidate GSC marker. DRP5 is known to mediate semaphorin 3A signaling and is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and axon guidance during neuronal development. In the present study, DRP5 was specifically upregulated in the PN-subtype GSCs and served crucial roles in maintaining GSC properties, including tumor sphere formation, stem cell marker expression and xenograft tumor growth. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed that DRP5 expression was positively correlated with signatures of stemness, including Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt/?-catenin expression, which are also known to be positively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Conversely, DRP5 expression was negatively correlated with NF-&#954;B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stemness signatures, which are negatively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Taken together, these findings suggested that DRP5 was specifically expressed in PN-subtype GSCs and may be used as a functional marker of PN-subtype GSCs.","output":"Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5 controls glioblastoma stem cell characteristics as a biomarker of proneural-subtype glioblastoma stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface chemistry is known to influence the formation, composition, and electroactivity of electron-conducting biofilms.

In the process of data collection, we included 33 PE distance learning lessons at the lower secondary level, where six pupils (3 girls and 3 boys) wore accelerometers in each lesson (n = 198 pupils). The results showed that the most effective model was the flipped learning teaching model, where pupils were given an overview in advance of the different forms of teacher video recordings. Then they also actively participated with their ideas in the performance of the online lesson. A statistically significantly less efficient version of the flipped learning teaching model had prepared interactive assignments and games. This was followed by a combination of online frontal teaching with station work and frontal teaching. The least effective was independent work carried out by the pupils according to the instructions prepared by the teacher. Although the two flipped learning teaching models were the most effective in terms of exercise intensity, it is very difficult to implement them in practice because they require too much teacher time.Alternate abstract:Epidemija virusa covid-19 je zaradi zaustavljanja javnega ?ivljenja in zapiranja ?ol mo?no vplivala na izvedbo celotnega pedago?kega procesa.

Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3? in 2019 to 4.2? in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

V(m)-dependent shifts of excitation and emission spectra establish two excitation bands (<481 and >481 nm) that produce fluorescence changes of opposite polarity within a single emission band (575-620 nm). The ratio of these positive and negative fluorescence signals (excitation ratiometry) increases V(m) sensitivity and removes artifacts common to both signals. We pulsed blue (450  10 nm) and cyan (505  15 nm) light emitting diodes (LEDs) at 375 Hz in alternating phase synchronized to a camera (750 frames-per-second). Fluorescence was bandpass filtered (585  20 nm). This produced signals with upright (blue) and inverted (cyan) action potentials (APs) interleaved in sequential frames. In four whole swine hearts with motion chemically arrested, fractional fluorescence for blue, cyan, and ratio signals was 1.2  0.3%, 1.2  0.3%, and 2.4  0.6%, respectively.

In the present study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an incomplete autophagy response, elevated autophagosome formation but impaired autophagosome maturation, and declined autophagy by genetic knockout of essential autophagic genes reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency. By screening 26 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that expression of ORF3a alone is sufficient to induce incomplete autophagy. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacts with autophagy regulator UVRAG to facilitate PI3KC3-C1 (Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14) but selectively inhibit PI3KC3-C2 (Beclin-1-Vps34-UVRAG). Interestingly, although SARS-CoV ORF3a shares 72.7% amino acid identity with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, the former had no effect on cellular autophagy response.

EXPOSURE: AKI. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: in-hospital death. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: requiring dialysis at discharge, recovery of kidney function. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 9,657 patients admitted with COVID-19, the AKI incidence rate was 38.4/1,000 patient-days. Incidence rates of in-hospital death among patients without AKI, with AKI not requiring dialysis (AKI stages 1-3), and with AKI receiving dialysis (AKI 3D) were 10.8, 31.1, and 37.5/1,000 patient-days, respectively.

Here, we report engineering principles and realization of a Protein-fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) detector of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by coupling two Abs to complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of the reporter enzyme Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). Both Abs display comparably high affinities for distinct epitopes of viral Spike (S)-protein trimers. Gluc activity is reconstituted when the Abs are simultaneously bound to S-protein bringing the Ab-fused N- and C-terminal fragments close enough together (8 nm) to fold. We thus achieve high specificity both by requirement of simultaneous binding of the two Abs to the S-protein and also, in a steric configuration in which the two Gluc complementary fragments can fold and thus reconstitute catalytic activity. Gluc activity can also be reconstituted with virus-like particles that express surface S-protein with detectable signal over background within 5 min of incubation. Design principles presented here can be readily applied to develop reporters to virtually any protein with sufficient available structural details.

To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach.

Little is known about how these disease control measures affected the 600 million people who live in rural China. The goal of this paper is to document the quarantine measures implemented in rural China outside the epicenter of Hubei Province and to assess the socioeconomic effect of the measures on rural communities over time. METHODS: We conducted three rounds of interviews with informants from 726 villages in seven provinces, accounting for over 25% of Chinas overall rural population. The survey collected data on rural quarantine implementation; COVID-19 infections and deaths in the survey villages; and effects of the quarantine on employment, income, education, health care, and government policies to address any negative impacts. The empirical findings of the work established that strict quarantine measures were implemented in rural villages throughout China in February. RESULTS: There was little spread of COVID-19 in rural communities: an infection rate of 0.001% and zero deaths reported in our sample. However, there were negative social and economic outcomes, including high rates of unemployment, falling household income, rising prices, and disrupted student learning. Health care was generally accessible, but many delayed their non-COVID-19 health care due to the quarantine measures. Only 20% of villagers received any form of local government aid, and only 11% of villages received financial subsidies. There were no reports of national government aid programs that targeted rural villagers in the sample areas. CONCLUSIONS: By examining the economic and social effects of the COVID-19 restrictions in rural communities, this study will help to guide other middle- and low-income countries in their containment and restorative processes. Without consideration for economically vulnerable populations, economic hardships and poverty will likely continue to have a negative impact on the most susceptible communities.

Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the distribution patterns of the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis of the imported cases, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing the interval. RESULTS A total of 179 imported cases were reported in Guangdong by April 10th, 2020. The average interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis was 4.21 days with a median of 2 days. The interval was between 1 and 3 days in 69.8% of the cases.

It is further recommended that to increase the perceived enjoyment of the students with the online learning, the lecturers might be encouraged to use videos, audios and instant messaging to contact and provide the feedback to the students. It is important for universities to prepare for any such future crisis.

The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) or M(pro)) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19.","output":"Progress in Developing Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3C-Like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which local inflammation and hyperactivity of the complement pathway have been implicated in its pathophysiology. This study explores whether any surrogate biomarkers are specifically associated with GA. Plasma from subjects with GA, intermediate dry AMD and non-AMD control were evaluated in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 was assayed in a 320-analyte Luminex library. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric and parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, partial least squares and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate ANCOVAs). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted and identified connections to the amyloid pathway. Statistically significant biomarkers identified in Cohort 1 were then re-evaluated in Cohort 2 using individual ELISA and multiplexing. Of 320 analytes in Cohort 1, 273 were rendered measurable, of which 56 were identified as changing. Among these markers, 40 were identified in univariate ANCOVAs. Serum amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) was analyzed by a separate ELISA and included in further analyses. The 40 biomarkers, sAPP and amyloid- (A) (1-42) (included for comparison) were evaluated in Cohort 2. This resulted in 11 statistically significant biomarkers, including sAPP and A(1-40), but not A(1-42). Other biomarkers identified included serum proteases- tissue plasminogen activator, tumor-associated trypsinogen inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 9, and non-proteases- insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, omentin, pentraxin-3 and osteopontin. Findings suggest that there is a preferential processing of APP to A(1-40) over A(1-42), and a potential role for the carboxylase activity of the -secretase protein, which preferentially splices sAPP to A(1-40). Other markers are associated with the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and loss of homeostasis, possibly within the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex. These data suggest novel disease pathways associated with GA pathogenesis and could provide potential novel targets for treatment of GA.","output":"Plasma biomarkers of the amyloid pathway are associated with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background RT-PCR is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers (HCW). As RT-PCR is not widely available and is time-consuming, it limits decision making on removal from and return to work of possibly contagious HCW. Aim In this study we evaluated the Panbio? COVID-19 Ag rapid test (PanbioCAgRT) in 825 hospital HCW. Methods and findings: This study consisted of two phases. In the validation phase, we tested hospital HCW with mild symptoms (three days or less) in parallel using the PanbioCAgRT and the RT-qPCR test. The PanbioCAgRT demonstrated 86.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 98.5% NPV with regard to RT-qPCR. For HCW with PanbioCAgRT-/RT-qPCR+, the median Ct value was 30.9, whereas for the HCW with PanbioCAgRT+/RT-qPCR+ the median Ct value was 19.3 (p<0.001). In the second phase, we implemented an on-site antigen test-based strategy for symptomatic hospital HCW: HCW that tested positive with the PanbioCAgRT on-site were considered SARS-CoV-2 positive and were sent home. HCW that tested negative with the PanbioCAgRT on-site were allowed to work with PPE pending RT-qPCR test results from the laboratory. Sensitivity of the antigen test-based strategy was 72.5% and NPV was 97%. For HCW with PanbioCAgRT-/RT-qPCR+ median Ct values were 27.8. Conclusion The PanbioCAgRTt validated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples obtained from HCW with high viral loads. The antigen-based testing strategy proposed in this study seems to be effective, safe and easy to implement in a wide range of occupational healthcare settings.","output":"Validation and implementation of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag rapid test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic hospital healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a life-threatening condition requiring life-long glucocorticoid (GC) substitution therapy, as well as stress adaptation to prevent adrenal crises.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the chest HRCT findings of 22 children who were diagnosed as COVID-19 by clinical and nucleic acid testing in Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 25 to February 5, 2020. There were 12 boys and 10 girls, aged from 2 months to 14 years old, with a median age of 4 years, and 14 patients were under 5 years old. The characteristics of lung lesions on HRCT such as distribution, shape, density and so on and whether there were hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement and pleural changes were evaluated by 2 radiologists. Results: In all of the 22 patients, the chest CT manifestations were normal in 3 patients (3/22), meanwhile the lung involvement of the lesion was found in 19 patients (19/22). Among them, 7 patients had unilateral lung involvement, and 12 patients had bilateral involvement. The HRCT manifestations were as follows. The HRCT showed the ground glass opacity (GGO) in 6 patients, including 4 cases with light opacity and 2 with typical crazy paving sign. Four patients had lung consolidation, with local fibrous stripes and patchy hyperdensity. Six patients had mixed GGO, including 1 case with right white lung. The bronchopneumonia-like changes were seen in 3 cases with scattered spot-like or mixed patchy. The lesions in the lower lobe were more serious than those in the upper lobe, and the lesions in the lateroposterior zone of the lung were more common than those in the apical and central area of the lung. No enlarged lymph nodes and pleural effusion were seen in all patients, but 1 case had thickened interlobar pleura.

With respect to the outbreak data of COVID-19 epidemics in China, we find that before the inflection point, all models fail to make a reliable prediction. The Logistic function consistently underestimates the final epidemic size, while the Gompertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Towards statistical inference methods, the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number are more accurate at the late stage of an epidemic. And the transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Compared to ODE-based SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance on studying the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success we believe could be attributed to a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.

There are a range of possible explanations for this increase, and problem gambling has been suggested as a potential risk factor. We aimed to examine the association between suicidality (suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts) and problem gambling specifically for young adults in Great Britain, where gambling has become more widely available and normalised in the past two decades. METHODS: We analysed data from the Emerging Adults Gambling Survey: a cross-sectional, online, non-probability sample survey of young adults aged 16C24 years living in Great Britain, who were selected from a YouGov online panel. Participants were eligible if they had not taken part in any other YouGov survey on gambling in the past year. We examined associations between problem gambling (defined as a score of 8 or higher on the Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI]) and suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in the year before survey completion in a series of regression models, with and without adjustment for sociodemographic factors, alcohol use, video gaming, anxiety, loneliness, and impulsivity. FINDINGS: 3549 eligible participants completed the survey between June 25 and Aug 16, 2019. 24 (370% [95% CI 256C502]) of 62 men who had attempted suicide in the past year had survey scores that were indicative of problem gambling, compared with 38 (36% [26C50]) of 1077 men who had not attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the past year. 13 (145% [85C236]) of 85 women who had attempted suicide in the past year had survey scores that were indicative of problem gambling, compared with 25 (20% [14C30]) of 1184 women who had not attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the past year. The adjusted odds ratio for attempted suicide was 90 (41C197) in men with scores that indicated problem gambling and 49 (20C120) in women with scores that indicated problem gambling, compared with participants of the same gender with PGSI scores of 0. INTERPRETATION: Problem gambling appears to be associated with suicide attempts in both young men and young women. This association persisted after adjusting for anxiety, impulsivity, life satisfaction, and other factors, which suggests that other mechanisms, such as the severity and multiplicity of harms experienced, or gambling to cope with life stressors, might underpin this relationship. Young people with problem-gambling behaviours should be considered at risk for suicidality.

Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5-39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2-37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs. However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5-14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5-16 days).

Contact transmission occurred rapidly to group B pigs whereas productive aerosol transmission failed to occur to group C pigs. Emesis was the first clinical sign noted at 3 days postinoculation (dpi) followed by mild to moderate diarrhea lasting 5 more days. Real-time PCR detected PEDV in fecal and nasal swabs, oral fluids, serum, and gastrointestinal and lymphoid tissues.

METHODS: We used data from the University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to compare the most common reasons for primary care visits before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the number of visits and the number of patients seen for each of the 25 most common diagnostic codes. The proportion of visits involving virtual care was assessed as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: UTOPIAN family physicians (N = 379) conducted 702,093 visits, involving 264,942 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2019 (pre-pandemic period), and 667,612 visits, involving 218,335 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Anxiety was the most common reason for visit, accounting for 9.2% of the total visit volume during the pandemic compared to 6.5% the year before. Diabetes and hypertension remained among the top 5 reasons for visit during the pandemic, but there were 23.7% and 26.2% fewer visits and 19.5% and 28.8% fewer individual patients accessing care for diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Preventive care visits were substantially reduced, with 89.0% fewer periodic health exams and 16.2% fewer well-baby visits. During the pandemic, virtual care became the dominant care format (77.5% virtual visits). Visits for anxiety and depression were the most common reasons for a virtual visit (90.6% virtual visits). CONCLUSION: The decrease in primary care visit volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied based on the reason for the visit, with increases in visits for anxiety and decreases for preventive care and visits for chronic diseases.

Conventional methods based on isolation of the pathogen from the food matrix and target-specific real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) are used in routine. In recent years, the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates has proven its value to collect relevant information for strain characterization as well as tracing the origin of the contamination by linking the food isolate with the patient's isolate with high resolution. However, the isolation of a bacterial pathogen from food matrices is often time-consuming and not always successful. Therefore, we aimed to improve outbreak investigation by developing a method that can be implemented in reference laboratories to characterize the pathogen in the food vehicle without its prior isolation and link it back to human cases. We tested and validated a shotgun metagenomics approach by spiking food pathogens in specific food matrices using the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) as a case study. Different DNA extraction kits and enrichment procedures were investigated to obtain the most practical workflow. We demonstrated the feasibility of shotgun metagenomics to obtain the same information as in ISO/TS 13136:2012 and WGS of the isolate in parallel by inferring the genome of the contaminant and characterizing it in a shorter timeframe. This was achieved in food samples containing different E. coli strains, including a combination of different STEC strains. For the first time, we also managed to link individual strains from a food product to isolates from human cases, demonstrating the power of shotgun metagenomics for rapid outbreak investigation and source tracking.","output":"A Practical Method to Implement Strain-Level Metagenomics-Based Foodborne Outbreak Investigation and Source Tracking in Routine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, social workers moved many of their activities into virtual spaces. One of the key characteristics of professional practice in social work is the need for permanent contact with users. The social distancing measures established by the government hindered the normal continuity of activities, in this case the ICT tools provided the necessary infrastructure for the development of various professional processes related to the profession. Particularly noteworthy is the educational practice, which was reinforced in virtual contexts with the advent of quarantine regulations. In the case of social workers, one of the strategies for the continuity of their professional action was precisely to expand training activities, making use of social networks and linking various actors in the process. This text presents some experiences of social workers related to virtuality in the framework of the pandemic, it is evident a reconsideration of the educational processes as the basis of the exercise of social work, although many of these activities initially had a focus that was not necessarily educational but through the strengthening of training spaces managed to facilitate the development of professional actions of the discipline. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Educational Experiences in Distance Social Work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The novel coronavirus variant - severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes clinically (novel coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) have placed medical science into a frenzy due to the significant morbidity and mortality, as well as the myriad of clinical complications developing as a direct result of infection. The most notable and one of the most severe changes in COVID-19 develops in the lungs. Materials and methods All cases of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR)-proved COVID-19 subjected to autopsy were withdrawn from the central histopathology archive of a single tertiary medical institution - St. Marina University Hospital - Varna, Varna, Bulgaria. Pulmonary gross and histopathology changes observed on light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin as well with other histochemical and immunohistochemical stains were compared with the time from patient-reported symptom onset to expiration, to compare the extent and type of changes based on disease duration. Results A total of 27 autopsy cases fit the established criteria. All cases clinically manifested with severe COVID-19. From the selected 27 cases, n=14 were male and n=13 were female. The mean age in the cohort was 67.44 years (range 18-91 years), with the mean age for males being 68.29 (range 38-80 years) and the mean age for females being 66.54 (range 18-91 years). Gross changes in patients who expired in the first 10 days after disease onset showed a significantly increased mean weight - 1050g, compared to a relatively lower weight in patients expiring more than 10 days after symptom onset - 940g. Histopathology changes were identified as intermittent (developing independent from symptom onset and persisting) - diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes - acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis with vascular degeneration and fibrin thrombi; early (developing within the first week, but persisting) - type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, alveolar cell multinucleation and scant interstitial mononuclear inflammation; intermediate (developing within the late first and second weeks) - Clara cell hyperplasia and late (developing after the second week of symptom onset) - respiratory tract and alveolar squamous cell metaplasia and fibrosis. Conclusion COVID-19-associated pulmonary pathology, both gross and histopathology, show a time-related dynamic with persistent early and a myriad of later developing dynamic changes in patients with severe disease. These changes underline both the severity of the condition, as well as the mechanisms and the probability of long-lasting severe complications in patients with post-COVID syndrome.","output":"Temporal Patterns of COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Pathology: An Autopsy Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The impact of suture materials on the development of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy remains unclear. Thus, their choice among pancreatic surgeons is still mostly experience-based. Aim of the present study is to assess what is the best suture material to be used for pancreaticojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The force needed to reach the breaking point of five widely used suture materials (polypropylene, polyester, polydioxanone, silk, and polyglactin 910) has been determined through a digital precision dynamometer at baseline and after 5 and 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice, bile, or a mixture of both. RESULTS Regardless of the condition, polyglactin 910 has retained only 10% of its baseline force. Silk has maintained almost 90% of its initial force showing a very low baseline value of force. In pancreatic juice, polypropylene has lost less force compared to polyester (0.25 vs. 0.93 N; p = 0.03) and polydioxanone (0.25 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.04). Polyester and polydioxanone have showed similar values of force. However, polydioxanone has lost a significant amount of force in pancreatic juice when compared to polyester (0.93 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.03). Polyester has showed the highest value of force needed to reach the breaking point after 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice. CONCLUSIONS After incubation in pancreaticobiliary secretions, polyglactin 910 loses almost all its force. Polypropylene preserves its characteristic, but polydioxanone and polyester show absolute higher breaking points, with polyester retaining the highest value of force needed to reach its breaking point after incubation in pancreatic juice.","output":"Polyester Preserves the Highest Breaking Point After Prolonged Incubation in Pancreatic Juice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus (EBOV) infections cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans, resulting in up to 90% mortality.

Mice and guinea pigs were first immunized with 2  10(4) or 2  10(5) plaque forming units (PFU) of VSVG/EBOVGP, respectively. Challenge of mice with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination provided complete protection, and 80% (12 of 15 survivors) protection at 12 months after vaccination. Challenge of guinea pigs with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GA-EBOV) at 7, 12 and 18 months after vaccination resulted in 83% (5 of 6 survivors) at 7 months after vaccination, and 100% survival at 12 and 18 months after vaccination. No weight loss or clinical signs were observed in the surviving animals. Antibody responses were analyzed using sera from individual rodents.

Methods: : Data was extracted from the World Banks website. A descriptive analysis was conducted as well as modelling of COVID-19 spread from day one through day 120 in Nigeria and seven other countries. Model fitting was conducted using linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression methods (=0.05). Results: : The COVID-19 spread pattern in Nigeria was similar to the patterns in Egypt, Ghana and Cameroun. The daily death distribution in Nigeria was similar to those of six out of the seven countries considered. There was an increasing trend in the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. During the lockdown, the growth rate in Nigeria was 5.85 (R 2 =0.728, p<0.001);however, it was 8.42 (R 2 =0.625, p<0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed.

Additionally, it remains unclear whether the D-dimer measurement is useful for VTE risk stratification among COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to offer benchmark data on the incidence of VTE and to examine the difference in D-dimer levels among anticoagulated COVID-19 patients with and without VTE incident. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed from inception to May 2020 was performed for original studies that reported the frequency of VTE and death among COVID-19 patients who received thromboprophylaxis on hospitalization. The endpoints included VTE (a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), PE, DVT, and mortality. Results: A total of 11 cohort studies were included. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 23.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 16.2% to 33.7%; I(2) = 93%) developed VTE despite anticoagulation.

METHODS: The release of sTLR2 and sTLR4 was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia (n = 11, 2 ng/kg LPS), and in plasma of 394 patients with infections (infectious mononucleosis, measles, respiratory tract infections, bacterial sepsis and candidemia) or non-infectious inflammation (Crohns disease, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes and pancreatitis). Using C-statistics, the value of sTLR2 and sTLR4 levels for discrimination between infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as well as between viral and bacterial infections was analyzed. RESULTS: In-vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells released sTLR2 and sTLR4 by exposure to microbial ligands.

It is argued that epistemological vaccines, despite having an enormous value in fighting against post-truth, are insufficient to transform this social condition and its implications for science and technology.

This study compared five different synthetic and biologic meshes in terms of adhesion formation, shrinkage, incorporation, and histologic characteristics after a period of 30 and 90 days. METHODS In 85 rats, a mesh was positioned intraperitoneally in direct contact with the viscera. Five different meshes were implanted: Prolene (polypropylene), Parietex composite (collagen-coated polyester), Strattice (porcine dermis, non-cross-linked), Surgisis (porcine small intestine submucosa, non-cross-linked), and Permacol (porcine dermis, cross-linked). The meshes were tested in terms of adhesion formation, shrinkage, and incorporation after a period of 30 and 90 days. Additionally, collagen formation after 90 days was determined. RESULTS Significantly less adhesion formation was observed with Parietex composite (5 %; interquartile range [IQR], 2-5 %) and Strattice (5 %; IQR, 4-10 %) in the long term. In contrast, organs were attached to Permacol with four of seven meshes (57 %), and adhesion coverage of Surgisis mesh was present in 66 % (IQR, 0-100 %) of the cases. After 90 days, the best incorporation was seen with the Parietex composite mesh (79 %; IQR, 61-83 %). After 90 days, major alterations in adhesion formation were seen compared with 30 days. Histologically, Strattice and Parietex composite showed a new mesothelial layer on the visceral side of the mesh. Microscopic degradation and new collagen formation were seen in the Surgisis group. CONCLUSIONS Parietex composite mesh demonstrated the best long-term results compared with all the other meshes. The biologic non-cross-linked mesh, Strattice, showed little adhesion formation and moderate shrinkage but poor incorporation.

We also demonstrate 9x speedup on the 64 core AMD EPYC 7742 multicore platform. By using OpenACC for both the CPUs and the GPUs, we maintain a single source code base, thus creating a portable yet performant solution. With the simulator's most significant computational bottleneck significantly reduced, we can continue cancer simulations over much longer times.","output":"OpenACC Acceleration of an Agent-Based Biological Simulation Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A high population level of vaccination is required to control the COVID-19 pandemic, but not all Canadians are convinced of the value and safety of vaccination. Understanding more about these individuals can aid in developing strategies to increase their acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. The objectives of this study were to describe COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and refusal rates and associated factors in Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS: This is a cross-sequential study that consisted of pooled responses from weighted samples of 9,252 Saskatchewan adults (18 years) across nine rounds of data collection between May 4, 2020 and April 3, 2021. The outcome variable was vaccine intention: vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal. The independent variables were layered into socio-demographic factors, risk of exposure to coronavirus, mitigating behaviours, and perceptions of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and a classification and regression tree. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the respondents indicated that they had been or were willing to be vaccinated, 13% had not yet decided, and the remaining 11% said they would not be vaccinated. Factors that increased the likelihood of vaccine refusal and hesitancy were lower education level, financial instability, Indigenous status, and not being concerned about spreading the coronavirus. Perceiving COVID-19 to be more of a threat to ones community and believing that one had a higher risk of illness or death from COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of both vaccine refusal and hesitancy. Women and newcomers to Canada were more likely to be unsure about getting vaccinated. Respondents who did not plan to be vaccinated were less likely to wear face masks and practice physical distancing. CONCLUSION: While many Canadians have voluntarily and eagerly become vaccinated already, reaching sufficient coverage of the population is likely to require targeted efforts to convince those who are resistant or unsure. Identifying and overcoming any barriers to vaccination that exist within the socio-demographic groups we found were least likely to be vaccinated is a crucial component.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal and associated factors in an adult population in Saskatchewan, Canada: Evidence from predictive modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent development of wireless communications has prompted many diversified applications in both industrial and medical sectors. Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Its performance depends on networking parameters, such as baud rates, transmission power, data encryption, hopping, deployment environment, and transmission distances. For optimized network deployment, an extensive performance analysis is necessary. This would facilitate a clear understanding of the trade-offs of the network performance metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network life, link quality, latency, and throughput. This work presents an extensive performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contributions of this work include (i) evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee, considering packet delivery ratio and network lifetime; (ii) formulating an algorithm to find the network lifetime from the measured current consumption of packet transmission; and (iii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of the multi-hop communication and data encryption with latency, transmission range, and throughput.","output":"Comprehensive Performance Analysis of Zigbee Communication: An Experimental Approach with XBee S2C Module"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a complex disease, and many difficulties are faced today especially in the proper choice of pharmacological treatments.

Viral DMVs are morphologically analogous to DMVs formed during autophagy, and although the proteins required for DMV formation are extensively studied, the lipids driving their biogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that production of the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) 1 and 2 in the ER is important for DMV biogenesis in viral replication and autophagy. Using DMVs in HCV-replicating cells as model, we found that AGPATs are recruited to and critically contribute to HCV replication and DMV formation. AGPAT1/2 double knockout also impaired SARS-CoV-2 replication and the formation of autophagosome-like structures. By using correlative light and electron microscopy, we observed the relocalization of AGPAT proteins to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 induced DMVs. In addition, an intracellular PA sensor accumulated at viral DMV formation sites, consistent with elevated levels of PA in fractions of purified DMVs analyzed by lipidomics. Apart from AGPATs, PA is generated by alternative pathways via phosphotidylcholine (PC) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Pharmacological inhibition of these synthesis pathways also impaired HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. These data identify PA as an important lipid used for replication organelle formation by HCV and SARS-CoV-2, two phylogenetically disparate viruses causing very different diseases, i.e. chronic liver disease and COVID-19, respectively. In addition, our data argue that host-targeting therapy aiming at PA synthesis pathways might be suitable to attenuate replication of these viruses.

One dose of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is efficacious in the general population, but responses in patients receiving hemodialysis are uncertain. METHODS: We obtained serial plasma from patients receiving hemodialysis and health care worker controls before and after vaccination with 1 dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as well as convalescent plasma from patients receiving hemodialysis who survived COVID-19. We measured anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and stratified groups by evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our study included 154 patients receiving hemodialysis (135 without and 19 with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), 40 controls (20 without and 20 with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) and convalescent plasma from 16 patients. Among those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-RBD IgG was undetectable at 4 weeks in 75 of 131 (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47% to 65%) patients receiving hemodialysis, compared with 1 of 20 (5%, 95% CI 1% to 23%) controls (p < 0.001). No patient with nondetectable levels at 4 weeks developed anti-RBD IgG by 8 weeks. Results were similar in non-immunosuppressed and younger individuals. Three patients receiving hemodialysis developed severe COVID-19 after vaccination. Among those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, median anti-RBD IgG levels at 8 weeks in patients receiving hemodialysis were similar to controls at 3 weeks (p = 0.3) and to convalescent plasma (p = 0.8). INTERPRETATION: A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine failed to elicit a humoral immune response in most patients receiving hemodialysis without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after prolonged observation. In those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, the antibody response was delayed. We advise that patients receiving hemodialysis be prioritized for a second BNT162b2 dose at the recommended 3-week interval.","output":"Short-term antibody response after 1 dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in patients receiving hemodialysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gold as a tradable financial asset has acquired the reputation of a safe haven from market turbulence. The objective of this study is to investigate empirically the relationship between gold prices and implied volatility in the futures markets of gold, re-examine the leverage hypothesis and attempt to make inferences about golds safe haven properties. In doing so, it utilizes the recently developed econometric tool of non-parametric quantile regressions. This is the first work to apply the flexible non-parametric quantile regressions on the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of gold. The data used are daily returns of options of gold shares and implied volatility changes from June of 2008 to December of 2018. The empirical findings indicate that, for the total sample period as well as for almost all of the five sub-periods examined, changes in the implied volatility of gold are insensitive, and not statistically significant, to changes in the price returns of gold. The leverage hypothesis holds for a wide range in the third sub-period. Accordingly, investors in other ETFs (currency or oil) may choose to use gold as shelter during (extreme) economic downturns.

RESULTS: The temperature, population size, and median age are positively associated with the spreading rate of COVID-19. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline in countries with better health care facilities. Also, an empirical model was presented to estimate the number of cases within a country using the external parameters.

We augmented the model with age structure-related variables and comorbidity via non-communicable diseases for 117 countries of the world for September 23, 2021, on a cross-section basis. A broad-based global quantitative study incorporating these two prominent channels with regional variation was unavailable in the existing literature. Old age and comorbidity were identified as two prime determinants of COVID-19 mortality. The path model showed that after controlling for these factors, one SD increase in the proportion of persons above 65, above 70, or of median age raised COVID-19 mortality by more than 0.12 SDs for 117 countries. The regional intensity of death is alarmingly high in South America, Europe, and North America compared with Oceania. After controlling for regions, the figure was raised to 0.213, which was even higher. For old age, the incremental coefficient was the highest for South America (0.564), and Europe (0.314), which were substantially higher than in Oceania. The comorbidity channel via non-communicable diseases illustrated that one SD increase in non-communicable disease intensity increased COVID-19 mortality by 0.132 for the whole sample. The regional figure for the non-communicable disease was 0.594 for South America and 0.358 for Europe compared with the benchmark region Oceania. The results were statistically significant at a 10% level of significance or above. This suggested that we should prioritize vaccinations for the elderly and people with comorbidity via non-communicable diseases like heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes.

BACKGROUND: severe and numerous restrictions were taken in Spain during lockdown. Significant consequences from the physical and emotional point of view were described. Pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome (TKS) is complex but the ocurrence of acute emotional or physical triggers is found in almost 50% of cases. METHODS AND PURPOSE: Retrospective study to compare patients treated by urgent coronary angiography during the period of lockdown in Spain (03/15/2020 to 05/31/2020) and patients in the same period of the previous year (2019). The aim is to present our experience comparing the two periods and to evaluate the incidence of TKS during lockdown. RESULTS: We included 73 patients from the pre-COVID period (2019) and 67 patients from the lockdown period. We found 4 cases of TKS during lockdown (6%) versus 0 cases in pre-COVID period. Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. All cases of TKS were female. The median age was 66 years +/- 12. In 2 cases there was an emotional trigger (stress or anxiety) but in the other 2 cases the trigger was unknown. All patients with TKS presented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three cases showed typical wall motion abnormalities (apical and mid wall segments) and one case had circumferential hypokinesia of basal segments (consistent with reversed TKS). 3 cases were negative for COVID-19 PCR test and 1 unsuspected case was not tested for COVID-19. One patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest died while receiving mechanical ventilation.

Italy, in the context of the research, has been severely affected. The economic crisis has mainly affected women. In this scenario, entrepreneurial perceived success (objective and subjective) is influenced by increasingly burdensome job demands that entrepreneurs have to face up. Using the job demand-resources model, the study aims to broaden the knowledge of the determinants of entrepreneurial perceived success in the current emergency moment. In particular, as regards of the demands, alongside the specific entrepreneurial demands (time demands, uncertainty and risk, and responsibility), we also decided to include the negative interface familyCwork in both directions from-family-to-work (NEGWIF) and from-work-to-family (NEGFIW). Regarding the resources, we considered entrepreneurial self-efficacy (researching, planning, marshaling, implementing people, and implementing financial), proactive and elaborate social strategies (SS), and both directions of the positive interface: from-family-to-work (POSWIF) and from-work-to-family (POSFIW). All participants are women entrepreneurs (N = 137) who have completed a self-report questionnaire. We explored the associations between demands, resources, and the dimensions of success through hierarchical regressions. As for the demands, time demands, uncertainty and risk, NEGWIF, and NEGFIW negatively influenced the perceived entrepreneurial success.

As restrictions are eased, there is significant interest in understanding the relative risk of spreading COVID-19 posed by unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals. MethodsA stochastic branching process model is used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 for outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals. The likelihood of infecting or getting infected with COVID-19 is calculated based on vaccination status. ResultsA vaccinated traveler infected with COVID-19 is 9x less likely to seed an outbreak than an unvaccinated traveler infected with COVID-19. For a vaccination rate of 50%, unvaccinated individuals are responsible for 87% of all infections whereas 3% of infections are from vaccinated to vaccinated. When normalized by population, a vaccinated individual is 6.8x more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated individual than by a vaccinated individual. For a total population vaccination rate of 78.7%, which is equivalent to the 90% vaccination target for the eligible population (over 12 years old), this means that vaccinated individuals are 1.9x more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated individual than by a vaccinated, even though there are 3.7x more vaccinated individuals in the population. ConclusionsThis work demonstrates that most new infections are caused by unvaccinated individuals.

This study aims to explore pregnant women's experiences, decision-making processes and perceptions towards maternal vaccination and maternal vaccine trials in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with 258 pregnant women identified through local research panels and snowballing. Topic guides translated in local languages were designed to explore women's awareness and perceptions of maternal vaccination, and willingness to participate in vaccine trials during pregnancy. A thematic analysis was conducted. Pregnant women were found to have low awareness about maternal vaccination, with many reporting not having received a recommendation to vaccinate from their doctors. Strong trust in health professionals indicate that strengthened recommendations could improve vaccination uptake. Vaccination decision-making in pregnancy was described in the context of a highly emotional period, generating anxiety and fears around the safety of vaccines. Pregnancy was also discussed as a period during which women develop nurturing and protective identities. However, depending on the information they received as well as influences from experts, families and peers, women either perceived vaccination as a threat to their babies' safety or as a means to protect them. Attitudes towards maternal vaccine trials were less ambiguous, with most pregnant women strongly rejecting the notion of taking part in trials. While strategies to improve pregnant women's awareness and perceptions of maternal vaccination are needed, it is equally important to understand why healthcare professionals may not be recommending vaccination.

However, IgM, NS1, and RT-PCR analyses showed negative results. Interestingly, regarding seropositivity of NS1 and DENV IgG from healthy individuals (pre COVID-19 infection), two samples were positive DENV IgG, while one of them was positive NS1. This suggested that in the dengue-endemic area, many people have already experienced dengue and have immunity against dengue virus.

The aim of this survey was to explore radiologists opinions concerning their role and identity in 2020. METHODS: The survey included 124 questions on training, daily work, interaction with colleagues and patients, involvement in teaching, research and management and task delegation. An initial draft was amended following responses from the Presidents of the 48 ESRs national institutional member societies. The final on-line survey was available to individual ESR full members between January and March 2020. 1344 responses from radiologists in 49 European countries were obtained. FINDINGS: 80% (1049/1317) of radiologists considered a period of non-radiology clinical training mandatory and 92% (1192/1291) felt that sub-specialty expertise was important and improved the visibility of radiologists. 76% (961/1262) of radiologists regularly communicate directly with patients. Only 25% (314/1238) had undergone formal communications training although 82% (1020/1238) felt that this would be beneficial. Radiologists highly value their positive interaction with colleagues, including within multi-disciplinary team meetings, despite limited resources. Difficulties identified included high workload, especially the need to cover general work in parallel with the need to offer subspecialty expertise. 66% (837/1262) felt that lack of visibility to patients is a risk to radiology and professional visibility could be improved by radiology-led research and teaching.

METHODS: 32 patients recovered from COVID-19 and age- and gender-matched 36 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. Ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, macular and peripapiller retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the outer retinal hyperreflective bands including external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) were examined with SD-OCT. The differences of each retinal layers thickness among subgroup analysis of ocular pain and headache were also compared. RESULTS: Macular RNFL of inner and outer nasal and outer inferior quadrants were thinner in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy control group (p = 0.046, p = 0.014 and p = 0.016, respectively). Thinning in outer superior quadrant of GCIPL and INL quadrants were detected in patients with headache (p = 0.026 and p = 0.01). Superonasal and inferotemporal sectors of pRNFL were thinner in patients with ocular pain compared to patients without ocular pain (p = 0.024 and p = 0.015). Integrity of EZ, ELM and IZ was evaluated as continuous line and protected on each OCT scans. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the inner and outer retinal layers, with subclinical localized alterations, particularly in patients with headache and ocular pain symptoms during COVID-19 period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and sixteen COVID-19 patients (246 non-severe and 70 severe) were retrospectively collected from two institutions and allocated to training, validation, and testing cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT images. Radiomics signature was constructed based on reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation. Logistic regression modeling was employed to build different models based on quantitative CT features, radiomics signature, clinical factors, and/or the former combined features. Nomogram performance for severe COVID-19 prediction was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Sixteen selected features were used to build the radiomics signature. The CT-based radiomics model showed good calibration and discrimination in the training cohort (AUC, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.843-0.942), the validation cohort (AUC, 0.878; 95% CI, 0.796-0.958), and the testing cohort (AUC, 0.842; 95% CI, 0.761-0.922). The CT-based radiomics model showed better discrimination capability (all p < 0.05) compared with the clinical factors joint quantitative CT model (AUC, 0.781; 95% CI, 0.708-0.843) in the training cohort, the validation cohort (AUC, 0.814; 95% CI, 0.703-0.897), and the testing cohort (AUC, 0.696; 95% CI, 0.581-0.796).

The role of a country's governance in slowing the spread of COVID-19 has not yet been well investigated. Objective: This study aims to investigate the association between governance and the trend of COVID-19 incidence in countries with the highest prevalence. We hypothesized that countries with better governance are more likely to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 than countries with worse governance. Methods: We analyzed 62 most prevalent countries with at least 10,000 accumulative confirmed cases from January 22 to June 15, 2020. Countries were further grouped into three different levels of governance (25 better governance, 24 fair governance, and 13 worse governance), identified outbreak and mitigation periods using the joinpoint regression model, and compared the number of days and average daily percent change in incidence in two periods by governance level using the one-way analysis of variance. Findings: The average outbreak period in the 62 countries lasted 84.0 days. Sixty percent of countries (N = 37) had experienced outbreak periods, followed by a mitigation period. In contrast, the rest forty percent of countries (N = 25) still had a rising trend. In the outbreak period, better governance countries had a more rapid increase but a shorter outbreak period (71.2 days) than countries with fair (93.5 days) and worse (90.8 days) governance. Most countries with better governance (84.0%) revealed a declining trend in COVID-19 incidence, while such a trend was less than half of fair and worse governance countries (38.5%-41.7%). Conclusions: Countries with better governance are more resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. While the mitigation of COVID-19 is observed in most better governance countries, the incidence of COVID-19 is still surging in most fair and worse governance countries, and the possibility of a recurring epidemic of COVID-19 in countries cannot be ignored.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak, Mitigation, and Governance in High Prevalent Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe threat to human health worldwide.

Early detection of COVID-19 patients is an important issue for treating and controlling the disease from spreading. In this paper, a new strategy for detecting COVID-19 infected patients will be introduced, which is called Distance Biased Na?ve Bayes (DBNB). The novelty of DBNB as a proposed classification strategy is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new feature selection technique called Advanced Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) which elects the most informative and significant features for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. APSO is a hybrid method based on both filter and wrapper methods to provide accurate and significant features for the next classification phase. The considered features are extracted from Laboratory findings for different cases of people, some of whom are COVID-19 infected while some are not. APSO consists of two sequential feature selection stages, namely; Initial Selection Stage (IS(2)) and Final Selection Stage (FS(2)). IS(2) uses filter technique to quickly select the most important features for diagnosing COVID-19 patients while removing the redundant and ineffective ones. This behavior minimizes the computational cost in FS(2), which is the next stage of APSO. FS(2) uses Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) as a wrapper method for accurate feature selection. The second contribution of this paper is a new classification model, which combines evidence from statistical and distance based classification models. The proposed classification technique avoids the problems of the traditional NB and consists of two modules; Weighted Na?ve Bayes Module (WNBM) and Distance Reinforcement Module (DRM). The proposed DBNB tries to accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on the most effective features selected by APSO. DBNB has been compared with recent COVID-19 diagnose strategies. Experimental results have shown that DBNB outperforms recent COVID-19 diagnose strategies as it introduce the maximum accuracy with the minimum time penalty.","output":"Accurate Detection of COVID-19 Patients Based on Distance Biased Na?ve Bayes (DBNB) Classification Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a year of challenges from the novel coronavirus, the new Queensland Human Rights Act was applied in unexpected ways Its new complaints process was particularly tested by hotel quarantine restrictions Nonetheless, geographic and demographic differences between Queensland and other human rights jurisdictions are also emerging as especially relevant to how human rights protection will be applied in the state, particularly a new Australian right to health and the cultural rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples","output":"A novel year for human rights in Queensland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The year 2020 has been challenging for many, particularly for young adults who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","output":"Using Multimodal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of College Student Well-being in 2020: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many scholars have conducted in-depth research on the theme of land use change and food security, and formed fruitful research results, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis and comprehensive evaluation of research achievements.

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possibly non-linear influences remain unknown. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th, were analyzed. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate and exploit the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. Results A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile ranges [IQR] 38 - 55, range 16 - 60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of ASS, CRP and LDH, and decreased lymphocyte counts are influential on disease severity independent of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p=0.039) are particularly associated with the risk for the development of severity specifically in young patients, where no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. Conclusion In young patients with COVID-19, the levels of complement C3 correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","output":"Complement C3 identified as a unique Risk Factor for Disease Severity among Young COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We report a patient who presented with respiratory failure, chest pain, and fever.

Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) is recommended by WHO for implementation in high-burden countries, but there is little evidence about its ability to protect against clinical typhoid in such settings. METHODS: We did a participant-masked and observer-masked cluster-randomised trial preceded by a safety pilot phase in an urban endemic setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 clusters, each with approximately 1350 residents, were randomly assigned (1:1) to either Vi-TT or SA 14-14-2 Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine. Children aged 9 months to less than 16 years were invited via parent or guardian to receive a single, parenteral dose of vaccine according to their cluster of residence. The study population was followed for an average of 171 months. Total and overall protection by Vi-TT against blood culture-confirmed typhoid were the primary endpoints assessed in the intention-to-treat population of vaccinees or all residents in the clusters. A subset of approximately 4800 participants was assessed with active surveillance for adverse events. The trial is registered at www.isrctn.com, ISRCTN11643110. FINDINGS: 41 344 children were vaccinated in AprilCMay, 2018, with another 20 412 children vaccinated at catch-up vaccination campaigns between September and December, 2018, and April and May, 2019.

This study was done to evaluate the preventive practices being followed by health care workers and identify reasons for suboptimal compliance. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done in HCWs belonging to various occupational roles and socio-cultural backgrounds across India through online platforms and telephonic interviews from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. A scientifically designed and pre-validated questionnaire with good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85) was used. RESULTS: The responses of 956 participants were analysed. Various suboptimal practices like touching outer surface of masks, lack of social distancing in cafeteria and duty rooms, inability to wash hands for adequate duration and properly follow steps of hand hygiene, inability to don and doff PPE properly, carrying PPE to duty rooms before completely doffing, use of personal mobile phones during duty and improper sleep were identified. Lack of knowledge, long duty hours, shortage of PPE, high patient workload, and casual attitude regarding own safety were identified as important barriers. Resident doctors and paramedical staff in the age group 18-30 years reported lower adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal compliance in preventive practices like handling PPE, distancing in cafeteria/duty rooms and hand hygiene is not uncommon in HCWs. Certain barriers are identified which should be addressed to ensure adequate safety of HCWs against COVID-19.","output":"Are health care workers following preventive practices in the COVID-19 pandemic properly? - A cross-sectional survey from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The psychological distress of people living with diabetes is increased and associated with poorer glycemic outcomes and self-care. We aimed to examine the frequency of depression, anxiety, and diabetes-related distress (DRD) of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in primary care (PC) and their comparative associations with clinical, self-care, and socio-demographic characteristics, testing for possible different roles on glycemic control and self-care. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 182 adults with a T2D diagnosis of at least six months, recruited between August 2019-March 2020 and May-October 2020, from an urban PC unit. Participants were screened for symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)), and DRD (Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)). Clinical, self-care, and socio-demographic parameters were recorded. RESULTS: The frequency of clinically significant symptoms of depression was 16.6%, (PHQ-9 score ?10), anxiety 17.7% (GAD-7 score ?10), and DRD 22.6% (DDS score ?2). All PHQ-9, GAD-7, and DDS scores intercorrelated, and higher scores were found to be associated with female gender, lower income, and prior diagnosis of depression. Higher PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were found to be associated with lower education, more hypoglycemia episodes, more blood glucose self-tests and antidepressant or benzodiazepine use. The retired/housewives scored significantly lower in GAD-7 and DDS compared to the unemployed participants. Higher DDS scores were associated with higher glycated hemoglobin, higher fasting plasma glucose, and insulin use. It was also noted that higher PHQ-9 scores were associated with lower uric acid levels and were significantly higher in the sedentary lifestyle group. CONCLUSION: DRD was associated with poorer glycemic outcomes while depressive symptoms were associated with lower physical activity perhaps sharing different roles for glycemic control and self-care.

Despite exposure to highly infectious batches of anti-D, almost 600 of the HCV-exposed women have never shown any evidence of infection (remaining negative for both viral RNA and anti-HCV antibodies).

Several compounds, including silica dust, have been linked with systemic autoimmunity and systemic autoimmune diseases, based on epidemiological evidence. For asbestos, a strong link with systemic autoimmune diseases does not yet exist, however, several studies have documented features of autoimmunity following asbestos exposure. Even so, human studies are limited in their ability to identify and examine isolated exposures, making it difficult to demonstrate causation or to assess pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, this systematic review examines the existing animal evidence regarding autoimmunity and exposure to silicates (silica and asbestos). METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies examining systemic autoimmune disease-related outcomes after silicate exposure in rodents. Literature databases were searched up to September 2021 for studies written in English and where the full text was available. Search strings were established based on a PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) format. After title, abstract, and full-text screening, thirty-four studies were identified for further analysis. Quality assessment through ToxR tool and qualitative analysis of the results was performed. RESULTS: Although there was significant heterogeneity in the included studies in terms of exposure protocol and genetic background of the rodent models used, it was noted that both genetic background and exposure to silicates [(crystalline) silica and asbestos] are highly relevant to the development of (sub-) clinical systemic autoimmune disease. CONCLUSION: Parallels were observed between the findings from the animal (this review) and human (epidemiological) studies, arguing that experimental animal models are valuable tools for examining exacerbation or development of autoimmune disease after silicate exposure. However, genetic background and synergism between exposures should be considered in future studies.

Because of its authoritarian political system and state-owned media system, how Chinese individuals engaged in protective actions against COVID-19 might be different compared to other countries. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine how the source of information about COVID-19, Chinese individuals risk perception of COVID-19 (ie, perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), and their efficacy appraisal in controlling COVID-19 (ie, response efficacy and self-efficacy) affected their engagement in protective actions. Additionally, this study aims to investigate whether there is any difference in these relationships throughout the duration of this pandemic. METHODS: A six-wave repeated cross-sectional survey (N=1942) was conducted in six major cities in China between February 7 and April 23, 2020. Participants reliance on expert versus inexpert sources for information about COVID-19, their perceived severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19, their response efficacy and self-efficacy, and their engagement in protective actions (staying at home, wearing a face mask, and washing hands) were measured. Demographic variables (sex, age, income, education, and city of residence), knowledge of COVID-19, and self-rated health condition were controlled. RESULTS: Reliance on expert sources did not become the major factor that motivated these actions until wave 3, and the negative effect of inexpert sources on these actions was limited to wave 2. Perceived severity encouraged some protective behaviors but its effect varied depending on the specific behavior. In addition, perceived severity exhibited a stronger effect on these behaviors compared to perceived susceptibility. The positive effect of response efficacy was only significant at waves 1 and 2, and limited to certain behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese individuals engagement in protective behaviors might not entirely be their autonomous decision but a result of compliance with executive orders. After the early outbreak, expert sources started to facilitate protective behaviors, suggesting that it might take time to develop trust in these sources. The facilitating effect of perceived severity lasted throughout the duration of the pandemic, but that of response efficacy was limited to the early stage.","output":"Information Sources, Risk Perception, and Efficacy Appraisals Prediction of Engagement in Protective Behaviors Against COVID-19 in China: Repeated Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 67-year-old female presented with upper respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19.

INTERVENTIONS: Sheep were instrumented with pulmonary and renal artery flow-probes, and laser-Doppler and oxygen-sensing probes in the kidney. Conscious sheep received an infusion of live Escherichia coli for 31 hours. At 23.5 hours of sepsis, sheep received fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg, Hartmann solution) and were randomized to IV sodium ascorbate (0.5 g/kg over 0.5 hr + 0.5 g/kg/hr for 6.5 hr; n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5). Norepinephrine was titrated to restore mean arterial pressure to baseline values (~80 mm Hg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sepsis-induced fever (41.4  0.2C; mean  SE), tachycardia (141  2 beats/min), and a marked deterioration in clinical condition in all cases. Mean arterial pressure (86  1 to 67  2 mm Hg), arterial PO2 (102.1  3.3 to 80.5  3.4 mm Hg), and renal medullary tissue PO2 (41  5 to 24  2 mm Hg) decreased, and plasma creatinine doubled (71  2 to 144  15 mol/L) (all p < 0.01). Direct observation indicated that in all animals, sodium ascorbate dramatically improved the clinical state, from malaise and lethargy to a responsive, alert state within 3 hours. Body temperature (39.3  0.3C), heart rate (99.7  3 beats/min), and plasma creatinine (32.6  5.8 mol/L) all decreased. Arterial (96.5  2.5 mm Hg) and renal medullary PO2 (48  5 mm Hg) increased.

The emerging link between vascular risk factors (VRF) and longitudinal decline in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within functional brain networks needs replication and further research in independent cohorts. Method: We examined 95 non-demented older adults using the IMAP+ cohort (Caen, France). VRF were assessed at baseline through systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body-mass-index, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Brain pathological burden was measured using white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, derived from FLAIR images, and cortical ?-Amyloid (A?) deposition, derived from florbetapir-PET imaging. RSFC was estimated from functional MRI scans within canonical brain networks at baseline and up to 3 years of follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated the independent predictive value of VRF on longitudinal changes in network-specific and global RSFC as well as a potential association between these RSFC changes and cognitive decline. Results: We replicate that RSFC increased over time in global RSFC and in the default-mode, salience/ventral-attention and fronto-parietal networks. In contrast, higher diastolic blood pressure levels were independently associated with a decrease of RSFC over time in the default-mode, salience/ventral-attention, and fronto-parietal networks. Moreover, higher HbA1c levels were independently associated with a reduction of the observed RSFC increase over time in the salience/ventral-attention network. Both of these associations were independent of brain pathology related to A? load and WMH volumes. The VRF-related changes in RSFC over time were not significantly associated with longitudinal changes in cognitive performance. Conclusion: Our longitudinal findings corroborate that VRF promote RSFC alterations over time within higher-order brain networks, irrespective of pathological brain burden.

Despite these success stories, several challenges remain in RNA delivery, including what is known as \\"endosomal escape.\\" Reaching the cytosol is mandatory for unleashing the therapeutic activity of RNA molecules, as their accumulation in other intracellular compartments would simply result in efficacy loss.

Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier to investigate ?-helical AMPs and the interrelated nature of their functional commonality and sequence homology. SVM is used to search the undiscovered peptide sequence space and identify Pareto-optimal candidates that simultaneously maximize the distance  from the SVM hyperplane (thus maximize its \\"antimicrobialness\\") and its ?-helicity, but minimize mutational distance to known AMPs. By calibrating SVM machine learning results with killing assays and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we find that the SVM metric  correlates not with a peptide's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but rather its ability to generate negative Gaussian membrane curvature. This surprising result provides a topological basis for membrane activity common to AMPs. Moreover, we highlight an important distinction between the maximal recognizability of a sequence to a trained AMP classifier (its ability to generate membrane curvature) and its maximal antimicrobial efficacy. As mutational distances are increased from known AMPs, we find AMP-like sequences that are increasingly difficult for nature to discover via simple mutation. Using the sequence map as a discovery tool, we find a unexpectedly diverse taxonomy of sequences that are just as membrane-active as known AMPs, but with a broad range of primary functions distinct from AMP functions, including endogenous neuropeptides, viral fusion proteins, topogenic peptides, and amyloids.

Higher rates of violations and errors were associated with increased crash likelihood, while higher rates of positive behaviours were associated with reduced rates of crash involvement in a period of 5 years. The findings highlight the relationship between errors, total crashes and crash severity Further promotion of positive behaviours amongst riders may also help to reduce the risk of crashes.","output":"Bicycle Rider Behavior and Crash Involvement in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The article aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic about legal migrants in selected European Union countries amidst the tighter restrictions and travel constraints introduced worldwide.

It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia HCW and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHODS: We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian HCW infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. A line list of HCW related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for HCW were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to HCW cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst HCW, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULTS: We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or HCW infection reports between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 HCW in Australia had been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of HCW infection was 90/100000 and of community infection 34/100,000. HCW were 2.69 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.48 to 2.93; Pa?<a?0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 HCW across 21 outbreaks led to 1656 HCW being furloughed for quarantine. In one outbreak, one hospital was closed and 1200 HCW quarantined. CONCLUSION: The study shows that HCW were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, HCW are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous HCW during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faced a resurgence of COVID-19 after the study period, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of HCW infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for HCW.","output":"Estimating the burden of COVID-19 on the Australian healthcare workers and health system during the first six months of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing worldwide pandemic of the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing disease, COVID-19, has presented enormous and unprecedented challenges for all medical specialists However, to date, children, especially neonates, have been relatively spared from the devastating consequences of this infection Neurologic involvement is being increasingly recognized among adults with COVID-19, who can develop sensory deficits in smell and taste, delirium, encephalopathy, headaches, strokes, and peripheral nervous system disorders Among neonates and children, COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations have been relatively rare, yet reports involving neurologic dysfunction in this age range are increasing As discussed in this review, pediatric neurologists and other pediatric specialists should be alert to potential neurological involvement by this virus, which might have neuroinvasive capability and carry long-term neuropsychiatric and medical consequences","output":"COVID-19: Neurological Considerations in Neonates and Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generation Z has seen drastic changes in the medical sector with the health-care industry constantly updating itself with newer tools to provide quality treatment.

Current management of diabetes-related wounds involves the offloading high foot pressures and the treatment of ischemia through revascularisation. Despite these treatments, the global burden of diabetes-related wounds is growing, and thus novel therapies are needed. The normal wound healing process is a coordinated remodelling process orchestrated by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, phagocytes and platelets, controlled by an array of growth factors. In diabetes-related wounds this coordinated process is dysfunctional. Past animal model and human research suggests that prolonged wound inflammation, failure to adequately correct ischemia and impaired wound maturation are key therapeutic targets to improve diabetes-related wound healing. AREAS COVERED This review summarises recent pre-clinical and clinical research on novel diabetes-related wounds treatments. Animal models of diabetes-related wounds and recent studies testing novel agents in these models are described. Findings from clinical trials are also discussed. Finally challenges to identifying and implementing novel therapies are described.

In order to fully understand RNA function it is necessary to define its spatial structure. Crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryogenic electron microscopy have demonstrated considerable success in determining the structures of biologically important RNA molecules.

When the community outbreak was declared, only two national reference laboratories approved by WHO were capable of performing the reference standard test RT-PCR for the diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. However, due to the slow turn around time of processing of RT-PCR samples, lasting 6-10 days prior to release of result, we were crucially in need of a rapid test for diagnostic investigation. This highlights the urgent need to have widespread, reliable diagnostic test.Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Healgen?) in the management of suspected patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Cardinal Santos Medical Center.Methods: Serum blood samples from 164 COVID suspects were collected and subjected to the IgG/IgM rapid antibody test. The results were correlated with the days of illness and their SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR test result. Utilizing the gold standard SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and overall accuracy rates were computed. Antibody detection rates were also computed from onset of patients illness among the confirmed sample population.Results: The sensitivity of the rapid antibody test for symptomatic adult, Covid 19 positive patients seen at Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Philippines from March to May 2020 was 84% (IgM) and 76% (IgG). When both IgM and IgG are positive, the sensitivity and specificity are similar at 80%. The positive likelihood ratio if both antibodies are positive is 4. The specificity for asymptomatic individuals was 98% (IgM) and 96% (IgG). Likewise, the negative predictive values are 96% and 94% for IgM and IgG. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of IgM are 82% and 86% respectively. IgM antibodies were detected early in the first week of illness in 54% of the hospitalized confirmed patients. Detection of IgG on the other hand was highest during the second and third weeks of illness. Total or both antibodies were detectable up to 4 weeks from illness onset. IgM antibodies were detected earlier than IgG. IgM positivity rate was higher than IgG by the second week illness (IgM 100% vs IgG 93%), both antibodies have the same positivity rates up to the fourth week of observation.Conclusion: The Healgen? antibody has good performance rates, it can be applied clinically for the diagnosis of Covid 19 disease in comparison with the standard RT-PCR .

Not only China, the first country that experienced the health crisis since last December, but the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented global health crisis, the most serious crisis in a century, with social and economic impact. However, the most important impact of the new pandemic is the human impact. Till 4th of June 2020, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 65000.000 people and has been responsible for more than 386000 deaths globally. The first priority of public health authorities is to contain and mitigate the spread and infection rate of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, distributing the number of infections over time and, if possible, reduce the incidence of the disease (COVID-19) it causes. A critical task for health systems confronted with the spread of the coronavirus is to protect the health of all citizens, so this requires that both diagnosis/testing and appropriate care should be readily available, affordable, and provided in a safe environment. The health care systems of many developed countries failed to demonstrate a satisfactory response to the increased demand for acute care hospital beds, ventilators, emergency services, diagnostics tests, support equipment for their COVID-19 patients, availability of essential medicines, protective equipment for their staff etc. Nuclear Medicine (NM) departments and their staff, in spite of the fact that not being in the front line of the pandemic response, have experienced a dramatic alteration in their daily clinical activity, trying to adapt their clinical routine to the new environment. There are several issued guidance from national and international organizations, trying to help to cope with suspected or verified COVID-19 patients. Patients with cancer are thought to be more susceptible and have higher morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 than the general population.

Previously we showed that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit is one of the interesting plant resources from which NVs can be obtained at a high yield. In the course of the isolation of NVs from different batches of tomatoes, using the established differential ultracentrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography methods, we occasionally observed the co-isolation of viral particles. Density gradient ultracentrifugation (gUC), using sucrose or iodixanol gradient materials, turned out to be efficient in the separation of NVs from the viral particles. We applied cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the morphological assessment and LCCMS/MS-based proteomics for the protein identification of the gradient fractions. Cryo-TEM showed that a low-density gUC fraction was enriched in membrane-enclosed NVs, while the high-density fractions were rich in rod-shaped objects. Mass spectrometryCbased proteomic analysis identified capsid proteins of tomato brown rugose fruit virus, tomato mosaic virus and tomato mottle mosaic virus. In another batch of tomatoes, we isolated tomato spotted wilt virus, potato virus Y and southern tomato virus in the vesicle sample.

The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate existing evidence on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans and summarize these data in the pandemic era. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for articles in English published up to October 31, 2020. The results were analyzed qualitatively. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195982). RESULTS: Of the 543 articles identified by searching databases, 16 in line with the research objectives were eligible for qualitative review: eight sampled the microbiome using stool, four using nasopharyngeal or throat swab, three using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and one using lung tissue. Fecal microbiome dysbiosis and increased opportunistic pathogens were reported in COVID-19 patients. Several studies suggested the dysbiosis in the lung microbiome of COVID-19 patients with an abundance of opportunistic pathogens using lower respiratory tract samples. The association between COVID-19 severity and the human microbiome remains uncertain.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the parenchymal damage caused by different surgical instruments: a new generation electrosurgical scalpel and two different-wavelength lasers. METHODS Six surgical procedures of pulmonary resection for nodules were performed using a new generation electrosurgical scalpel, a 1318 nm neodymium (Nd:YAG) laser or a 2010 nm thulium laser (two procedures for each instrument). Specimens were analyzed using optical microscopy and scansion electronic microscopy. RESULTS Severe cytostructural damage was found to be present in an average of 1.25 mm in depth from the cutting surface in the patients treated using electrosurgical cautery. The depth of this zone dropped to less than 1 mm in patients treated by laser, being as small as 0.2 mm using the laser with a 2010 nm-wavelength and 0.6 mm with the 1318 nm-wavelength laser.

The aim of this study was to predict the angiographic occlusion status after flow-diverter treatment with computational fluid dynamics using porous media modeling for decision-making in the treatment of large wide-neck aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 27 patients treated with flow-diverter stents were retrospectively analyzed through computational fluid dynamics using pretreatment patient-specific 3D rotational angiography. These patients were classified into no-filling and contrast-filling groups based on the O'Kelly-Marotta scale. The patient characteristics, morphologic variables, and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for understanding the outcomes of the flow-diverter treatment. RESULTS The patient characteristics and morphologic variables were similar between the 2 groups. Flow velocity, wall shear stress, shear rate, modified aneurysmal inflow rate coefficient, and residual flow volume were significantly lower in the no-filling group. A novel parameter, called the normalized residual flow volume, was developed and defined as the residual flow volume normalized by the dome volume. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that the normalized residual flow volume with an average flow velocity of 8.0 cm/s in the aneurysmal dome was the most effective in predicting the flow-diverter treatment outcomes.

Medical education has also undergone similar changes, and online education and assessment methods had to be implemented. Student's perception regarding the same was assessed through this study. Aim: To assess the perception of first year MBBS students about the online education and assessment during the lockdown period of two months. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on the first year MBBS students of North Bengal Medical College (NBMCH) during the COVID-19 Lockdown period. All first year MBBS students of NBMCH were added in WhatsApp groups created for academic purposes by Department of Anatomy, NBMCH during the lockdown period. Respective teachers in the academic groups carried out sharing of Digital Education Material (DEM), holding Online Interaction (OI) and correspondence with students, and taking Online Assessments (OA) through sharing questions framed in Google Forms. After two months, the perception of the students was assessed through a voluntary participation based online survey designed in google forms, the results of which were tabulated later and analysed. Results: A total 95 students (54 Male, 41 Female) out of 200 had participated in the survey. Most students were reliant on smartphones (n=90, 94.7%) and mobile internet (n=78, 82%). Most agreed on DEM being relevant (83.2%) and informative (80.7%) but showed diverging opinion on ease of understanding, revision and overall fulfillment of learning objective. On OI majority students responded positively on promptness, relevancy, informative and helpfulness but only 46.8% considered DEM and OI fulfilled the overall learning objective. Regarding OA students had an overall positive opinion. Comparing the online mode with offline, students mostly preferred the latter, though agreeing that online method of education was effective and it was easier to score in OAs. Conclusion: While most students accepted online education, interaction and assessment positively, at the end most of them still preferred offline mode of education and assessment. This could reflect lack of student-student interaction and indicated need of further studies to explore the matter, to help us approach online education better.","output":"Assessment of online learning procedure through the eyes of medical students in COVID-19 scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos a imunotrombose consiste no processo que envolve a ativa??o concomitante da imunidade inata, hemostasia e endotlio como parte da resposta a patgenos, e vem sendo colocada no centro da fisiopatologia da Covid-19.

Copper surfaces have been reported to inactivate human coronaviruses after several minutes, via the release of Cu cations. Utilization of copper alloys for high-touch surfaces can be a pivotal preemptive strategy for preventing the next pandemic. Understanding the true efficacy by which copper, and copper alloys, inactivate the virus under realistic conditions is essential for tuning intrinsic alloy features such as composition, grain orientation, and surface attributes, to optimize for antiviral function. However, virus inactivation measurements depend on the presence of an assay media (AM) solution as a carrier for the virus, and its effects on the surface properties of pure copper that regulate oxidative copper release are previously unknown. Herein, these properties and the influence of AM on the efficacy of virus inactivation occurring on the surface of pure copper are investigated. The process is uncovered by which a five-fold decrease in virus half-life is observed in simulated real-life conditions, relative to exposure to traditional AM.

Unfortunately, many AYAs, particularly those with chronic medical conditions, may not regularly access primary care to address these issues. This study evaluates the impact of an inpatient reproductive health consult service on reproductive health care. METHODS: A reproductive health-focused screening consult service was initiated in June 2017 at an academic teaching hospital. Patients aged 15 to 26 admitted to pediatric ward teams were eligible for screening. A retrospective chart review was conducted from December 2016 to June 2019 to determine the effect of the consult service on the primary outcome, documentation of a psychosocial assessment, and reproductive health concerns. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-nine encounters were analyzed (345 preintervention and 584 during intervention), representing 675 patients. The proportion of encounters with a documented psychosocial assessment increased from 14.8% to 41.3% during the intervention (P < .001); a reproductive health screening consult was responsible for 37.3% (109 of 292) of the documented assessments. There were high self-reported rates of sexual activity (38%), substance use (47%), and mood concerns (48%) among hospitalized AYA; all behaviors were documented at statistically significant increased frequencies (P < .001) during the intervention compared with preintervention.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F(1,347) = 60.82, p < 0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F(1,347) = 56.54, p < 0.001), financial insecurity (F(1,347) = 19.96, p < 0.001), internalized shame (F(1,347) = 71.40, p < 0.001) and social isolation (F(1,347) = 34.73, p < 0.001). Status as a COVID-19 survivor, having family members infected with COVID-19, being married, economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher overall stigma levels (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related stigma is commonly experienced among COVID-19 survivors even though the outbreak has been well-contained in China.

Several key predictors of perceived travel risks are uncovered, those are categorised as COVID-19 status;transportation services;national sanitary measures;health-care services;accommodation services;ecotourism facilities. Moreover, the potential effects of those factors on perceived COVID-19 related travel risk are likely to be moderated by the trustworthiness of the information.Practical implicationsThe implications of the study are important for researchers and policymakers to better understand and predict travellers behaviour in times of pandemics. These implications are also important to tourism marketers and transport and hospitality service providers to more effectively manage and mitigate the effect of such events.Originality/valueThe study provides an original comprehensive model grounded in the social cognitive theory and protection motivation theory to understand the predictors of perceived travel risks in relation to COVID-19 at a destination.","output":"Minimising perceived travel risk in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic to boost travel and tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In non-endemic settings, transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is rare but potentially fatal and becoming more common with globalization.

While general practitioners care for COVID patients who are less severely ill, hospitals are focused on the care of severely ill COVID-19 patients. STANDARD TREATMENT: The role of emergency medicine (EM) is to rapidly detect the virus, to classify disease severity, and to initiate therapy. In addition, the flow of patients into the hospital must be directed in such a way that optimal care is provided without risk of infecting health care personnel and patients. Despite optimal intensive care treatment, the mortality of patients remains high if organ failure develops, especially in patients who are older or have pre-existing conditions. TREATMENT INNOVATIONS: Rapid diagnosis of patients with SARS-CoV?2 infection together with assessment of disease severity and awareness of organ failure are the mainstays of emergency care. Intensive care is needed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced organ failure, whereby lung failure in these patients requires differentiated ventilation therapies. DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is performed to diagnose SARS-CoV?2 infection. Adjunctive diagnostic measures which enhance diagnostic specificity are lung ultrasound, x?ray, and computed tomography of the lungs. This also allows categorization of the type of COVID-19 pneumonia. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: For early detection and appropriate treatment of SARS-CoV?2 infection, PCR is needed. Adjunctive sonographic and radiological examinations allow the treatment of COVID-19 patients to be tailored according to the specific type of pneumonia.","output":"Notfallmedizinische und intensivmedizinische Aspekte von COVID-19-Infektionen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Study the impact of local policies on near-future hospitalization and mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020 , collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS: We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION: Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making.

UK emergency planning will be improved if planners have a better understanding of the reasons UK HCWs may have for their absenteeism, and what might motivate them to work during an influenza pandemic. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study that explored UK HCWs' views (n = 64) about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and to identify potential sources of any perceived duty on HCWs to work. METHODS: A qualitative study, using focus groups (n = 9) and interviews (n = 5). RESULTS: HCWs across a range of roles and grades tended to feel motivated by a sense of obligation to work through an influenza pandemic. A number of significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so were also identified. Perceived barriers to the ability to work included being ill oneself, transport difficulties, and childcare responsibilities. Perceived barriers to the willingness to work included: prioritising the wellbeing of family members; a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously. Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out. CONCLUSION: Although our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic. The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability. This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc). We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability.","output":"Healthcare workers' attitudes to working during pandemic influenza: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few studies have focused on the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Among them, 53 were moderate cases, and 12 were severe or critical cases. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment data were collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to explore risk factors. RESULTS: The patients with severe/critical cases had obviously higher BMI (average 29.23 vs. 22.79 kg/m2 ) and lower liver computed tomography value (average 50.00 vs. 65.00 mU) than the group of moderate cases. The patients with severe/critical cases had higher fasting glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine compared with patients with moderate cases (all P < 0.01). More severe/critical cases (58.33% vs. 1.92%) had positive urine protein levels. The severe/critical cases also experienced a significant process of serum albumin decline. Logistic regression analysis showed that male sex, high BMI (especially obesity), elevated fasting blood glucose, and urinary protein positivity were all risk factors for young patients with severe COVID-19.

Surveys inquired about trainees stress, well-being, clinical experience and satisfaction with medical education and available support resources during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan (mid-March to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 17/31 trainees and 25/42 faculty responded to the surveys. Eight (47%) trainees reported high stress levels. Nine (57%) were redeployed to cover COVID-19 units. Compared with non-redeployed trainees, redeployed residents reported augmented medical knowledge (89% vs 38%, p=0.05). There was no difference in the two groups regarding overall satisfaction with residency experience, stress levels and didactics attendance. Twenty-one (84%) faculty felt that the redeployment interfered with trainees education but was appropriate, while 10 (59%) trainees described a positive experience overall. Both trainees and faculty believed the pandemic positively impacted trainees experience by increasing maturity level, teamwork, empathy, and medical knowledge, while both agreed that increased stress and anxiety levels were negative outcomes of the pandemic.

Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. METHODS: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, Hazard Ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox Regression models. RESULTS: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids.

METHODS Junior competitive athletes suffering from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent cardiac screening, including physical examination, 12-lead resting ECG, echocardiogram and exercise ECG testing. Further investigations were performed in cases of abnormal findings. RESULTS A total of 571 competitive junior athletes (14.32.5 years) were evaluated. About half of the population (50.3%) was mildly symptomatic during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the average duration of symptoms was 41 days.

In patients recovering from moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, four stages (stages 1-4) of evolution were identified on chest CT with average CT scores of 3.42.3, 6.04.4, 5.63.8, and 4.93.2, respectively, from the onset of symptoms. For most patients, the peak of average total CT score increased for approximately 8 days after the onset of symptoms, after which it decreased gradually. The mean CT score of all patients was 4.7 at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: The moderate COVID-19 pneumonia CT score increased rapidly in a short period of time initially, followed by a slow decline over a relatively long time. The peak of the course occurred in stage 2. Complete recovery of patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with high mean CT score at the time of discharge requires longer time.","output":"Dynamic CT assessment of disease change and prognosis of patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics of febrile infants younger than 90 days with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, to investigate the prevalence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in these infants, and to compare the risk of SBI in SARS-CoV-2-positive febrile infants with sex- and age-matched SARS-CoV- 2-negative febrile infants. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March to November 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and included if age was younger than 90 days, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, and at least 1 bacterial culture was collected. Positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were age- and sex-matched to negative controls for analysis. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, bacteremia, and/or bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Fifty-three SARS-CoV-2-positive infants were identified with a higher rate of respiratory symptoms and lower white blood cell and C-reactive protein values than their SARS-CoV-2 matched controls. The rate of SBI in the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants was 8% compared with 34% in the controls; the most common infections were urinary tract infections (6% vs 23%). There were no cases of bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infants and 2 (4%) cases of bacteremia in the controls. The relative risk of any SBI between the 2 groups was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6; P &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that febrile infants younger than 90 days with COVID-19 have lower rates of SBI than their matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. These data are consistent with previous studies describing lower risks of SBI in febrile infants with concomitant viral respiratory tract infections.","output":"Risk of Serious Bacterial Infections in Young Febrile Infants With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term antibody responses and neutralizing activities following SARS-CoV-2 infections have not yet been elucidated. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of six months following COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, which were among the first world-wide being infected. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increased rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset were associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlated closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. While specific IgM-S/N became undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers showed an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilized at relatively high levels over the six months observation period. At late time points the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was still over 70%.

We developed and validated such a model to predict colorectal cancer death within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. METHODS Cohort study using linked national cancer and death records. The development population included 27,480 patients diagnosed in England in 2015. The test populations were diagnosed in England in 2016 (n = 26,411) and Wales in 2015-2016 (n = 3814). Predictors were age, gender, socioeconomic status, referral source, performance status, tumour site, TNM stage and treatment intent. Cox regression models were assessed using Brier scores, c-indices and calibration plots. RESULTS In the development population, 7.4, 11.7 and 17.9% of patients died from colorectal cancer within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. T4 versus T1 tumour stage had the largest adjusted association with the outcome (HR 4.67; 95% CI: 3.59-6.09). C-indices were 0.873-0.890 (England) and 0.856-0.873 (Wales) in the test populations, indicating excellent separation of predicted risks by outcome status. Models were generally well calibrated.

The mental health service at the polyclinic in the Olympic village was open three times a week from 10 am to 7 pm. Five board-certified psychiatrists were assigned to work in rotation, and on-call telephone support was provided during the absence of a physician on duty. Eight patients visited the polyclinic for mental health services during the Olympics. Among them, three were athletes and five, members of the team staff. During the Paralympics, two patients, both of whom were members of the team staff, visited the polyclinic for mental health services. Thus, 11 people were examined at the polyclinic throughout the Olympic and Paralympic games. All patients, except for one, met the diagnostic criteria for Adjustment Disorder. During the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, those who tested positive for COVID-19 had to follow quarantine rules which possibly took a toll on their mental health. The organizing committee of the games announced that a total of 863 athletes and officials had tested positive, of which 41 were athletes. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were promptly quarantined at a designated isolation facility. Although holding the Olympic and Paralympic games under pandemic conditions appears unprecedented, future games may need to be held in similar circumstances. Therefore, it is critical to summarize the issues ahead of the 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. While it is uncertain whether the pandemic will be under control by then, we suggest that the psychological support system for athletes and officials should be further developed and expanded. The polyclinic at the 2020 Games consisted of only psychiatrists and lacked clinical psychologists. Therefore, the importance of deploying well-trained psychologists among the policlinic staff should be emphasized.

In this study, we have standardized a highly specific and reproducible multiplexing mass spectrometry method using the tandem mass tag (TMT) strategy in combination with depletion of abundant proteins from serum and high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation. Differential proteome profiling of 4 year-old DMD boys (n = 9) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 9) identified 38 elevated and 50 decreased serum proteins (adjusted P < 0.05, FDR <0.05) in the DMD group relative to the healthy control group. As expected, we confirmed previously reported biomarkers but also identified novel biomarkers. These included novel muscle injury-associated biomarkers such as telethonin, smoothelin-like protein 1, cofilin-1, and plectin, additional muscle-specific enzymes such as UTPCglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase PKM, lactotransferrin, tissue alpha-l-fucosidase, pantetheinase, and ficolin-1, and some pro-inflammatory and cell adhesion-associated biomarkers such as leukosialin, macrophage receptor MARCO, vitronectin, galectin-3-binding protein, and ProSAAS. The workflow including serum depletion, sample processing, and mass spectrometry analysis was found to be reproducible and stable over time with CV < 20%.

The antiretroviral drug favipiravir (FPV) has been experimentally used for COVID-19 treatment since March 2020 in Japan. However, the pharmacokinetics of FPV in critically ill patients is unknown. We measured the serum concentration of FPV using high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patients were administered 1,600 mg of FPV twice daily on day 1, followed by 600 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 5 (or more if needed). Suspensions of FPV tablets were administered through a nasogastric tube. Seven patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-nine blood samples were obtained from the eligible patients to evaluate FPV concentration. The FPV trough (after 8-12 hours) concentrations of most samples were lower than the lower limit of quantification (1 g/mL) and half-maximal effective concentration (9.7 g/mL) against SARS-CoV-2 previously tested in vitro. FPV trough concentration in critically ill patients was much lower than that of healthy subjects in a previous clinical trial, which is a cause for great concern.

A total of 3835 recreational runners completed an online survey. Runners were assigned to dietary (omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan) and race distance (<21 km, half-marathon, and marathon/ultra-marathon) groups. In addition to sociodemographic information, a complete profile of data sets focusing on running and racing behaviors/patterns was evaluated using a questionnaire-based epidemiological approach. There were 1272 omnivores (47% females), 598 vegetarians (64% females), and 994 vegans (65% females). Compared to vegans and vegetarians, omnivorous runners prepared for a longer time period for running events, had a higher number of half-marathons and marathons completed with a better finish time, and had more reliance on training under supervision (p < 0.05).

A possible relationship between the type of ventilation used in the operating room and surgical site infection has been reported. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS A systematic literature search up to May 2020 identified 14 studies with 590,121 operations, 328,183 operations of which were performed under laminar airflow ventilation and 261,938 of which were performed operations under conventional ventilation. These articles reported relationships between type of operating-room ventilation with its different categories and surgical site infection: 10 studies were related to surgical site infection in the total hip replacement; 7 studies in total knee arthroplasties; and 3 studies in different abdominal and open vascular surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated comparing surgical site infection prevalence and type of operating room ventilation using the dichotomous method with a random-effects or fixed-effects model. RESULTS No significant difference was found between operation performed under laminar airflow ventilation and conventional ventilation in total hip replacement (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.56, P = .09), in total knee arthroplasties (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.62-2.09; P = .67), and in different abdominal and open vascular surgery (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43-1.33; P = .33).

Compression therapy is recommended as the gold standard treatment in clinical practice, although a large number of venous leg ulcers remain unhealed after several years. Physical activity may improve healing although there is limited evidence on the effects of physical activity as an adjuvant treatment to compression to improve venous leg ulcers healing and prevent recurrence. Objectives: This scoping review protocol aims to systematically search, appraise, and synthesize quantitative research evidence to assess the effect of physical activity interventions applied in conjunction with compression therapy on venous leg ulcer healing and recurrence. Methods and Analysis: We will use the methodology framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al., the JBI as a guide. We will also follow the three-step search strategy recommended by the JBI to systematic search for relevant published research, ongoing clinical trials, and grey literature. Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts followed by full-text review to determine final eligibility for inclusion. The search process will be reported using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow chart. Characteristics of physical activity interventions, primary outcomes related to ulcer healing and recurrence, and secondary outcomes of interest included quality of life, pain level, adverse effects, and economic costs will be extracted and summarized. The review will provide a descriptive account of the findings from included studies. Where appropriate, data will be pooled for a meta-analysis using a random effects model.

Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family.

Among them, we identified 36 patients whose tissue samples were of suitable quality for clinical sequencing, and we analyzed the genomic profiles of these tumors. RESULTS: Pathogenic alterations were detected in 28 (78%) of the 36 patients. The most common mutation was TP53 (55%), followed by KRAS (22%), and the highest frequency of gene amplification was ERBB2 (17%). Nine of the 36 patients were identified as candidates for novel molecular-targeted therapy based on their actionable gene alterations, but only one case ended up receiving novel targeted therapy following the genetic tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our current results suggested that clinical sequencing might be useful for the detection of pathogenic alterations and the management of additional cancer treatment. However, molecular target based on actionable genomic alteration does not always bridge to subsequent therapy due to clinical deterioration, refusal for unapproved drug, and complexity of clinical trial access.

Time taken to apply the PO sensor, to display data and to display accurate data (HR(PO) = HR(ECG)  3 bpm) were recorded using a stopwatch. RESULTS Forty infants were studied [mean (SD) birthweight, 1455 (872) g; gestational age, 31 (4) weeks; post-menstrual age, 34 (4) weeks]. Method 3 acquired any data significantly faster than methods 1 (p = 0.013; CI, -9.6 to -3.0 sec) and 2 (p = 0.004; CI, -5.9 to -1.2 sec). Method 3 acquired accurate data significantly faster than method 1 (p = 0.016; CI, -9.4 to -1.0 sec), but not method 2 (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION Applying the sensor to the infant before connecting it to the cable yields the fastest acquisition of accurate HR data from the Nellcor PO.","output":"Determining the best method of Nellcor pulse oximeter sensor application in neonates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. This study aimed at identifying the stress and anxiety levels among physicians and nurses working in Romanian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods and Results. We conducted an online survey with a questionnaire completed by 169 healthcare providers aged between 25 and 69 years from COVID and non-COVID hospitals. There were 87.6% physicians and 12.4% nurses, with 61.5% women and 38.5% men. Clinicians experienced high levels of stress in 2.7% of the cases, medium stress in 68.9% of the cases, and low stress in 28.4% of the cases. Women experienced more stress (2.9% high level, 66.3% medium level) than men (1.5% high level, 64.6% medium level), while men are more anxious (73.8% high level, 26.2% medium level) than women (63.6% high level, 33.7% medium level). In both COVID and non-COVID healthcare providers, the stress score directly correlates with the anxiety score. Overall, during this period, the responders felt stressed and anxious (p=0.001). Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic is a strong reason for increased stress and anxiety among physicians and nurses. Men are more anxious and women more stressed.

DESIGN: Cohort study of women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 1 July 2020. SETTING: London Teaching Hospital. POPULATION: All women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 13 May 2020 and follow up of women screening negative between 1 April 2020 and 13 May 2020. METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rate of gestational diabetes. RESULTS: Using the RCOG guidance, the overall rate of women identified as having gestational diabetes fell from 7.7% (1853/24168) to 4.2% (35/831)(P = 0.0003).

Using 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, we found differential -diversity using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with Bray-Curtis distances. The -diversity analysis by Faiths, Shannon, and observed OTUs indexes indicated that the saliva samples from HIV-infected individuals harbored significantly richer bacterial communities compared to the saliva samples from healthy individuals. Notably, we observed that five species of Spirochaeta including Spirochaetaceae, Spirochaeta, Treponema, Treponema amylovorum, and Treponema azotonutricum were significantly abundant. In contrast, Helicobacter species were significantly reduced in the saliva of HIV-infected individuals. Moreover, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of oral neutrophils in the oral cavity of HIV-infected individuals, which was positively related to their CD4(+) T cell count. In particular, we noted a significant decline in CD44 expressing neutrophils and the intensity of CD44 expression on oral neutrophils of HIV-infected individuals. This observation was supported by the elevation of soluble CD44 in the saliva of HIV-infected individuals. Overall, the core oral microbiome was distinguishable between HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy compared to the HIV-negative group.

In this study, comprehensive transcriptomic alterations of 14 tissues from rhesus macaque infected with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Compared to normal controls, SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in dysregulation of genes involving diverse functions in various examined tissues/organs, with drastic transcriptomic changes in cerebral cortex and right ventricle. Intriguingly, cerebral cortex exhibited a hyperinflammatory state evidenced by significant upregulation of inflammation response-related genes.

The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children <18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated before the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 9812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-19.8; P = .003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI, 1.59-130.39; P = .02) for SARS-CoV-2-positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with nonsevere SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection.

This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Turkish people and to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Turkish people. METHODS: The research was carried out between March and April 2020. A Personal Information Form and the FCV-19S were used to collect the research data. In the validity and reliability stage, 84 people were contacted randomly for data collection. After the validity and reliability analyses of the scale, a total of 431 Turkish people volunteered to participate in the study and answered the questions in the online questionnaire form using a convenience and snowball sampling method. Confirmatory factor analysis, item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were calculated for psychometric evaluation. Bivariate analysis was applied to determine the level of fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, which is stated to have high reliability. FCV-19S scores of participants were determined to be 21.47  6.28. FCV-19S scores of females were determined as 20.48  6.33 and FCV-19S scores of males were determined as 19.78  7.34 according to the bivariate analysis (p < .05). Age, marital status, having children and living alone or with others, tobacco use and anxiety about going to the hospital during the pandemic did not affect on fear of COVID-19 (p > .05). Particularly being female, the presence of chronic disease requiring long-term medication and rarely taking protective measures recommended by the Ministry of Health and having a chronic disease had a significant effect on higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool for determining the fear of COVID-19.

We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Methods: Ninety-five symptomatic outpatients self-collected midturbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. Samples were tested for viral RNA, virus culture, and SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus antibodies, and associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Viral RNA clearance, as measured by SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in 507 URT samples occurred a median (interquartile range) 33.5 (17-63.5) days post-symptom onset. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR-positive samples tested. All participants but 1 with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The mean time to first antibody detection in oral fluid was 8-13 days post-symptom onset.

The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the viral proteins is known as an effective antiviral target. Lycorine is a phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L'Hr.) Herb. and has various pharmacological bioactivities including antiviral function. Purpose: We investigated the direct-inhibiting action of lycorine on CoV's RdRp, as potential treatment for emerging CoV infections. Methods: We examined the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and then quantitatively measured the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV RdRp activity using a cell-based reporter assay. Finally, we performed the docking simulation with lycorine and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Results: Lycorine efficiently inhibited these CoVs with IC(50) values of 2.1230.053, 1.0210.025, and 0.8780.022 M, respectively, comparable with anti-CoV effects of remdesivir. Lycorine directly inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity with an IC(50) of 1.406  0.260 M, compared with remdesivir's IC(50) value of 6.335  0.731 M. In addition, docking simulation showed that lycorine interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp at the Asp623, Asn691, and Ser759 residues through hydrogen bonding, at which the binding affinities of lycorine (?6.2 kcal/mol) were higher than those of remdesivir (?4.7 kcal/mol). Conclusions: Lycorine is a potent non-nucleoside direct-acting antiviral against emerging coronavirus infections and acts by inhibiting viral RdRp activity; therefore, lycorine may be a candidate against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Lycorine, a non-nucleoside RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, as potential treatment for emerging coronavirus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a non-technical assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual level conflict behavior in the household, workplace, and societal interactions in the post-COVID era We predict that there will be an increase in the intra-household conflict including domestic violence;and the divorce rate will rise Within workplaces, the pandemic will result both in a higher level of sabotage among the employees, and employee retaliation towards the employer The pandemic may also affect the diversity and inclusiveness within an organization adversely In societal interactions, an increase in the identity related conflicts - especially related to the immigration status can be observed It is also likely that there will be an increase in the attack and defense or victimization activities in the society We conclude by proposing various measures for conflict resolution, and a few possible areas of further investigations","output":"Conflict in the Time of (Post-) Corona: Some Assessments from Behavioral Economics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic to tropical areas in Asia and the Western Pacific. It can cause fatal encephalitis, although most infected individuals are asymptomatic. JEV is mainly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, but can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. To manage the potential risk of transfusion transmission, pathogen inactivation (PI) technologies, such as THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets systems, have been developed. We examined the efficacy of these two PI systems to inactivate JEV. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Japanese encephalitis virus-spiked plasma units were treated using the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system (visible light doses, 20, 40, 60, and 120 [standard] J/cm2) in the presence of methylene blue at approximately 0.8 mol/L and spiked platelet concentrates (PCs) were treated using the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system (UVC doses, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 [standard] J/cm2). Samples were taken before the first and after each illumination dose and tested for infectivity using an immunoplaque assay. RESULTS Treatment of plasma with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system resulted in an average of 6.59 log reduction in JEV infectivity at one-sixth of the standard visible light dose (20 J/cm2). For PCs, treatment with the THERAFLEX UV-Platelet system resulted in an average of 7.02 log reduction in JEV infectivity at the standard UVC dose (0.20 J/cm2).

Interpopulational differences in genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies and in linkage disequilibrium structure for these SNPs were detected. These frequencies correlated with the ethnicity of the populations and with their supposed differential exposure to the TBE virus. In particular, the lowest frequencies of G/G genotype for OAS3 SNP rs2072136 (which, according to our earlier results, is associated with predisposition to severe forms of TBE) were found in Altaians, Khakass, Tuvinians, and Shorians, who commonly contact with the TBE virus in their habitation regions.

Our first objective was to identify behavioral language and speech markers of early-stage PPA. Our second objective was to identify the electrophysiological correlates of the language and speech characteristics in PPA. Method The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant articles. To identify behavioral markers, the initial subjective complaints and the language and speech deficits detected during the initial diagnostic evaluation were summarized for PPA in general and each clinical variant according to the 2011 consensus diagnostic criteria (nonfluent variant [NFV], semantic variant, and logopenic variant [LV]). To identify electrophysiological markers, the studies in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were elicited by a language or speech paradigm in patients with PPA were included. Results In total, 114 relevant studies were identified, including 110 behavioral studies and only four electrophysiological studies. This review suggests that patients with the semantic variant could be accurately differentiated from the NFV and LV in the initial stages based on the consensus criteria. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between the NFV and LV is not straightforward. In the four electrophysiological studies, differences in the latency, amplitude, and topographical distribution of the semantic N400 component were found between patients with PPA and healthy controls. Conclusions To accurately differentiate the NFV from the LV, it could be important to assess the language and speech degeneration by more specific assessments and by more objective diagnostic methods that offer insights into the language-related processes. Electrophysiological markers of PPA were not identified in this review due to the low number of studies that investigated language-related ERPs.

We evaluated the stability of flocked swabs inoculated with SARS-CoV-2-containing specimen incubated dry (i.e. without transport medium) at room temperature. METHODS: A pool of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen was used to inoculate flocked swabs. Five swabs were placed immediately into UTM following inoculation, and tested immediately (day 0). Fifteen of the swabs were placed into sterile 15 mL conical tubes and incubated at room temperature for one, two, or seven days. Following incubation, swabs were hydrated in separate vials of UTM and tested. This protocol was repeated for viral transport media (VTM) and saline. As a comparison, a series of swabs was prepared and tested in parallel, but stored in the corresponding liquid transport media (UTM, VTM, or saline) and incubated at room temperature. Testing was performed at 1, 2, and 7 days post inoculation in duplicate. All molecular testing was performed using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: All dry swabs tested at days 1, 2, and 7 provided results that were within two cycle thresholds (Cts) of the average Ct values for swabs hydrated in the same media and tested on day 0. There was no statistical difference in Ct values between swabs incubated in liquid media versus dry swabs incubated at room temperature prior to hydration in liquid media. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of dry swabs may simplify specimen collection, negate the need for liquid transport media, and mitigate safety risks while preserving the accuracy of testing.","output":"The Effects of Dry Swab Incubation on SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is an important preventive health measure to protect against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Impaired immunity secondary to an underlying malignancy or recent receipt of anti-neoplastic systemic therapies can result in less robust antibody titres following vaccination and possible risk of breakthrough infection. As clinical trials evaluating COVID-19 vaccines largely excluded patients with a history of cancer and those on active immunosuppression (including chemotherapy), limited evidence is available to inform the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination across the spectrum of patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical features of patients with cancer who developed symptomatic COVID-19 following vaccination and compare weighted outcomes to those of contemporary unvaccinated patients, after adjustment for confounders, using data from the multi-institutional COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04354701). RESULTS: Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 following vaccination have substantial comorbidities and can present with severe and even lethal infection. Patients harboring hematologic malignancies are over-represented among vaccinated patients with cancer who develop symptomatic COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against COVID-19 remains an essential strategy in protecting vulnerable populations, including patients with cancer. However, patients with cancer who develop breakthrough infection despite full vaccination remain at risk of severe outcomes. A multilayered public health mitigation approach that includes vaccination of close contacts, boosters, social distancing, and mask-wearing should be continued for the foreseeable future.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination and Breakthrough Infections in Patients with Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE We report the case of a patient with consecutive infections with several multidrug-resistant agents-including carbapenem-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae among others-from a surgical wound infection after lumbar spine fusion, only successfully treated after the resort to novel antibiotics (ceftazidime-avibactam) in combination therapy.

Here we tested intravenous BCG vaccination against COVID-19 using the golden Syrian hamster model together with immune profiling and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We observed that BCG reduced both lung SCV2 viral load and bronchopneumonia. This was accompanied by an increase in lung alveolar macrophages, a reversal of SCV2-mediated T cell lymphopenia, and reduced lung granulocytes. Single cell transcriptome profiling showed that BCG uniquely recruits immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells to the lung suggesting accelerated antibody production. BCG vaccination also recruited elevated levels of Th1, Th17, Treg, CTLs, and Tmem cells, and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed a transcriptional shift away from exhaustion markers and towards antigen presentation and repair. Similarly, BCG enhanced lung recruitment of alveolar macrophages and reduced key interstitial macrophage subsets, with both cell-types also showing reduced IFN-associated gene expression.

To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization. Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system. Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms. In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation. Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight. Conclusions: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system.

Commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy, especially in calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies (MDA). We previously reported that an experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, but not a commercial vaccine, induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with MDA, immunized at 7C15 weeks of age. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals, representing the target population for vaccination. Four groups of five 3C8 week old calves with variable levels of BRSV-specific MDA were immunized s.c. twice at a 3 weeks interval with (i) BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), (ii) BRSV-protein, (iii) adjuvant, or (iv) PBS. All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection. The cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs, the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge. Despite presence of MDA at the time of the immunization, only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the BRSV-ISCOM group after challenge. In contrast, in all control groups, clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals (respiratory rates up to 76 min(?1) and rectal temperatures up to 41 C). The clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves, rapid systemic and local antibody responses and T helper cell responses dominated by IFN production. Animals that did not shed virus detectable by PCR or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary IgA.

However, retrospective studies suggest that some patients may have improved survival with local treatment of their liver metastases compared to systemic therapy alone. In the absence of randomized trials, it is important to identify patient characteristics indicating that benefit from local treatment can be expected. METHODS 59 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), interstitial brachytherapy (BT), or radioembolization (RE) of LMBC as a salvage treatment were studied. Potential factors influencing survival were analyzed in a multivariate Cox model. For factors identified to have an independent survival impact, Kaplan-Meier analysis and comparison of overall survival (OS) using the log-rank test was performed. RESULTS Median OS following local interventional treatment was 21.9 months. Considering only factors evaluable at treatment initiation, maximum diameter of liver metastases (3.9 cm; HR: 3.1), liver volume ( 1376 mL; HR: 2.3), and history of prior chemotherapy ( 3 lines of treatment; HR: 2.5-2.6) showed an independent survival impact. When follow-up data were included in the analysis, significant factors were maximum diameter of liver metastases ( 3.9 cm; HR: 3.1), control of LMBC during follow-up (HR: 0.29), and objective response as best overall response (HR: 0.21). Neither the presence of any extrahepatic metastases nor presence of bone metastases only had a significant survival impact. Median OS was 38.7 vs. 16.1 months in patients with metastases < vs.  3.9 cm, 36.6 vs. 10.2 months for patients having objective response vs. stable/progressive disease, and 38.5 vs. 14.2 months for patients having controlled vs. non-controlled disease at follow-up. CONCLUSION Local control of LMBC confers a survival benefit and local interventional treatment for LMBC should be studied in a randomized trial. Patients with small metastases and limited history of systemic LMBC treatment are most likely to benefit from local approaches. Limited extrahepatic disease should not lead to exclusion from a randomized study and should not be a contraindication for local LMBC treatment as long as no randomized data are available.","output":"Locally ablative treatment of breast cancer liver metastases: identification of factors influencing survival (the Mammary Cancer Microtherapy and Interventional Approaches (MAMMA MIA) study)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hawkes processes are a form of self-exciting process that has been used in numerous applications, including neuroscience, seismology, and terrorism. While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","output":"Simple discrete-time self-exciting models can describe complex dynamic processes: A case study of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public acceptability of nudging is receiving increasingly more attention, but studies remain limited to evaluations of aspects of the nudge itself or (inferred intentions) of the nudger. Yet, it is important to investigate which individuals are likely to accept nudges, as those who are supposed to benefit from the implementation should not oppose it. The main objective of this study was to integrate research on self-regulation and nudging, and to examine acceptability of nudges as a function of self-regulation capacity and motivation. METHOD: Participants (N = 301) filled in questionnaires about several components of self-regulation capacity (self-control, proactive coping competence, self-efficacy, perceived control and perceived difficulty) and motivation (autonomous motivation and controlled motivation). To evaluate nudge acceptability, we used three vignettes describing three types of nudges (default, portion size, and rearrangement) that stimulated either a pro-self behavior (healthy eating) or pro-social behavior (sustainable eating) and asked participants to rate the nudges on (aspects of) acceptability. RESULTS: Results revealed that there were substantial differences in acceptability between the three types of nudges, such that the default nudge was seen as less acceptable and the rearrangement nudge as most acceptable. The behavior that was stimulated did not affect acceptability, even though the nudges that targeted healthy eating were seen as more pro-self than the nudges targeting sustainable eating. From all self-regulation components, autonomous motivation was the only measure that was consistently associated with nudge acceptability across the three nudges. For self-regulatory capacity, only some elements were occasionally related to acceptability for some nudges. CONCLUSION: The current study thus shows that people are more inclined to accept nudges that target behaviors that they are autonomously motivated for, while people do not meaningfully base their judgments of acceptability on self-regulatory capacity.","output":"Who accepts nudges? nudge acceptability from a self-regulation perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study, biospecimens from more than 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals have thus far been collected in the GEN-COVID Biobank (GCB).

Design/methodology/approach - The authors have assessed investors' behaviors and sentiments and the stock market overreaction during COVID-19 using a questionnaire and collected data from 401 investors trading in the PSX. Findings - Results of structural equation modeling revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected investors' behaviors, investment decisions and trade volume. It created feelings of fear and uncertainty among market participants. Evidence suggests that behavioral heuristics and biases, including representative heuristic, anchoring heuristic, overconfidence bias and disposition effect, negatively influenced investors' decisions at the PSX. Research limitations/implications - This study will contribute to behavioral finance literature in the context of developing countries as it has revealed the impact of COVID-19 on the emerging stock market, and its results are generalizable to other emerging stock markets. Practical implications - The findings of this study will help academicians, researchers and policymakers of developing countries. Academicians can formulate new behavioral models that can depict the solutions of dealing with an uncertain situation like COVID-19. Policymakers like the Securities Exchange Commission and the PSX can formulate crisis management strategies based on behavioral finance concepts to cope with situations like COVID-19 in the future and help lessen investors' losses in the stock markets. The role of the Securities Exchange Commission is crucial as it regulates the financial markets.

The study included 3037 participants (mean age = 17.7 years, 74.6% female). AYAs had higher mean (standard deviation (SD)) risk perception of COVID-19 for their relatives (8.2 (1.9)) than for themselves (5.6 (2.6)) (p < 0.001). Factors associated with higher risk perception included higher disease knowledge (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.06, 95% CI 1.01C1.11), presence of chronic disease (aOR 2.31, 95%CI 1.82C2.93) and use of immunosuppressants (aOR 2.53, 95%CI 1.67C3.87).

Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with R(0) = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23% of the resident population. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns are very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population fully immune. When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: From lockdown to vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background COVID-19 is spreading globally.

A new moment has been established, since the application of well-known, effective and safe medications for other diseases, has shown high success rates in the treatment of COVID-19. Thereunto, studies with early intervention are needed, which can change the unfavorable outcome of patients. In this article, we report the successful experience using an oral strategy during the collapse of Belem (Para, Brazil) Health System. Two hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COVID-19, with no option of hospital treatment due to lack of beds and resources. These patients were then started on therapeutic regimen consisting of 40 mg prednisolone, 40 mg enoxaparin and macrolides (500 mg clarithromycin, 500 mg axetylcefuroxime) associated and followed in outpatient facilities. Two hundred and eight patients had an excellent therapeutic response and there were only two fatalities. These results push research boundaries, valuing outpatient treatment with early use of prednisolone in the initial pulmonary phase, preventing severe COVID-19 pneumonitis.

At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males.

Here, we aimed to investigate the association between NLR, PLR, and hematological parameters in sarcoidosis. The study was performed with 75 sarcoidosis patients and 92 controls. Patients' NLR, PLR, and hematological parameters were compared with those of controls. Additionally, while differences between NLR and PLR were investigated in sarcoidosis patients, differences of extrapulmonary involvement, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and spontaneous remission between those with and without responses to treatment concerning stages were also assessed. NLR and PLR were significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients than controls. For NLR, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were found as 68, 61, 58, and 70% respectively, while sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for PLR were found as 72, 67, 63, and 74%, respectively. In sarcoidosis patients, NLR and PLR were significantly higher at stage-2 and -3 than at stage -1 and -4. There was a significant weak positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and NLR and PLR. Mean platelet volume (MPV), hemoglobin (Hgb), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were lower among patients than controls. A positive moderate correlation was detected between NLR and CD4/CD8 in blood, while there was a strong positive correlation between CD4/CD8 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and positive moderate correlation between PLR and CD4/CD8 in BAL. High NLR and PLR values were not significantly associated with pulmonary PH, spontaneous remission, response to treatment, and prognosis. The increase in PLR and NLR may be a guide for diagnoses of both sarcoidosis and lung parenchymal involvement.

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials.

Critically however, little is known about vaccine confidence among primary care physicians themselves. The objective of this study was to assess both physician confidence that in general, vaccines are safe, effective, and important, as well as physician confidence in each COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. METHODS: We rely on data from a national survey of primary care physicians conducted from May 14-May 25, 2021. We assess the influence of demographic, social, and political factors on physician beliefs that in general, vaccines are safe, effective, and important, as well as physician confidence in the safety of the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 10.1% of primary care physicians do not agree that, in general, vaccines are safe, 9.3% do not agree they are effective, and 8.3% do not agree they are important. While 68.7% of physicians were very confident in the safety of the Moderna vaccine and 72.7% were very confident in the safety of the Pfizer vaccine, only 32.1% of physicians were very confident in the safety of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A troubling proportion of primary care physicians lack high levels of vaccine confidence. These physicians may not be well positioned to actively promote COVID-19 vaccination even as political and media narratives push physicians to lead this effort.

These derivatives constitute intermediates in the synthesis of indole (ervatamine-silicine) alkaloids and share a tetracyclic structure with an indole and a piperidine fused to a seven-membered carbocyclic ring. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated the importance of substituent at C-6 position and especially the presence of a benzylester for the activity and cytotoxicity of the molecules. In addition, the stereochemistry at C-7 and C-8 positions, as well as the presence of oxazolidine ring influenced the potency of the compounds. Mechanism of action studies with two analogues of this family (compounds 22 and trans-14) showed that this class of molecules can suppress viral infection during the later stages of the replication cycle (RNA replication/assembly). Moreover, a cell-dependent antiviral profile of the compounds against several Zika strains was observed, thus possibly implying the involvement of cellular factor(s) in the activity of the molecules. Sequencing of compounds-resistant Zika mutants revealed a single non-synonymous amino acid mutation (aspartic acid to histidine) at the beginning of the predicted transmembrane domain 1 of NS4B protein, which plays a vital role in the formation of the viral replication complex. To conclude, our study provides detailed information on a new class of NS4B-associated inhibitors and strengthens the importance of identifying host-viral interactions in order to tackle flavivirus infections.","output":"A novel series of indole alkaloid derivatives inhibit dengue and Zika virus infection by interference with the viral replication complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We compared the performance of the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (Abbott assay), Aptima?

Hence, reducing vaccine hesitancy is the next challenge for policymakers and the healthcare system. However, people trust healthcare professionals more than any other source of information. Accordingly, planning for an effective process and competent healthcare professional to elicit and address the patient's concerns is an imperative measure. This quality improvement project aimed to improve physicians COVID-19 vaccine advice to reduce vaccine hesitancy. Methods: The study used judgmental sampling and involved 665 hesitant patients over 19 weeks. The team utilized the Plan-Do-Study-Act method to implement COVID-19 vaccine physicians reminders and upgrades physicians communication skills to conduct an effective tailored communication that addresses the patients concerns toward COVID-19 vaccines. The team used pre-post design to evaluate the impact of counseling on the hesitancy rate of patients before and after the intervention over time. The main outcomes were the percentage of physicians COVID-19 vaccine advice for patients and the percentage of hesitancy rate before and after implementation. Results: There were 665 hesitant patients before intervention. However, after the intervention, the number decreased to 193 patients, and the control chart revealed a reliable process. The percentage of recommendations by physicians has increased from 1% to 51% after 19 weeks of implementation and with a controlled process. Conclusion: The study has found that rectifying process barriers and upgrading physicians skills would improve the COVID-19 vaccine counseling rate and introducing tailored communication would reduce the hesitancy rate.

While previous multiple regression studies have identified several predictors for the number of COVID-19-related deaths, little is known for the association with mask non-wearing rate possibly because the data is available for limited number of countries, which constricts the application of traditional multiple regression approach to screen a large number of potential predictors. In this study, we used the hypothesis-driven regression approach to test the association with limited number of predictors based on the hypothesis that the mask non-wearing rate can predict the number of deaths to a large extent together with age and BMI, other relatively independent risk factors for hospitalized patients of COVID-19. The mask non-wearing rate, percentage of age [a?] 80 (male), and male BMI showed Spearman's correlations up to about 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, with the numbers of deaths per million in 22 countries from mid-March to mid-June, 2020. The observed numbers of deaths per million were significantly correlated with those predicted by the lasso regression model including four predictors, age [a?] 80 (male), male BMI, and mask non-wearing rates from mid-March and late April to early May (Pearson's coefficient = 0.919). The multiple linear regression models including the mask non-wearing rates, age, and obesity-related predictors explained up to 75% variation of the number of deaths per million in the 22 countries with little concerns about multicollinearity. Furthermore, linear regressions using the mask non-wearing rate in mid-March as the sole predictor still explained up to 72% of the variation of the numbers of deaths from March to mid-June, emphasizing the importance of the strongest predictor. Although further verification is needed to identify causes of the national differences in COVID-19 mortality rates, these findings highlight the importance of the mask, age, and BMI in predicting the COVID-19-related deaths, providing a useful strategy for future regression analyses that attempt to contribute to the mechanistic understanding of COVID-19.","output":"Face mask wearing rate predicts country's COVID-19 death rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In many countries, patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are told to self-isolate at home, but imperfect compliance and shared living space with uninfected people limit the effectiveness of home-based isolation We examine the impact of facility-based isolation compared to self-isolation at home on the continuing epidemic in the USA METHODS: We developed a compartment model to simulate the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 and calibrated it to key epidemic measures in the USA from March to September 2020 We simulated facility-based isolation strategies with various capacities and starting times under different diagnosis rates Our primary model outcomes are new infections and deaths over 2 months from October 2020 onwards In addition to national-level estimations, we explored the effects of facility-based isolation under different epidemic burdens in major US Census Regions We performed sensitivity analyses by varying key model assumptions and parameters RESULTS: We find that facility-based isolation with moderate capacity of 5 beds per 10 000 total population could avert 4 17 (95% credible interval 1 65-7 11) million new infections and 16 000 (8000-23 000) deaths in 2 months compared with home-based isolation These results are equivalent to relative reductions of 57% (44-61%) in new infections and 37% (27-40%) in deaths Facility-based isolation with high capacity of 10 beds per 10 000 population could achieve reductions of 76% (62-84%) in new infections and 52% (37-64%) in deaths when supported by expanded testing with an additional 20% daily diagnosis rate Delays in implementation would substantially reduce the impact of facility-based isolation The effective capacity and the impact of facility-based isolation varied by epidemic stage across regions CONCLUSION: Timely facility-based isolation for mild COVID-19 cases could substantially reduce the number of new infections and effectively curb the continuing epidemic in the USA Local epidemic burdens should determine the scale of facility-based isolation strategies","output":"Curbing the COVID-19 pandemic with facility-based isolation of mild cases: a mathematical modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective We assessed the knowledge, preparedness, and attitude of health profession students towards COVID-19 outbreak in Sub-Saharan Africa.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in elderberry supplements to treat or prevent illness, but also concern that elderberry might overstimulate the immune system and increase the risk of 'cytokine storm'. We aimed to determine benefits and harms of elderberry for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory infections, and to assess the relationship between elderberry supplements and negative health impacts associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases, four research registers, and two preprint sites for studies. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data from studies, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tools, and evaluated certainty of estimates using GRADE. Outcomes included new illnesses and the severity and duration of illness. RESULTS: We screened 1187 records and included five randomized trials on elderberry for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illness. We did not find any studies linking elderberry to clinical inflammatory outcomes. However, we found three studies measuring production of cytokines ex vivo after ingestion of elderberry. Elderberry may not reduce the risk of developing the common cold; it may reduce the duration and severity of colds, but the evidence is uncertain. Elderberry may reduce the duration of influenza but the evidence is uncertain. Compared to oseltamivir, an elderberry-containing product may be associated with a lower risk of influenza complications and adverse events. We did not find evidence on elderberry and clinical outcomes related to inflammation. However, we found evidence that elderberry has some effect on inflammatory markers, although this effect may decline with ongoing supplementation. One small study compared elderberry to diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and provided some evidence that elderberry is as effective or less effective than diclofenac in cytokine reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Elderberry may be a safe option for treating viral respiratory illness, and there is no evidence that it overstimulates the immune system.

The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","output":"Mental health consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain.

This study aims to construct a physicians OMS adoption willingness model based on the information-motivation-behavioral skill (IMB) theory, explore the determinants affecting adoption willingness and its influencing pathways, and evaluate the moderating effects of OMS use experience on willingness through multi-group analysis. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians in three public hospitals of Jiangsu province, China, from June to July 2020, using a multi-stage sampling method. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the valid data from 531 respondents. RESULTS: Physicians willingness to adopt OMS was at a moderate level, with an average score of 14.273.34 (range: 4C20). The behavior model for physicians OMS adoption willingness fitted well. Information (In), motivation (Mo), and behavioral skill (BS) explained 69% of the variance in adoption willingness (AW). Information could only exert completely indirect effect on willingness via behavioral skills (b = 0.202, 95% CI[0.122, 0.314]); motivation could both generate direct effect (=0.368, p < 0.001) and partial indirect effect on willingness via behavioral skills (b = 0.160, 95% CI[0.092, 0.248]); and behavioral skills had a positive effect on willingness (=0.424, p < 0.001). Furthermore, OMS use experience showed a significant moderating effect on the Mo  AW pathway, with inexperienced physicians willingness being significantly stronger influenced by motivation compared to experienced ones. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study revealed the role of IMB model in interpreting and predicting physicians willingness to adopt OMS and the moderating effect of uptake experience, providing practitioners with a theoretical foundation and intervention framework for supporting OMS development efforts.","output":"Assessing Determinants of Online Medical Services Adoption Willingness of General Hospital Physicians Using the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model: A Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trends in mass analyzer development are reviewed here with an emphasis on tandem mass spectrometers.

CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old male resident of a dormitory presented to our unit with acute vertigo and left-sided dysmetria. NIHSS was 2. The initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, middle cerebellar peduncle and hemipons. An extensive work-up for stroke etiologies was unremarkable. Despite having no fever, respiratory symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, he was isolated and screened for COVID-19 due to his epidemiologic risks, with multiple residents from his dormitory being recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Confirming our suspicion, his respiratory samples returned positive for COVID-19. His D-dimer levels returned normal. Thereafter, the patient underwent posterior decompression surgery due to worsening edema caused by the cerebellar infarct. He was started on antiplatelet therapy and recovered significantly a month from presentation with an modified Rankin Sore of 2. He remained without typical COVID-19 symptoms.

Differing from the normal situation where general concerns on travel time and cost determine the travel choices, the uncertainty underlying behavior change in the case of a pandemic might be largely attributed to the latent aspects, i.e., social responsibility, risk perception, attitudes, which could diminish the effects of main attributes on travel decisions. Therefore, this paper examines the effects of COVID-19 related policies on individuals' travel choices influenced by the latent aspects. A stated choice experiment was designed to collect people's responses under policy measures to various transportation modes. Results of a hybrid choice model show that COVID-19 related policies significantly affect individuals' transportation mode choice decisions during pandemic situations. The attributes, like travel time and travel cost, which significantly impact travel behavior in normal situations, become less relevant. Moreover, the travel preferences during the pandemic are significantly associated with latent factors of social responsibility, fear of infection, perceived risk, and travel anxiety. In general, public transportation is identified as an insecure alternative compared with other private modes, and people who are more socially responsible tend to travel less during the pandemic. Outcomes of this study could be of value to policymakers and public health emergencies, e.g., government authorities to utilize such knowledge in providing social support for these COVID-19 countermeasures and designing customized policies for specific population groups.","output":"Role of latent factors and public policies in travel decisions under COVID-19 pandemic: Findings of a hybrid choice model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital skills can be a valuable resource in work life, especially in such times as the current COVID-19 pandemic, during which working from home has become new reality. Although increasing numbers of older employees (aged 50 years and above) are using digital technologies to work remotely, many of these older adults still have generally lower digital skills. Whether the pandemic will be a push factor for the acquisition of computer skills in late working life remains unclear. This study investigated the explanatory factors of the computer skills gained by older workers who were working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, using representative data for 28 countries from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The analysis of the survey responses of 11,042 employed persons aged 50 years and older revealed that, 13% worked only at home due to the pandemic, while 15% said they worked at home and in their usual workplace. The descriptives indicate that full-time homeworking is more of an option among those with tertiary education and who already have some computer skills. Of the older employees who worked only at home, 36% reported an improvement in their computer skills, whereas of the older workers who worked at home and at their usual workplaces, only 29% reported such an improvement. Our results based on logistic regressions suggest that significantly more women, younger employees, respondents with tertiary educational qualifications, and those whose work was not affected by unemployment or even business closure acquired new computer skills, regardless of whether they were working permanently or only partly from home.

We aimed to delineate the evolution of CT findings and outcome in OP of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 106 COVID-19 patients with OP based on CT findings were retrospectively included and categorized into non-severe (mild/common) and severe (severe/critical) groups. CT features including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, linear opacities and total severity CT score were evaluated at three time intervals from symptom-onset to CT scan (day 0C7, day 8C14, day > 14). Discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU or death), and pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or lesion residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed based on the CT features at different time interval. RESULTS: 79 (74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103 (97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8C50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2C4 weeks after discharge, 20 (29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30C53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P = 0.010), number of involved lobe > 3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P = 0.030), CT score > 4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.010) at day 8C14. CONCLUSION: Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1C2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe > 3, and CT score > 4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT.","output":"Organizing pneumonia of COVID-19: Time-dependent evolution and outcome in CT findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present literature review is to describe the influence of sex hormones on the human voice in physiological conditions.

Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts studies showing that biobanked venous blood contains T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests a preformed T cell memory towards structural proteins in individuals not exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. Although beta-coronaviruses are the most likely candidates to explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with the highest similarity to those from beta-coronaviruses are confined to replication associated proteinsnot the host interacting S-protein.

We quantified the impact of different STEMI treatment strategies on patient outcomes and provider risk in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using a decision-analytic framework, we evaluated the effect of PPCI versus the pharmaco-invasive strategy for managing STEMI on 30-day patient mortality and individual provider infection risk based on presence of cardiogenic shock, suspected coronary territory, and presence of known or presumptive COVID-19 infection. RESULTS For patients with low suspicion for COVID-19, PPCI had mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy, and the risk of cardiac catheterization laboratory provider infection remained very low (<0.25%) across all subgroups. For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered substantial mortality benefit to patients relative to the pharmaco-invasive strategy (7.9% absolute decrease in 30-day mortality), but also greater risk of provider infection (2.3% absolute increase in risk of provider infection). For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with nonanterior STEMI without cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered a 0.4% absolute mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy with a 0.2% greater absolute risk of provider infection, and the tradeoff between patient and provider risk with PPCI became more apparent in sensitivity analysis with more severe COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSIONS Usual care with PPCI remains the appropriate treatment strategy in the majority of cases presenting with STEMI in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, utilization of a pharmaco-invasive strategy in selected patients with STEMI with presumptive COVID-19 and low likelihood of mortality from STEMI and use of preventive strategies such as preprocedural intubation in high risk patients when PPCI is the preferred strategy may be reasonable to reduce provider risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Patient and Provider Risk in Managing ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Decision Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Encephalitis is associated with significant neurological disability and mortality.

It is becoming increasingly clear that mesothelial cells that cover the peritoneal cavity are involved in ovarian cancer progression. Mesothelial cells are numerous in the peritoneal cavity and normally play many functions to maintain the peritoneal environment. In the tumor microenvironment, mesothelial cells that gain mesenchymal features and cooperate with ovarian cancer are called ovarian cancer-associated mesothelial cells, and they must help ovarian cancer cells to adhere to the peritoneum, invade, and disseminate. Elucidating and targeting these processes may improve the prognosis of ovarian cancer, which is difficult to cure. ABSTRACT: Ovarian cancer has one of the poorest prognoses among carcinomas. Advanced ovarian cancer often develops ascites and peritoneal dissemination, which is one of the poor prognostic factors. From the perspective of the seed and soil hypothesis, the intra-abdominal environment is like the soil for the growth of ovarian cancer (OvCa) and mesothelial cells (MCs) line the top layer of this soil. In recent years, various functions of MCs have been reported, including supporting cancer in the OvCa microenvironment. We refer to OvCa-associated MCs (OCAMs) as MCs that are stimulated by OvCa and contribute to its progression. OCAMs promote OvCa cell adhesion to the peritoneum, invasion, and metastasis. Elucidation of these functions may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can delay OvCa progression, which is difficult to cure.","output":"Ovarian Cancer-Associated Mesothelial Cells: Transdifferentiation to Minions of Cancer and Orchestrate Developing Peritoneal Dissemination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The purpose of the DEFINITIVE Ca(++) study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of directional atherectomy and distal embolic protection, used together to treat moderate to severely calcified femoropopliteal lesions. BACKGROUND Despite advances in endovascular treatment modalities, treatment of calcified lesions remains a challenge. METHODS A total of 133 subjects with 168 moderate to severely calcified lesions were enrolled. Lesions were treated with directional atherectomy devices, coupled with distal embolic protection. RESULTS The 30-day freedom from MAE rate was 93.1%. Per angiographic core laboratory assessment, the primary effectiveness endpoint (50% residual diameter stenosis) was achieved in 92.0% (lower confidence bound of 87.6%) of lesions. By core lab analysis, these results did not achieve the success criteria (90%) for the primary effectiveness objective. Per site assessment, the objective was met with the endpoint being achieved in 97.0% (lower confidence bound 93.8%). A mean residual diameter stenosis of 33.3% was achieved with the directional atherectomy device. This was further decreased to 24.1% with the use of adjunctive therapy.

Federated learning (FL), a paradigm that enables privacy-protected collaborative learning among different institutions, is a promising solution to this challenge. However, FL generally suffers from performance deterioration due to heterogeneous data distributions across institutions and the lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we present a robust and label-efficient self-supervised FL framework for medical image analysis. Specifically, we introduce a novel distributed self-supervised pre-training paradigm into the existing FL pipeline (i.e., pre-training the models directly on the decentralized target task datasets). Built upon the recent success of Vision Transformers, we employ masked image encoding tasks for self-supervised pre-training, to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer to downstream federated models. Extensive empirical results on simulated and real-world medical imaging federated datasets show that self-supervised pre-training largely benefits the robustness of federated models against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably, under severe data heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional pre-training data, achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test accuracy on retinal, dermatology and chest X-ray classification compared with the supervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. Moreover, we show that our self-supervised FL algorithm generalizes well to out-of-distribution data and learns federated models more effectively in limited label scenarios, surpassing the supervised baseline by 10.36% and the semi-supervised FL method by 8.3% in test accuracy.","output":"Label-Efficient Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Medical Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The notion that developing countries must wait for the developed world to make advances in science and technology that they later import at great cost is being challenged.

DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

Cases were identified both through symptom-triggered testing and a universal asymptomatic testing program. An online questionnaire was sent to all University of Cambridge students on 25 November to investigate risk factors for testing positive in the period after 30 October 2020. This asked about symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, in-person teaching settings, other aspects of University life, and attendance at social events in the period just prior to lockdown, from 30th October and 4th November 2020. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken evaluating potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results Among 3,980 students responding to the questionnaire, 99 (2.5%) reported testing SARS-CoV-2 positive in the period studied; 28 (28%) were asymptomatic. We found strong independent associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were attendance at two social settings in the City of Cambridge (adjusted odds ratio favouring disease 13.0 (95% CI 6.2,26.9) and 14.2 (95% CI 2.9,70)), with weaker evidence of association with three further social settings.

Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox(1). Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: DelphiCFacebook(2,3) (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse(4) (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, DelphiCFacebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14C20 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11C17 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an AxiosCIpsos online panel(5) with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices(6) provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework(1) to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10.

The quantification of antiviral responses demonstrates T cells' dominant role in the virus clearance relative to antibodies, especially for mild patients(96.5%). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory responses, namely cytokine inhibition rate and tissue repair rate also have positive correlations with T cell number, and are significantly suppressed in non-survivors. Simulations show that impaired immune functions of T cells leads to greater inflammation (thus dominates the death), explaining the monotonous increase of COVID-19 mortality with age and higher mortality for males. We conclude that T cells play the role of crucial immunity that saves the death from COVID-19, which points out a new direction to advance current prevention and treatment by incorporating the vaccines, drugs and health care activities that aim to improve T cells' number and functions.","output":"Impairment of T cells' antiviral and anti-inflammation immunities dominates the death from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus detection at the point-of-care facility has become an alarming topic in the research community.

INTRODUCTION: Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR-HB) models have been shown to be effective, however, there is a large variation of protocols and minimal evidence of effectiveness in higher risk populations, in which exercise at distance might be concerning. In addition, lack of reimbursement models has discouraged the widespread adoption of CR-HB. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an even greater gap in CR care has emerged due to the decreased availability of on-site services. PURPOSE: Evaluation of the safety of a CR-HB program during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Prospective cohort study which included patients (pts) who were participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB after the centre-based CR program closure due to COVID-19. The CR-HB consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including: 1.pts regular clinical and exercise risk assessment; 2.psychological tele-appointments and group sessions; 3. online exercise training sessions, which consisted of recorded videos and real time online exercise training sessions (each session recommended 3 times per week, during 60 minutes); 4.structured online educational program for pts and family members/caregivers, including educational videos and webinars; 5. follow-up fortnightly questionnaire to evaluate risk factors control and need for appointments or directing to hospital; 6. nutrition tele-appointments; 7. physician tele-appointments, scheduled according to follow-up questionnaire or at patients request (e-mail or telephone) to avoid unnecessary exposure and overload in the hospital. Minor and major adverse events such as hospitalizations due to cardiac event or other non CV reason, cardiac or noncardiac death, during or immediately after the exercise sessions, were collected. RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease (CVD) pts (62.6  8.9 years, 95 males) who were attending a Centre-based CR program were included in a CR-HB program. Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease; 13.8% pts had heart failure. The mean LVEF was 52  11%; 31,1% of the population had at least moderate risk. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most common risk factor (74.7%) followed by hypertension (59.6%), family history (41.8%), dyslipidaemia (37.9%), diabetes (18.1%), and smoking (12.9%). 98 CVD pts (85.5%) successfully completed all the online assessments. Three male participants dropped out for hospitalization due to knee surgery, pacemaker implantation and in-stent restenosis without relation to exercise sessions. No major events were registered during the exercise training sessions and only one minor adverse event, sprained ankle, was reported during the training sessions.

RESULTS The total stress scores were significantly higher among healthcare workers who were aged 41 or above, female, married, parents and nurses. Those with experience of treating SARS reported having significantly higher stress scores on the subscale measuring the discomfort caused by protective equipment and the workload of caring for patients. During the COVID-19 outbreak, frontline healthcare workers with experience of treating SARS indicated having higher stress levels regarding the workload of caring for patients than did non-frontline healthcare workers with no experience of treating SARS.

Relevant articles were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Three core themes were identified: there was no shared understanding of what constitutes student engagement with learning technologies, there was a lack of explanation concerning the contextual variation and modalities of student engagement across the digital technologies, and self-reporting was the primary method of measuring student engagement, rendering results as perceptual rather than behavioural. We argue that using multiple datasets and different methodological approaches can provide further insights into student engagement with digital technologies.

The resistance caused by mutations can be circumvented since the mutations that cause the loss of function also incapacitate the virus. Many pathogens encode proteases that are essential for their replication and that have a defined substrate specificity. A genetically encoded sensor composed of a fused membrane anchor, viral protease target site, and an orthogonal transcriptional activator was engineered into a human cell line. The HIV-1 protease released the transcriptional activator from the membrane, thereby inducing transcription of the selected genes. The device was still strongly activated by clinically relevant protease mutants that are resistant to protease inhibitors.

The present research aims to investigate the impact of divergent thinking strategies in developing reading comprehension skills among sixth-grade students in the English language. Methodology and research methods. The authors used the quasi-experimental approach. A pre-post design was used to identify the effect of employing divergent thinking strategies in developing reading comprehension skills. The study sample consisted of 136 students, who were selected purposefully and distributed into two groups: experimental and control groups. Students in experimental group were taught using divergent thinking strategies. Students in control group were taught in the usual way. Results and scientific novelty. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found statistically significant differences between the two groups in favour of the experimental group in achievement. In addition, significant differences were found in the Motivation for Learning English between the two groups. It was found that divergent thinking strategies stimulate students' thinking through various questions and allow them to look at their familiar knowledge with a new vision, to produce and generate new ideas with creative features. Practical significance. The current study is useful in determining the appropriate reading comprehension skills for students, and targeting them in developing these skills. This research also draws the attention of teachers to the importance of including strategies compatible with the brain, including divergent thinking strategies, when planning reading lessons.

While it has been proven that pharmacist interventions improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), the economic impact of these initiatives is uncertain. Consequently, we aim to systematically review and synthesize the evidence surrounding the economic impact of pharmacist care in PLWHA. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, IPA via ProQuest, the Cochrane Library, and the CINAHL Plus databases were systematically searched. Original studies evaluating the economic effect of pharmacist-managed services for PLWHA were included in the review. The quality of the economic studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS) checklist. RESULTS: A search of databases yielded 4206 citations, four of which met the eligibility criteria. Three studies were conducted in a hospital-based outpatient facility, while one study was conducted in a community pharmacy setting. The types of pharmacist-managed services included targeted motivational education, pharmaceutical care, health screening for opportunistic infections, and referral to specialists. Two of the four economic evaluation studies had complete economic analyses and were rated as moderate in quality. In comparison with usual care, pharmacist services led to cost savings of (51.29 to 165.74 in 2021 USD$) per person per year, saving 18.5 h per patient per year, and a lower cost of generating 12 years of quality-adjusted life years.

We develop and test the hypothesis that when populations endogenously respond to risk this tradeoff disappears. Methods- We develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries constituting 7.05 billion people and assess the existence of a tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods. Results- We show that with endogenous responses communities go through three phases: rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation (r = -0.241, p = 0.009) between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries (5-95 percentile: 0.521-0.867 of pre-pandemic contacts), expected death rates vary greatly, by over two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day). Interpretation- Whether by choice or by the force of crippling death tolls, most societies will bring down interactions enough to contain SARS-CoV-2s spread.

Surveillance of the severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Brazil aims to characterize the circulation of the Influenza A and B viruses in hospitalized cases and deaths, having been expanded in 2012 to include other respiratory viruses COVID-19 was detected in Brazil for the time in the 9th epidemiological week of 2020, and the test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was included in the surveillance protocol starting in the 12th epidemiological week This study&#039;s objective was to investigate the pattern of hospitalizations for SAR in Brazil since the entry of SARS-CoV-2, comparing the temporal and age profiles and laboratory results to the years 2010 through 2019 In 2020, hospitalizations for SARI, compiled from the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 up to the 12th week, exceeded the numbers observed during the same period in each of the previous 10 years The age bracket over 60 years was the most heavily affected, at higher than historical levels There was a considerable increase in negative laboratory tests, suggesting circulation of a different virus from those already present in the panel We concluded that the increase in hospitalizations for SARI, the lack of specific information on the etiological agent, and the predominance of cases among the elderly during the same period in which there was an increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 are all consistent with the hypothesis that severe cases of COVID-19 are already being detected by SARI surveillance, placing an overload on the health system The inclusion of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the SARI surveillance protocol and the test&#039;s effective nationwide deployment are extremely important for monitoring the evolution of severe COVID-19 cases in Brazil","output":"COVID-19 e

Analytical specificity (ASp) of this new RT-LAMP assay was 100% and analytical sensitivity (ASe) was between 1a?a?101 and 1a?a?102 copies per reaction when using a synthetic DNA target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of RNA RT-LAMP was 97% and 99% respectively, relative to the standard of care rRT-PCR. When a CT cut-off of 33 was employed, above which increasingly evidence suggests there is a low risk of patients shedding infectious virus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100%. The DSe and DSp of Direct RT-LAMP (that does not require RNA extraction) was 67% and 97%, respectively. When setting CT cut-offs of &#8804;33 and &#8804;25, the DSe increased to 75% and 100%, respectively, time from swab-to-result, CT < 25, was < 15 minutes.

CTC-NSMs were formulated via thin-film hydration method, optimized using D-optimal design, and characterized for entrapment efficiency, vesicle size, drug release, and cumulative amount permeated. The entrapment efficiency ranged from 19.44 to 61.98% with sustained drug release, and the vesicle size ranged from 125.4 to 542.5 nm with enhanced drug permeation. Cholesterol: Span ratio of 1:1.19 and cholesterol amount of 20 mg were predicted to produce optimal characteristics. Subsequently, the optimized formulation permeation confirmed a high nasal penetration using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Afterward, the optimized CTC-NSM formulation was integrated into in situ gel to boost the residence time in the nasal cavity. Additionally, Computed Tomography (CT) was performed by labeling the optimized formulation with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to assess brain uptake and cellular translocation after intranasal administration of CTC. Furthermore, the protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced generalized seizures and mortality were determined in rats and compared with the oral drug solution at the exact dosage. The in vivo results revealed that a low dose of CTC-NSM in situ gel had a powerful protective effect with delayed the latency for the start of convulsions.

The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis.

Rapid screening is of great significance to control the spread of disease. In the clinic practice, computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized by the doctors to detect and evaluate novel coronavirus pneumonia and lung segmentation is a necessary initial step for lung image analysis. However, the segmentation task is still confronted with several challenges, such as high variations in intensity, indistinct edges and noise due to data acquisition process. To address aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we present a novel two-stage-based COVID-19 lung segmentation method. First, we design a coarse segmentation method combining threshold and rib outline, which can remove most background while retaining complete lung shapes. Then, a contour refinement algorithm was introduced to refine the coarse segmentation based on local information including intensity, shape and gradient. The proposed method was tested on 20 sets of COVID-19 CT cases. Quantitative evaluations are conducted with different methods (including the deep learning-based approach), and the results demonstrate that our method can provide superior performance with few-shot samples. Our method achieves an average symmetric surface distance (ASD) of 0.0101  0.0147 mm and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 99.22  0.99 % on lung CT image segmentation compared with ground truths.

In recent years, researchers have started relying more on photo-based, geotagged social data, which offer insights about tourists, popular hotspots, and mobility patterns. However, distinguishing between tourists and locals from this data is problematic since residence information is often not provided. While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users geotagged photos taken in Tokyos 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied.

Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19. METHODS: We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. RESULTS: In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).

SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wild-type laboratory mice owing to inefficient interactions between the viral spike protein and the mouse orthologue of the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4.

Wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has proven an effective and efficient technique to approximate COVID-19 case rates in the population. Predicting variant abundances from wastewater, however, is technically challenging. Here we show that by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and applying computational techniques initially used for RNA-Seq quantification, we can estimate the abundance of variants in wastewater samples. We show by sequencing samples from wastewater and clinical isolates in Connecticut U.S.A. between January and April 2021 that the temporal dynamics of variant strains broadly correspond. We further show that this technique can be used with other wastewater sequencing techniques by expanding to samples taken across the United States in a similar timeframe. We find high variability in signal among individual samples, and limited ability to detect the presence of variants with clinical frequencies <10%; nevertheless, the overall trends match what we observed from sequencing clinical samples. Thus, while clinical sequencing remains a more sensitive technique for population surveillance, wastewater sequencing can be used to monitor trends in variant prevalence in situations where clinical sequencing is unavailable or impractical.","output":"Variant abundance estimation for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using RNA-Seq quantification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease it causes in late 2019 and early 2020 has since led to a global pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The pandemic is a steadily growing social, economic, psychological, and health burden. The infection rates worldwide are climbing. COVID-19 is considered a systemic disease, potentially resulting in acute respiratory distress and cardiovascular failure leading to death. Yet, SARS-CoV-2, a novel and still under-studied virus, has been documented to cause a large variety of symptoms, in many cases including cutaneous manifestations. This paper is a review of medical literature available to date regarding the cutaneous manifestations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is also aimed at discussing the significance of dermatological findings for improved diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Considering the gravity of the novel coronavirus pandemic, an improved dermatological approach would aid timely diagnosis and effective management of COVID-19, and would facilitate classification of the cutaneous abnormalities observed.","output":"Cutaneous manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Stay-at-home orders and social distancing recommendations, combined with COVID-19 concerns, have caused significant disruptions in daily life. Throughout the pandemic, vulnerable populations, commonly seen within the University of Iowa emergency department, have been more negatively affected by COVID-19. Study Objectives: To assess how the social needs of the population cared for within the University of Iowa emergency department have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid and Services (CMS) social risk assessment was adapted, covering 13 specific domains, to assess changes to participants social situations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic dated from January 2020 to February 2021. It was administered within the emergency department to individuals selected by a convenience sample who were stable enough to complete the form. Frequencies with percentages, fishers exact test, logistic regression were used to analyze the categorical data. Dependent variables of interest were analyzed by age group, sex, and race. Results: A total of 305 patients were approached and 207 (68%) responses were received. Of the included responses 7/177 (4%) identified as Hispanic or Latino, 15/175 (8.6%) as Black or African American, and 151/175 (86.3%) as white. The survey respondents indicated that 7.1% had worsened employment situation in comparison to before COVID-19. Moreover, 14.5% found it harder to pay for basics such as food, housing, medical care, and heating compared to prior to the pandemic, and 10.1% reported worsening lack of reliable transportation. Further, 26% stated that feelings of loneliness have worsened along with 30% reporting more stress, while 16.8% reported feelings of little interest or pleasure in doing things have improved along with 20.8% reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless also improved in comparison to before the pandemic. Lastly, 2.5% stated their physical safety had worsened and 6.5% were experiencing worsening verbal abuse. The logistic regression showed that the odds ratio (95% CI) for increased financial difficulty for Non-Caucasians vs Caucasians is 10.5 (2.7 -40.3) and the odds ratio (95% CI) for increased financial difficulty for females vs males is 2.9 (1.1 C 7.7). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to overall greater financial instability and increased stress. Non-Caucasians and females were more likely to report that their financial situations worsened. Isolation, stress, and forms of abuse were also found to worsen. Nevertheless, symptoms of worsening depression were found to be improve among our study population. In light of these findings, it is important to understand how the pandemic affected numerous social determinants of health, especially for individuals who were already experiencing unmet social needs. With a better understanding of the health needs of our population, identifying strategies to improve overall wellness can be better achieved.","output":"63 The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Social Determinants of Health on Patients in a Rural Academic Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To examine the ability of fabrics which might be used to create homemade face masks to filter out ultrafine (smaller than 1m in diameter) particles.

Pediatric referral centers located within institutions providing ECMO to adult patients with severe COVID-19 may benefit from frequent and direct communication with their adult and regional colleagues to devise a collaborative plan for safe and timely provision of ECMO to patients with MIS-C as the ongoing pandemic continues to consume this limited, lifesaving resource.","output":"Operational Innovation in the Provision of Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesThis is an update of a previous report that examined literature published up to March 11th, 2021. Sixteen additional studies have been included in this update. The objective of this report is to identify comparative observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing forward transmission from vaccinated people, and studies examining the biological plausibility of vaccination-induced transmission reduction. MethodA search of databases, MEDLINE, Embase, L-OVE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted to identify RCTs or comparative observational studies evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in the prevention of transmission, asymptomatic infections and transmissibility of COVID-19 among vaccinated persons. An additional search of grey literature was conducted. This search is current to May 4th, 2021. ResultsIn this update, 16 additional studies, including 9 human and 7 animal studies, were included. Therefore, this review examines a total of 33 included studies: 21 human studies and 12 preclinical animal studies. Evidence from two large household surveillance studies from the UK suggests that a single or full dose of AstraZeneca (AZ) and Pfizer-BioNtech (PfBnT) vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination by up to 54%. The AZ vaccine trials in the general population suggest that an initial low dose followed by a standard dose may provide up to 59% protection against asymptomatic or unknown infection, although efficacy against these outcomes was not demonstrated following two standard doses. PfBnT vaccine observational studies in the general population suggest up to 90% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection after seven or more days of full dose vaccination. Up to 75% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was reported after full- dose in healthcare workers. Across RCTs examining asymptomatic infection in the general population, one dose of Moderna was shown to provide an efficacy of 61.4% against asymptomatic infection 21 days after the first dose; in another trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy of 74% 28 days after the first dose. Lastly, seven of eight studies found significantly increased cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load, in PfBnT or AZ vaccinated individuals compared with those who were unvaccinated. ConclusionThe AZ and PfBnT vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination. More studies have found the vaccines to significantly reduce the risk of asymptomatic infection and significantly increase cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: The scoping review aimed to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and datasets used for their development and validation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (i.e., AI) and the target disease (i.e., COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing, and assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts/reservoirs. Researchers utilized AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and length of hospital stay. AI was used for Infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI techniques used were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM). CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19.

However, standard care for patients with T2D is the central role of the general practice physician, and consists of routine appointments to monitor glycaemic status and overall health. Dietary modification is an essential component of T2D management. Evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) provides better clinical outcomes for people with T2D compared with other diets. However, providing dietary support in face-to-face settings is challenged by issues of availability and accessibility. Provided in conjunction with standard care, digital interventions can help bridge this gap. The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a web-based intervention that will evaluate the effectiveness of standard care plus web-based LCD intervention when compared with standard care only. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two-arm parallel RCT, 100 adults with non-insulin-dependent T2D aged between 40 and 89 years will be randomised to either a theoretically informed 16-week automated web-based LCD intervention plus standard care or standard care only. LCD recommendations emphasise consuming nutrient-dense whole foods and encourage a daily carbohydrate goal of 50C100 g, with an objective of achieving 10% to <26% carbohydrates from total energy intake. Assessments will take place at baseline and 16 weeks. The primary outcome will be haemoglobin A1c. Additional data collected will include dietary intake, self-efficacy, weight and height, anti-diabetes medication and dosages, and diabetes-related comorbidities.

The aim of this study was to determine the complications, satisfaction, and revision rates associated with spreader grafts and spreader flaps and to compare these two modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting this systematic review. The authors searched the literature systematically for pertinent materials in PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria of this search included: randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, cohorts, and case series with more than 5 participants on rhinoplasty using spreader grafts or spreader flaps with detailed report either on complications, revision, and satisfaction rates. Furthermore, exclusion criteria included: any cadaveric or non-human study, case reports, technical notes, and review articles. RESULTS: The initial literature search yielded a total of 193 studies. Following screening each paper and implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 articles were chosen. In the spreader graft group, from 21 studies reporting complications, 6 of them reported no complication. The most common complications were nasal obstruction, inverted V deformity and open roof deformity, deviation, and infection. In the spreader flap group, from 6 studies reporting any existing complications, 1 reported no complications. Five other studies reported some degree of complications. In terms of revision rate, 10 patients (0.62%) underwent revision surgery after spreader graft placement, while only 2 patients (0.35%) revised surgically in the spreader flap group. CONCLUSION: These two methods seem to have no significant difference in terms of complication rates, and both are recommended as a choice in middle vault reconstruction when each of their clinical use is indicated.

Although used as the standard method to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time PCR has challenges in dealing with asymptomatic patients and those with an undetectable viral load. Serological tests are therefore considered potent diagnostic tools to complement real-time PCR-based diagnosis and are used for surveillance of seroprevalence in populations. However, the dynamics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 currently remain to be investigated. Here, through analysis of plasma samples from 84 patients with COVID-19, we observed that the response of virus-specific antibodies against three important antigens, RBD, N and S, dynamically changed over time and reached a peak 5-8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The antibody responses were irrespective of sex. Severe cases were found to have higher levels of antibody response, larger numbers of inflammatory cells and C-reactive protein levels. Within the mild/moderate cases, pairwise comparison indicated moderate association between anti-RBD vs. anti-N, anti-RBD vs. anti-S1S2, and anti-N vs. anti-S1S2. Furthermore, the majority of cases could achieve IgM and IgG seroconversion at 2 weeks since the disease onset. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies indicated that these responses were able to last for more than 112 days but decline significantly after the peak.

Despite its relevance for human health, many aspects of HDL-mediated lipid trafficking and cellular signaling remain elusive at the molecular level. During HDLs journey throughout the body, its function is mediated through interactions with cell surface receptors on different cell types. Using four different cellular model systems HDL is interacting with, we comparatively analyzed their surfaceomes to define the HDL receptome. Surfaceome analysis of EA.hy926, HEPG2, foam cells, and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) revealed the main currently known HDL-receptor scavenger receptor B1 (SCRB1), as well as 154 shared cell surface receptors representing potential HDL interaction receptor candidates. Since vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was recently found as a regulatory factor of transendothelial transport of HDL, we next analyzed the VEGF modulated surfaceome of HAEC using auto-CSC technology. VEGF-A treatment led to a remodeling of the surfaceome of HAEC cells including the previously reported higher surfaceome abundance of SCRB1 upon treatment. 165 additional receptors were found on HAEC upon VEGF-A treatment representing SCRB1 co-regulated receptors potentially involved in HDL function. Using HATRIC-based ligand receptor capturing (HATRIC-LRC) technology on human endothelial cells, we specifically aimed for the identification of other bona fide (co-)receptors of HDL beyond SCRB1. HATRIC-LRC enabled, next to SCRB1, the identification of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK), which we show is directly contributing to endothelial HDL binding and uptake.

Herein, we investigated the role of LUS imaging in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and the relationship between LUS findings and disease severity. This was a retrospective, observational study at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, on 48 recruited patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including 32 non-critically ill patients and 16 critically ill patients. LUS was performed and the respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) index, disease severity, and confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age (CURB-65) score were recorded on days 0C7, 8C14, and 15C21 after symptom onset. Lung images were divided into 12 regions, and the LUS score (0C36 points) was calculated. Chest computed tomography (CT) scores (0C20 points) were also recorded on days 0C7. Correlations between the LUS score, ROX index, and CURB-65 scores were examined. LUS detected COVID-19 pneumonia in 38 patients. LUS signs included B line (34/38, 89.5%), consolidation (6/38, 15.8%), and pleural effusion (2/41, 5.3%). Most cases showed more than one lesion (32/38, 84.2%) and involved both lungs (28/38, 73.7%). Compared with non-critically ill patients, the LUS scores of critically ill patients were higher (12 (10C18) vs 2 (0C5), p < 0.001). The LUS score showed significant negative correlations with the ROX index on days 0C7 (r = C0.85, p < 0.001), days 8C14 (r = C0.71, p < 0.001), and days 15C21 (r = C0.76, p < 0.001) after symptom onset. However, the LUS score was positively correlated with the CT score (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). The number of patients with LUS-detected lesions decreased from 27 cases (81.8%) to 20 cases (46.5%), and the LUS scores significantly decreased from 4 (2C10) to 0 (0C5) (p < 0.001) from days 0C7 to 17C21. We conclude that LUS can detect lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in a portable, real-time, and safe manner.

Treating heart failure necessitates prescribing of multiple medications, in-line with national and international guidelines predisposing patients to polypharmacy. This review aims to identify how polypharmacy has been defined among heart failure patients in the literature, whether a standard definition in relation to heart failure could be identified and to describe the prevalence. The Healthcare Database Advanced Search (HDAS) was used to search EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cinahl and PsychInfo from inception until March 2021. Articles were included of any design, in patients  18 years old, with a diagnosis of heart failure; that explicitly define and measure polypharmacy. Data were thereafter extracted and described using a narrative synthesis approach. A total of 7522 articles were identified with 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. No standard definition of polypharmacy was identified. The most common definition was that of   5 medications. Polypharmacy prevalence was high in heart failure populations, ranging from 17.2 to 99%. Missing or heterogeneous methods for defining heart failure and poor patient cohort characterisation limited the impact of most studies. Polypharmacy, most commonly defined as  5 medications, is highly prevalent in the heart failure population. There is a need for an internationally agreed definition of polypharmacy, allowing accurate review of polypharmacy issues. Whether an arbitrary numerical cut-off is a suitable definition, rather than medication appropriateness, remains unclear. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between polypharmacy with specific types of heart failure and related comorbidities.

Soon after the epidemic was first detected in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China, starting in late December 2019, the virus spread over multiple countries in different continents, being declared a pandemic by March 2020. The demographic characteristics of the infected patients suggest that age, sex, and comorbidities are predictive factors for the fatality of the infection. The mechanisms of viral entry into the human host cells seem to be in a close relationship with the mechanisms of regulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which may explain the pathogenesis associated with the infection. This brings new insights into the possibilities of exploiting viral entry mechanisms to limit associated complications by means of enhancing the resistance of the infected patients using methods of regulating the RAS and strategies of modulating ACE2 expression. In this perspective article we exploit the mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis based on the demographic characteristics of the infected patients reported in the recent literature and explore several approaches of limiting the initial steps of viral entry and pathogenesis based on viral interactions with ACE2 and RAS.

In addition, they display multiple immune-modulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinflammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. These immune modulations result from upregulation or downregulation of the relevant genes and their transcription factors.

As part of the process evaluation of a pragmatic trial of video visits in HBPC, we assessed clinician experience with video visit implementation. Methods: We assessed clinicians' experiences with and perception of the usefulness and appropriateness of video visits using anonymous surveys and brief qualitative interviews with a subset of survey participants. Qualitative analyses were guided by sociotechnical frameworks that emphasize technology's value proposition for its end users as being key to adoption. Results: Clinicians (36 physicians and 48 registered nurses) generally had favorable attitudes toward video visits and telehealth. Respondents felt confident in the skills needed to make their role in video visits successful. Clinicians were neutral on whether video visits were useful for their practice or enhanced the patientCcaregiver experience. Clinicians found video visits to be most appropriate for follow-up care (as opposed to start of care). The interviews yielded two themes that complemented the survey findings: (1) factors enhancing the value proposition (positive responses from patients and families and convenience) and (2) factors diminishing the value proposition (issues related to the technology and scheduling).

Between 2012 and 2018, a total of 10,886 IFDs were recorded. The incidence increased slightly over time (2.16 to 2.36/10,000 hospitalization days, P = 0.0562) in relation with an increase of fungemia incidence (1.03 to 1.19/10,000, P = 0.0023), while that of other IFDs remained stable. The proportion of 65-year-old patients increased from 38.4% to 45.3% (P < 0.0001). Yeast fungemia (n = 5,444) was due mainly to Candida albicans (55.6%) with stable proportions of species over time. Echinocandins became the main drug prescribed (46.7% to 61.8%), but global mortality rate remained unchanged (36.3% at 1 month). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (n = 2,106) was diagnosed mostly in HIV-negative patients (80.7%) with a significantly higher mortality than in HIV-positive patients (21.9% versus 5.4% at 1 month, P < 0.0001). Invasive aspergillosis (n = 1,661) and mucormycosis (n = 314) were diagnosed mostly in hematology (>60% of the cases) with a global mortality rate of 42.5% and 59.3%, respectively, at 3 months and significant changes in diagnosis procedure over time. More concurrent infections were also diagnosed over time (from 5.4% to 9.4% for mold IFDs, P = 0.0115). In conclusion, we observed an aging of patients with IFD with a significant increase in incidence only for yeast fungemia, a trend toward more concurrent infections, which raises diagnostic and therapeutic issues. Overall, global survival associated with IFDs has not improved despite updated guidelines and new diagnostic tools. IMPORTANCE The epidemiology of invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) is hard to delineate given the difficulties in ascertaining the diagnosis that is often based on the confrontation of clinical and microbiological criteria. The present report underlines the interest of active surveillance involving mycologists and clinicians to describe the global incidence and that of the main IFDs. Globally, although the incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and mucormycosis remained stable over the study period (2012 to 2018), that of yeast fungemia increased slightly. We also show here that IFDs seem to affect older people more frequently. The most worrisome observation is the lack of improvement in the global survival rate associated with IFDs despite the increasing use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, the availability of new antifungal drugs very active in clinical trials, and a still low/marginal rate of acquired in vitro resistance in France. Therefore, other tracks of improvement should be investigated actively.","output":"Active Surveillance Program to Increase Awareness on Invasive Fungal Diseases: the French RESSIF Network (2012 to 2018)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From viruses to bacteria, our lives are filled with exposure to germs.

This article describes a hospital-based transport team's experience with interfacility transport of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of transports for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 was performed. All transports were performed by a single critical care transport team. The team was already trained in advanced mechanical ventilation, blood gas interpretation, and management of shock. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was followed regarding the use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled.

The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 10 (SDa?=a?4) and 24 (SDa?=a?7), respectively. The average transport distance and time were 18 miles (SDa?=a?9 miles) and 25 minutes (SDa?=a?11 minutes), respectively. Nineteen patients were intubated, 9 of whom required advanced ventilation. Two patients were transported prone. One patient experienced unintentional extubation upon transfer from the stretcher to the destination facility bed. The patient was reintubated without event.

This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the views of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey between 29th of May and 22nd of June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat or tossing a coin to decide. RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritised patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72%C93%), longer life expectancy (78%C83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88%C94%), were younger (71%C79%) or had a lesser degree of frailty (60%C69%, all p<0.001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58%C86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children.

Two reviewers screened and reviewed eligible studies in three stages: duplicates identification and elimination, title and abstract screening, and full-text assessment. Data was charted and results were classified into conceptual categories. Analysis was done in three stages: open descriptive coding, focused thematic analysis, and frequency, commonality and significance analysis. Results: forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Areas of research were grouped into seven themes: human rights and inequities, solidarity, collaboration and partnership, GHG structure change, political and economic power and finance, approaches to address inequity, law and regulations, and private investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in GHG. The highest number of papers were in the first theme, human rights and inequities. However, the themes are interrelated.

CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a previously healthy 83-year-old woman with COVID-19, without any genetic predisposition to thrombosis. She developed moderate respiratory distress 12 days after symptom onset and a 10-day course of dexamethasone therapy was initiated. Her clinical condition and imaging findings improved initially; however, they deteriorated after the completion of dexamethasone therapy, despite the improvement in her pneumonia and viral clearance. Laboratory tests showed markedly raised serum D-dimer, ferritin, and sIL-2R levels, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left iliac vein and PE of the right pulmonary artery. The DVT and PE were successfully treated using intravenous heparin administration. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the potential risk of rebound inflammation and procoagulant events following dexamethasone withdrawal. We believe that COVID-19-induced DVT and PE can be affected by dexamethasone therapy. Although dexamethasone reduces procoagulant factors, increases anticoagulant factors, and modulates cytokines, which can suppress/delay thrombus formation during treatment, it confers the risk for rebound cytokine production after treatment completion, triggering cytokine and coagulation cascades that can lead to thromboembolic diseases. In this critical clinical period, the patients deteriorating condition may be overlooked because of the masking effects of dexamethasone treatment on fever and other clinical conditions and laboratory changes. Clinicians should follow-up coagulation markers carefully and contrast-enhanced computed tomography is useful for detecting coagulation; and, if PE occurs, therapeutic heparin administration is essential because emboli can also generate cytokines.","output":"Pulmonary embolism after dexamethasone treatment for COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

There is certainly no doubt that genetic differences impact on the risk of developing or dying from infection. Obvious but rare examples include selective immunoglobulin deficiencies, complement deficiencies, and neutrophil function abnormalities. Genetic factors may also be protective, such as with sickle cell trait and malaria or mutations conferring resistance to human immunodeficiency virus infection. Much more subtle differences in immune responses are now being described, usually as the result of one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a gene. Rather than causing the failure of production of a protein or the production of a nonfunctional protein, SNPs are usually associated with changes in the rate of transcription, producing a much less severe phenotype than the classical examples of genetic defects mentioned above. It is now being appreciated that for many complex diseases, such as sepsis, the ultimate phenotype is the result of the interaction of genetic differences across many loci, not the dominant effect of a few key mutations. As seen in Fig. 3.1, since the mid 1990s, an increasing body of literature has focused on the role that gene polymorphisms in key inflammatory genes play in sepsis. Indeed, with advances in knowledge of the human genome, greater understanding of the inflammatory response, and the development of high throughput genotyping technologies, so many genetic associations have been described that discussion of each one is well beyond the scope of this chapter.

Experiment 1 used an associative encoding orienting task, and DF impairment was observed only when the forget targets were paired with forget lures within the test display; however, DF was eliminated when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, possibly due to a recall-to-reject strategy. Experiment 2 used an object-focused orienting task that downplayed the encoding of associative information. The results revealed the opposite of Experiment 1, with significant DF when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, and no DF when the lures and the target came from the same memory instruction. Experiment 3 used the same orienting task as Experiment 1, but testing used a sequential procedure, where item recognition was assessed first, followed by associative recognition test.

Our results show that IF3 accommodates its domains at velocities ranging over two orders of magnitude, responding to the binding of each 30S ligand. IF1 and IF2 promote IF3 compaction and the movement of the C-terminal domain (IF3C) towards the P site. Concomitantly, the N-terminal domain (IF3N) creates a pocket ready to accept the initiator tRNA. Selection of the initiator tRNA is accompanied by a transient accommodation of IF3N towards the 30S platform. Decoding of the mRNA start codon displaces IF3C away from the P site and rate limits translation initiation. 70S initiation complex formation brings IF3 domains in close proximity to each other prior to dissociation and recycling of the factor for a new round of translation initiation.

All lesions were confirmed after birth by computed tomography scan. Patient age at operation ranged from 4 days to 11 months and patient weight from 3.1 to 10 kg. RESULTS Seventy-four of 75 lobectomies were thoracoscopically completed. There were 16 upper lobectomies, 1 middle lobectomy, and 55 lower lobectomies. Operative time ranged from 45 to 225 minutes. Hospital length of stay ranged from 1 to 5 days. A subset of 26 patients had surgery younger than 3 months of age and <5 kg, despite being asymptomatic. Their operative time averaged 90 minutes, and mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lobectomy is safe for infants <10 kg and avoids the morbidity associated with thoracotomy. Operating early on younger patients may avoid the inflammatory changes associated with both clinically apparent and subclinical infections, even in patients weighing <5 kg. This may make the procedures less technically challenging and may result in lower complication and conversion rates.","output":"Thoracoscopic lobectomy in infants less than 10 kg with prenatally diagnosed cystic lung disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the critical context of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are on the front line, participating directly in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. This exposes them to a higher risk of developing chronic stress, psychological distress, and any other mental health symptoms. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate stress and burnout in a health workers population and, in addition, to measure hair cortisol concentration as a current biomarker of stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 health workers from Hospital de Clnicas \\"Jos de San Martn\\", Buenos Aires University, were included in this study. In this population hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible and the individuals completed the following surveys: perceived stress, social support, burnout scale, life event scale, and sociodemographic data. Hair cortisol was measured by an automated chemiluminescent method. The studied population was divided into three groups considering those individuals below the healthy reference sample range (< 40 pg/mg hair), within the healthy reference range (40-128 pg/mg hair) and above the reference range (> 128 pg/mg hair). This study used a transversal and observational design. RESULTS: Our results show that 40% of the studied population presented hair cortisol values outside of the healthy reference range. In the whole studied population, a direct correlation was found between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as between hair cortisol concentration and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout (r = 0.142, p = 0.030; r = 0.143, p = 0.029, respectively). 12% of the studied population showed Burnout (52% doctors and residents, 19% nurses, 19% administrative personnel). Higher values in hair cortisol levels were found in the group with burnout versus individuals without burnout (p = 0.034). Finally, a mediation analysis was performed, finding that depersonalization is a mediating variable in the relationship between self-perceived stress and hair cortisol level (F = 4.86, p = 0.0086; indirect effect IC: 0.0987-1.8840). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which a stress biomarker such as hair cortisol is evaluated in this population and in this context. Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency.","output":"Evaluation of stress, burnout and hair cortisol levels in health workers at a University Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chyloretroperitoneum is a rare complication of urological surgery.

The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p < 0.001) and D7 (p < 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICU-acquired infections and 28-day death.

Variations in the metabolic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the striking differences in the susceptibility to infection and the risk of severe disease. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine novel metabolic pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical severity using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CE-TOF-MS) in plasma samples. We included 27 patients with confirmed COVID-19 early after symptom onset who were prospectively followed and 29 healthcare workers heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but with low susceptibility to infection ( nonsusceptible). We found that the metabolite profile was predictive of the study group. We identified a total of 55 metabolites as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 clinical severity. We report the discovery of new plasma biomarkers for COVID-19 that provide mechanistic explanations for the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including mitochondrial and liver dysfunction as a consequence of hypoxemia (citrulline, citrate, and BAIBA), energy production and amino acid catabolism (L-glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid and L-histidine), endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (citrulline, L-ADMA, 2-AB, and Neu5Ac), and we found interconnections between these pathways. In summary, in this first report of the metabolomic profile of individuals with severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility by CE-MS, we define several metabolic pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical progression that could be developed as biomarkers of COVID-19.","output":"Metabolic snapshot of plasma samples reveals new pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has made it apparent that many people are unwilling to be vaccinated, and certain types of people seem predisposed to support or oppose vaccines.

Our results show that conscientiousness, extraversion, narcissism, psychopathy, and PsyCap each influence our outcomes via dimensions of vaccine hesitancy. PsyCap had an additional direct effect beyond these mediators. The overall effects of extraversion and PsyCap were negative on vaccine hesitancy, positive on pro-vaccination outcomes, and negative on anti-vaccination outcomes. The overall effects of conscientiousness, narcissism, and psychopathy were positive on vaccine hesitancy, negative on pro-vaccination outcomes, and positive on anti-vaccination outcomes. To conclude, we identify theoretical frameworks that can provide further insights into these relations.

The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA  EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5 position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein. Author Summary The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, has become one of the greatest threats to human health. While rapid progress has been made in the development of vaccines, drug discovery has lagged, partly due to the lack of atomic-resolution structures of the free and drug-bound forms of the viral proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, with its multiple activities that contribute to viral replication, is widely regarded as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. As structural information is essential for drug discovery, we established an efficient sample preparation system for biochemical and structural studies of intact full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein and characterized its structure and dynamics. We also characterized the interactions of amilorides with specific E protein residues and correlated this with their antiviral activity during viral replication. The binding affinity of the amilorides to E protein correlated with their antiviral potency, suggesting that E protein is indeed the likely target of their antiviral activity. We found that residue asparagine15 plays an important role in maintaining the conformation of the amiloride binding site, providing molecular guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting E protein.","output":"Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with amilorides correlate with antiviral activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges and has changed society;some of these changes seem temporary, and others seem permanent The uncertainty of the duration of this pandemic has introduced changes without the knowledge of how permanent they are, and has raised awareness regarding a need for a shift to a new normal This new normal will affect different aspects of our life routines and activities, such as travel behaviour, personal hygiene, socializing, and our working environment In the wake of the global pandemic, which has been followed by lockdowns, curfews, social distancing, and working from home, the future of the office has turned into an open question, as COVID has changed our expectation of how, where, and when people can do their jobs Big companies like Twitter and Facebook have announced that they are allowing employees to permanently work from home;however, some industry leaders are using the work-from-home experience to reimagine the role of the office in the future What will the future office look like, and what can we expect of the workplace environment?

We aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy informed vestibular rehabilitation (INVEST intervention) designed for persistent dizziness. METHODS: A two-armed parallel groups randomised feasibility study of INVEST vs. a time-matched gold standard vestibular rehabilitation (VRT) control. Participants with PPPD were recruited from a specialist vestibular clinic in London, UK. Participants were individually randomised using a minimisation procedure with allocation concealment. Measures of feasibility and clinical outcome were collected and assessed at 4 months. RESULTS: Forty adults with PPPD were randomised to six sessions of INVEST (n = 20) or gold standard VRT (n = 20). Overall, 59% of patients screened met the inclusion criteria, of which 80% enrolled. Acceptability of INVEST, as assessed against the theoretical framework of acceptability (TFA), was excellent and 80% adhered to all 6 sessions. There were small to moderate treatment effects in favour of INVEST across all measures, including dizziness handicap, negative illness perceptions, symptom focussing, fear avoidance, and distress (standardised mean difference [SMD](g) = 0.45; SMD(g) = 0.77; SMD(g) = 0.56; SMD(g) = 0.50, respectively).

Herein, the susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to VZV infection and the ability of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells to control VZV infection in RPE cells in vitro is addressed. METHODS Human primary RPE cell cultures (n=2) were infected with a VZV strain expressing green fluorescent protein. The infection and viability of infected RPE cells was monitored by flow cytometry or by a fluorescent imager on RPE monolayers. RPE cells, pretreated with or without interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), were infected with VZV and subsequently cultured with VZV-specific CD4(+) T-cell clones (TCCs; n=3) recognizing disparate VZV proteins presented by different HLA class II alleles. IFN-gamma production and cytotoxicity of the TCCs in response to VZV-infected RPE cells was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Human RPE cells are permissive to a productive VZV infection. VZV-infected RPE cells presented the cognate antigen to the CD4(+) TCCs only if the RPE cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma and expressed the appropriate HLA class II allele. VZV-specific TCCs inhibited productive VZV infection in RPE cells, which was in part attributed to TCC-mediated killing of the VZV-infected RPE cells.

We describe a rapidly implemented COVID\\\\adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The COVID\\\\adapted pathway integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting high\\\\risk symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as urgent suspicious of cancer. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017C2019 (3.3%).

Japan was one of the first affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic reporting their first case on 14 January 2020. Interventions including airport screening, contact tracing, and cluster investigations were quickly implemented. Here we present insights from the first 3 months of the epidemic in Japan based on detailed case data. Methods We conducted descriptive analyses based on information systematically extracted from individual case reports from 13 January to 31 March 2020 including patient demographics, date of report and symptom onset, symptom progression, travel history, and contact type. We analysed symptom progression and estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, correcting for epidemic growth using an established Bayesian framework. Key delays and the age-specific probability of transmission were estimated using data on exposures and transmission pairs. Results The corrected fitted mean onset-to-reporting delay after the peak was 4 days (standard deviation: {+/-}2 days). Early transmission was driven primarily by returning travellers with Rt peaking at 2.4 (95%CrI:1.6, 3.3) nationally. In the final week of the trusted period, Rt accounting for importations diverged from overall Rt at 1.1 (95% CrI: 1.0, 1.2) compared to 1.5 (95% CrI: 1.3, 1.6) respectively. Household (39.0%) and workplace (11.6%) exposures were the most frequently reported potential source of infection. The estimated probability of transmission was assortative by age. Across all age groups, cases most frequently onset with cough, fever, and fatigue. There were no reported cases of patients <20 years old developing pneumonia or severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusions Information collected in the early phases of an outbreak are important in characterising any novel pathogen. Timely recognition of key symptoms and high-risk settings for transmission can help to inform response strategies. The data analysed here were the result of robust and timely investigations and demonstrate the improvements to epidemic control as a result of such surveillance.","output":"COVID-19 in Japan: insights from the first three months of the epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE) is a rare condition with a chronic relapsing and remitting course, characterized by the presence of annular or polycyclic erythematous and plaque lesions and prominent tissue eosinophilia on histopathology. There is an ongoing discussion on whether EAE is a subset of Wells syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) or a separate entity. To date, few cases of EAE have been reported in the literature; of these, about 40 cases were in adults and fewer than ten cases were in children. Given the rarity of this condition, there are no clear recommendations for its management. Systemic corticosteroids and antimalarials are the most commonly used medications used to treat EAE, but many cases have been reported in the literature that are resistant to treatment with these medications. Here, we present a 65-year-old female with EAE refractory to numerous systemic therapies (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, doxycycline, methotrexate) who showed a good response to mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mepolizumab therapy in a patient with EAE. We also review other treatment strategies that have been used to manage this condition to date. Targeting cytokines crucial for the functioning of eosinophils may be a novel direction in the management of EAE, but prospective, double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies are needed to provide further evidence.","output":"Mepolizumab Therapy for Recalcitrant Eosinophilic Annular Erythema in an Adult: A Case Report and Review of Treatment Options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for >1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were 7/10 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and 10/14 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios.

Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies. The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified. MAIN BODY: Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75C7.54). No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures. Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles. The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material. Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures. A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection. Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission. CONCLUSION: Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating. Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus. Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence. Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.","output":"Aerosol-generating otolaryngology procedures and the need for enhanced PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a loss of clinical clerkship opportunities for medical students. To address this problem while maintaining patient safety, this pilot study explored the feasibility of using a wearable headset to live stream teaching ward rounds to remotely based medical students. Methods: Three live streamed teaching ward rounds were delivered to three groups of medical students (n=53) using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device and Microsoft Teams software, and results pooled for analysis. Feedback was gathered from students and instructors using the evaluation of technology-enhanced learning materials (ETELM). Patient feedback was gathered using the Communication Assessment Tool to explore any impact on interpersonal communication. Results: The response rate for the ETELM-learner perceptions was 58% (31/53), 100% for the ETELM-instructor perceptions. Students strongly agreed that the overall quality of the teaching session and instructors was excellent. However, 32% experienced issues with audio or video quality and one remote student reported cyber sickness. The statement 'educational activities encouraged engagement with session materials/content' returned the most varied response. Instructors reported technological problems with delivery while using the HoloLens 2 device and environmental noise in the ward was a disruptive factor. Preparation and skilled facilitation were key to delivering a high-quality teaching session. Patients reacted generally favourably to the technology and no negative effects on interpersonal communication were identified. Conclusion: The experience of live streamed ward rounds was well received by patients, medical students and teaching faculty. However, there remain limitations to the routine use of HoloLens 2 technology in our setting including steep learning curves, hardware costs and environmental factors such as noise and WiFi connectivity. Live streamed ward rounds have potential postpandemic implications for the judicious use of resources, and the possibility for few educationally minded clinicians to teach at scale in a patient-friendly manner. ?

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of adult patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (27th February to 29th April 2020) confirmed by PCR or subsequent seroconversion, with a systematic assessment 10-14 weeks after disease onset. PCS was defined as the persistence of at least one clinically relevant symptom, or abnormalities in spirometry or chest radiology. Outcome predictors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy seven patients recovered from mild (34.3%) or severe (65.7%) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated 77 days (IQR 72-85) after disease onset. PCS was detected in 141 patients (50.9%; 95%CI 45.0-56.7%). Symptoms were mostly mild. Alterations in spirometry were noted in 25/269 (9.3%), while in radiographs in 51/277 (18.9%). No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of PCS development. CONCLUSIONS: A Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was detected in a half of COVID19 survivors.

BOSTON-1 and BOSTON-2 are two ongoing phase III, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of inhaled L-CsA in patients with BOS following single (BOSTON-1) or double (BOSTON-2) lung transplantation. BOSTON-3 is an open label extension trial for patients who have completed the 48-week treatment period in BOSTON-1 and BOSTON-2 trials. Several Health Authorities and Scientific Societies, including ISHLT, have issued guidance on how to ensure trial participants safety and compliance with Good Clinical Practice, while maintaining trial integrity during the pandemic. For BOS patients, the current situation is especially challenging because of their immunocompromised status. Thus, the trial Sponsor conducted a risk assessment to address challenges for trial conduct during restrictions posed by the pandemic and developed a contingency plan ensuring patient safety, data integrity and treatment continuation. Methods Due to possible restrictions of protocol-scheduled on-site visits, a contingency plan centered around remote visits has been implemented. Patients are contacted by the Investigator and/or appropriately qualified site personnel to assess the patients overall status, wellbeing, and document any potential adverse events (AEs). A process for trial medication shipment from the study site directly to the patient's home was set up, ensuring compliance with all regulatory requirements. Of the utmost importance, the protocols have been amended to include spirometry assessments carried out through a portable spirometer with standardized guidance by study staff and patients. Endpoints With this approach the Sponsor intends to ensure the patients safety and address any limitations to travel and access to investigational sites, while reducing the amount of missing data. The Sponsor implemented ISHLT recommendations to minimize hospital visits and monitor patient's status through home spirometry.","output":"Ensuring Patient Safety and Data Integrity in Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying key spreaders is regarded as one of the fundamental challenging areas in controlling the spread of infections caused due to deadly Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Identification of key spreaders greatly contributes towards the understanding of disease spreading mechanisms during pandemic The resolution of this problem remains very useful for government agencies to make tactical and actionable plans to counter the rapid spread of COVID-19 Various researchers around the world are adopting computational techniques to recognize key spreaders efficiently However, the development of such technologies poses a significant challenge and requires regular improvements over time In this chapter, a method CovidKeySpreader has been proposed that integrates both local and global insight and adopts a random walk algorithm to determine key spreaders in a patient interaction network related to Indias different states For implementation, a state-wise network is constructed where nodes represent an individual patient and edges show interaction link between them Each node of the network is assigned to associated communities Further, communities are analyzed by exploiting both node and community scores Finally, a random walk algorithm is applied to the weighted network to iteratively rank nodes The efficacy of the proposed method is established using Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) spreading model and simulate the process of spreading on networks Experiments conducted on four state-wise networks The evaluation metric shows that the key spreaders identified by our proposed algorithm are more significant in comparison to other basic centrality measures ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Social Network Analysis for the Identification of Key Spreaders During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored the associations between physical activity (PA) anxiety levels, and the perception of satisfaction of basic psychological needs (BPN), during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown Thus, 1,404 participants (977 women, 426 men, and one respondent preferred not to answer) ranging from 18 to 89 years old (36 4 +/- 11 7 year-old) completed a questionnaire in the period between 1st and 15th April 2021 The survey included sociodemographic data and the following validated instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine variation in anxiety levels and BPN satisfaction according to PA category (low, moderate, and high) Spearman's Rho correlations coefficients were used to determine the association between anxiety levels and psychological needs Individuals presenting a higher level of PA revealed lower levels of anxiety-state (H = 20 14;p &lt; 0 01) Differences between elements from different levels of PA were found for the autonomy (H = 23 52;p &lt; 0 001), competence (H = 18 89;p &lt; 0 001), and relatedness (H = 24 42;p &lt; 0 001) psychological needs, suggesting that those who feel their BPN as more satisfied have higher levels of PA The study found statistically significant correlations between anxiety-state and the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy (p = 0 01;r = -0 46), competence (p = 0 01;r = -0 40), and relatedness (p = 0 01;r = -0 21) These findings support the importance that PA has in the anxiety levels during social isolation, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary teams in an individual-based approach","output":"Higher Physical Activity Levels May Help Buffer the Negative Psychological Consequences of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to report a bilateral conjunctivitis case in a patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Although the mechanism of action of INM is not yet fully understood, recent studies have indicated that it acts at an early stage of the coronaviruses (CoVs) replication cycle. In addition, a proteomic study reported that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of INM could be also ascribed to its ability to inhibit human prostaglandin E synthase type 2 (PGES-2), a host protein which interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 protein.

However, whether winter supplementation of vitamin D reduces the risk among children is unknown. Objective To determine whether high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in young children. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial was conducted during the winter months between September 13, 2011, and June 30, 2015, among children aged 1 through 5 years enrolled in TARGet Kids!, a multisite primary care practice-based research network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Interventions Three hundred forty-nine participants were randomized to receive 2000 IU/d of vitamin D oral supplementation (high-dose group) vs 354 participants who were randomized to receive 400 IU/d (standard-dose group) for a minimum of 4 months between September and May. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was the number of laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory tract infections based on parent-collected nasal swabs over the winter months. Secondary outcomes included the number of influenza infections, noninfluenza infections, parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses, time to first upper respiratory tract infection, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at study termination. Results Among 703 participants who were randomized (mean age, 2.7 years, 57.7% boys), 699 (99.4%) completed the trial. The mean number of laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infections per child was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19) for the high-dose group and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.16) for the standard-dose group, for a between-group difference of 0.02 (95% CI, -0.17 to 0.21) per child. There was no statistically significant difference in number of laboratory-confirmed infections between groups (incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16). There was also no significant difference in the median time to the first laboratory-confirmed infection: 3.95 months (95% CI, 3.02-5.95 months) for the high-dose group vs 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.66-4.14 months) for the standard-dose group, or number of parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses between groups (625 for high-dose vs 600 for standard-dose groups, incidence RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16). At study termination, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 48.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 46.9-50.5 ng/mL) in the high-dose group and 36.8 ng/mL (95% CI, 35.4-38.2 ng/mL) in the standard-dose group. Conclusions and Relevance Among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily administration of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper respiratory tract infections.

The present paper addresses roles which spiritual systems might play in facing the COVID-19 disease crisis, considering different areas of spiritual well-being and the possibility that spiritual systems might be affected by perceived challenges during a pandemic. Because of the problems interfering with overcoming COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of next waves of its epidemics and pandemics, it is necessary for health policy-makers to use all available capacities and capabilities to counteract the disease, including using both internal motivations (such as spiritual beliefs which prohibit hurting oneself and others and which emphasize performing social responsibilities) and external ones (e.g. regulations) to cope with it.

METHODS We used databases from open access public domains to record population median age, mean ambient temperature, and the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths on days 14 and 28 from the pandemic outbreak for each country in the world. We then calculated the correlation between these parameters. RESULTS The analysis included 202 countries. A univariate analysis showed that population median age significantly correlated with the cumulative number of cases and deaths, while mean ambient temperature showed a significant inverse correlation with the cumulative number of deaths on days 14 and 28 from the epidemic outbreak. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis only population median age retained its statistically significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS Country population median age significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic burden while mean ambient temperature shows a significant inverse correlation only in univariate analysis.

However, despite its diverse role in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological functions, knowledge about the KKS in vivo remains limited. The short half-lives of kinins, their low abundance and structural similarities and the artificial generation of the kinin bradykinin greatly hinder reliable and accurate determination of kinin levels in plasma. To address these issues, a sensitive LC-MS/MS platform for the comprehensive and simultaneous determination of the four active kinins bradykinin, kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and des-Arg(10)-kallidin and their major metabolites bradykinin 2-9, bradykinin 1-7 and bradykinin 1-5 was developed. This platform was validated according to the bioanalytical guideline of the US Food and Drug Administration regarding linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, carry-over, recovery, parallelism, matrix effects and stability in plasma of healthy volunteers. The validated platform encompassed a broad calibration curve range from 2.0-15.3 pg/mL (depending on the kinin) up to 1000 pg/mL, covering the expected concentrations in disease states. No source-dependent matrix effects were identified, and suitable stability of the analytes in plasma was observed. The applicability of the developed platform was proven by the determination of endogenous levels in healthy volunteers, whose plasma kinin levels were successfully detected in the low pg/mL range. The established platform facilitates the investigation of kinin-mediated diseases (e.g. angioedema, COVID-19) and enables the assessment of the impact of altered enzyme activities on the formation or degradation of kinins.","output":"Targeted LC-MS/MS platform for the comprehensive determination of peptides in the kallikrein-kinin system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective: based on the analysis of published data and results of own research, to present scientifically valid procedures for respiratory support in acute respiratory distress syndrome of various origins Results: The article specifies approaches to escalation and de-escalation methods of optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure and duration of the inspiratory phase, the use of \\"lung opening\\", mechanical ventilation in the prone position, endotracheal administration of Surfactant BL, as well as the combination of these methods, their advantages, disadvantages, indications and contraindications, and potential complications ? 2020 Messenger of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation All rights reserved","output":"Contemporary procedure for respiratory support in acute respiratory distress syndrome of various genesis (lecture)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To test the potential for parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vectors to provide protection from vaccinia virus (VACV) infection, PIV5 was engineered to express secreted VACV L1R and B5R proteins, two important antigens for neutralization of intracellular mature (IMV) and extracellular enveloped (EEV) virions, respectively. Protection of mice from lethal intranasal VACV challenge required intranasal immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R in a prime-boost protocol, and correlated with low VACV-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-VACV neutralizing antibody. Mice immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R showed some disease symptoms following VACV challenge such as loss of weight and hunching, but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice. While immunization with PIV5 expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization included the PIV5 vector expressing L1R alone or in combination with PIV5-B5R. PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors elicited protection from VACV challenge even when CD8+ cells were depleted, but not in the case of mice that were defective in B cell production. Mice were protected from VACV challenge out to at least 1.5 years after immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors, and showed significant levels of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies.

We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate.

Various speculations mention that the long-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can cause pulmonary fibrosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one that can cause pulmonary fibrosis due to injury to the lungs. CASE REPORT: This report discusses a case of pulmonary fibrosis caused by critical COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) in 38-year-old male patient with hypertension and obesity comorbidities. The patient was treated for 51 days in intensive care unit with 60 L/min high flow nasal cannula assisted oxygenation;then his condition improved as evidenced by his negative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction test result, and was subsequently transferred to a non-COVID-19 ward using non-rebreathing mask at 10C15 L/min, which was later titrated to 2C4 L/min nasal canulla. Patient was treated in the non-COVID ward for 16 days. The total number of days of hospitalization was 67 days. Patient had his thorax photo taken 3 times and non-contrast thorax computed tomography (CT) scan 3 times. Based on the evaluation of his thorax CT scan on day 23, we found a vast fibrosis in patients lungs. Many literatures state that lung fibrosis can be triggered by ARDS, a condition due to the infection from SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection can progress overtime and may cause pulmonary fibrosis. The most serious phase of this virus infection is characterized by sudden and excessive release of proinflammatory mediators that lead to lung damage with large fibrosis and rapid onset of ARDS.

Despite the little information on the psychological impact on international students, we aimed to assess the psychological outcomes and associated factors among international students currently living in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 28, 2020 to June 12, 2020 on 402 full-time international students across 26 provinces in China. The frequency of symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, psychological distress, loneliness, and fear was assessed with the English versions of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) scales, respectively. Results: The prevalence of symptoms of depression (73.4%), anxiety (76.6%), stress (58.5%), insomnia (77.6%), psychological distress (71.4%), loneliness (62.4%), and fear (73.1%) among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic was shown. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms of all psychological outcomes was significantly associated with 26C30-year-old students, students who lived with roommates, and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Participants in the central region reported significantly moderate to extremely severe symptom levels of all the psychological outcomes except fear symptoms. Univariate analysis indicated that a significant association of all psychological outcomes was found among 26C30-year-old students and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Multivariate analysis showed that Engineering, Business, Social Sciences and Law, and Language students were significantly associated with the symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fear. Participants staying in China for shorter than 2 years were associated with a higher risk of all psychological outcomes except psychological distress and loneliness symptoms. Conclusions: We found a higher prevalence of psychological outcomes and risk factors among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Detailed knowledge of the expression regulation of genes required for viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells is urgently needed. METHODS: Here we assess the expression patterns of genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and their regulation by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, throughout the respiratory tract using samples collected from the upper (nasal) and lower airways (bronchi). FINDINGS: Genes encoding viral receptors and activating protease are increased in the nose compared to the bronchi in matched samples and associated with the proportion of secretory epithelial cells in cellular deconvolution analyses. Current or ex-smoking was found to increase expression of these genes only in lower airways, which was associated with a significant increase in the predicted proportion of goblet cells. Both acute and second hand smoke exposure were found to increase ACE2 expression while inhaled corticosteroids decrease ACE2 expression in the lower airways. A strong association of DNA- methylation with ACE2 and TMPRSS2- mRNA expression was identified. INTERPRETATION: Genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells are high in upper airways, but strongly increased in lower airways by smoke exposure. In contrast, ICS decreases ACE2 expression, indicating that inhaled corticosteroids are unlikely to increase the risk for more severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene expression in upper and lower airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategic planning has recently focused its attention on the elements that characterize the spaces through which the agents move, paying particular attention on the way in which they incorporate them.

Trafficking and exploitation for sex or labor affects millions of persons worldwide, but their use of the healthcare system is not characterized systematically. In 2018 new ICD-10 codes were implemented in the US for diagnosis of patients who were victims of trafficking or exploitation but todate no comprehensive study reported on their medical journeys. Our objective was to examine the extent to which newly implemented ICD-10 codes pertaining to human trafficking were being used in the healthcare system, and to characterize the care received by the victims. Methods and Findings. Database search of a large US health insurer that contained approximately 43 million patients holding commercial or government-provided health insurance across the United States (US). For the dates 2018-09-01 to 2022-03-01, the dataset was found to contain 3,967 instances of the ICD-10 codes. In 31% of the cases, the codes were used as the principal or admitting diagnosis. Regression analysis of the codes found a 2% increase in the adoption of these codes. The codes were used by 1,532 distinct providers, the majority in non-hospital settings. The data contained 2301 patients of which 1025 were treated for recent exploitation or trafficking, which corresponds to identification of 13 new patients each week. Of the latter patients, 90.1% were victims of sexual exploitation, and 9.9% victims of labor exploitation. The patients were predominantly female (81%), insured by Medicaid (60%) and the median age was 20 (interquartile range: 15-35). Healthcare utilization over 12 months after diagnosis of trafficking was $32,192 (standard deviation: $160,730) - much greater than average for Medicaid patients ($6,556 per year in 2019). The victims were characterized by a high prevalence of mental health conditions, high utilization of the emergency department, and these persisted after diagnosis of exploitation. Surprisingly, 57% of the victims were first diagnosed outside hospitals, primarily during office and psychiatric visits, and only 25% were first diagnosed during an emergency department visit. Conclusions. The new ICD-10 codes provide valuable insights into the profiles and medical journeys of victims of trafficking. However, adoption of the codes is not widespread, increasing by only 2% per year and the majority of the victims are likely still not diagnosed by the new codes. Greater adoption, when consistent with patient safety, may improve care coordination and outcomes.","output":"Medical journeys of victims of exploitation and trafficking: a retrospective cohort study using a large multi-state dataset and new ICD-10 codes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-The purpose of the article is to study the impact of the ICT sector on economic development of countries based on the comparative analysis of this sector development in some Eastern European countries.

OBJECTIVE To explore the effects of maternal SARS-CoV2 infection on the neonates and placental pathology in comparison to those from the normal pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN Maternal, neonatal and placental pathology data were collected from medical records between March and August 2020 from New York Presbyterian- Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. The data from a total 142 neonates and 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers were compared with those from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers. RESULTS There were 142 SARS-CoV2 positive mothers within the study group, and 43 (36%) of them showed various degrees of COVID19 related clinical symptoms including fever (13.8%), cough (5.7%), loss of taste/smell (anosmia)(5.6%), shortness of breath (2.4%), muscle ache (2.4%), headache (1.6%) and pneumonia (0.8%). A total 142 neonates were born to the SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, and only 1 neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV2 in the first 24 h. Two additional neonates were initially tested negative in first 24 h, and later tested positive on day 7 and the 1 month visit, and all these neonates were asymptomatic and had no sequelae. There was no increase of pre-term labor and delivery or NICU admissions from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Examination of 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers and 121 placentas from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers revealed no increase of placental pathologic features. There were more vaginal deliveries and more meconium stain of fetal membranes from the SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Previous reports of more maternal vascular malperfusion and fetal vascular malperfusion were not demonstrated in our current data.

During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.","output":"Pool testing on random and natural clusters of individuals: Optimisation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the presence of low viral load samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The liver is an organ with paradoxic immunologic properties and is known for its tolerant microenvironment, which holds important implications for hepatic diseases. The molecular basis for this local immune suppression, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin), a recently identified member of the dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) family, in the regulation of hepatic T-cell immune response. METHODS: The regulation of T-cell effector function by LSECtin was determined by co-stimulated T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody and LSECtin protein, or co-culture of T-cell receptor transgenic T cells with mouse LSECs in vitro. We generated LSECtin knockout mice and prepared recombinant LSECtin protein and complementary DNA plasmids to analyze the role of LSECtin in hepatic T-cell immune regulation in vivo. RESULTS: We showed that LSECtin specifically recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated their immune responses. In mice with T-cellCmediated acute liver injury, the lack of LSECtin accelerated the disease owing to an increased T-cell immune response, whereas the exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that LSECtin is a novel regulator of T cells and expose a crucial mechanism for hepatic T-cell immune suppression, perhaps opening up a new approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases in the liver.","output":"Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell Lectin, LSECtin, Negatively Regulates Hepatic T-Cell Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020 changed organ transplantation.

Our transplant program collaborated with our transplant infectious disease colleagues to create a protocol that would ensure both patient and staff safety during these unprecedented times. METHODS: The living donor program was electively placed on hold until we had the proper protocols in place. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was required for all recipients and living donors. All patients underwent a rapid nasopharyngeal swab test. After testing negative by nasopharyngeal swab, recipients also underwent a low-radiation-dose computed tomography scan to rule out any radiographic changes suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We performed 8 living donor and 9 deceased donor kidney transplants. In comparison, we performed 10 living donor and 4 deceased donor transplants during the same time period in the previous year. Our testing protocol enabled efficient use of all suitable organs offered during the viral pandemic. No recipients or living donors tested positive or developed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Creation of a viral testing protocol, developed in conjunction with our infectious disease team, permitted kidney transplantation to be performed safely, and the number of deceased donor transplants increased considerably without adversely affecting our outcomes.","output":"Navigating Kidney Transplantation in the Early Phase of Coronavirus Disease 2019: Screening Patients With Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Low-Radiation-Dose Chest Computed Tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Video Conferencing Systems (VCS) are used dailyat work, in online education, and for get-togethers with friends and family. Many new VCSs have emerged in the past decade and a new market-leader has risen during the coronavirus period of 2020. Understanding how these systems work could help us improve them rapidly. However, no experimental comparison of such systems currently exists. In this work we propose a method to compare VCSs in real-world operation and implement it as a tool. Our method considers four main kinds of real-world experiments. Each captures different aspects, such as communication channels (audio, video, audio-video) and types of network environments (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi, 4G), and reports system and network utilization. We further implement an automated tool to conduct these real-world experiments, and experiment with three popular VCSs, Zoom, Microsoft Team, and Discord. We find that there are significant performance differences between these systems, and their behavior in different environments. ? 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","output":"An empirical evaluation of video conferencing systems used in industry, academia, and entertainment [work-in-progress]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been hypothesized that even 'perfect' polygenic scores (PGSs) composed of only causal variants may not be fully portable between different social groups owing to gene-by-environment interactions modifying the expression of relevant variants. The impacts of such interactions involving two forms of social adversity (low socioeconomic status [SES] and discrimination) are examined in relation to the expressivity of a PGS for educational attainment composed of putatively causal variants in a large, representatively sampled and genotyped cohort of US children. A relatively small-magnitude Scarr-Rowe effect is present (SES  PGSEDU predicting General Cognitive Ability [GCA]; sR = .02, 95% CI [.00, .04]), as is a distinct discrimination  PGSEDU interaction predicting GCA (sR = -.02, 95% CI [-.05, 00]). Both are independent of the confounding main effects of 10 ancestral principal components, PGSEDU, SES, discrimination and interactions among these factors. No sex differences were found. These interactions were examined in relation to phenotypic and genotypic data on height, a prospectively more socially neutral trait. They were absent in both cases. The discrimination  PGSEDU interaction is a co-moderator of the differences posited in modern versions of Spearman's hypothesis (along with shared environmentality), lending support to certain environmental explanations of those differences. Behavior-genetic analysis of self-reported discrimination indicates that it is nonsignificantly heritable (h2 = .027, 95% CI [-.05, .10]), meaning that it is not merely proxying some underlying source of heritable phenotypic variability. This suggests that experiences of discrimination might stem instead from the action of purely social forces.","output":"Social Adversity Reduces Polygenic Score Expressivity for General Cognitive Ability, but Not Height."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment goals for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are prolonging survival and improving the quality of life. Eribulin, a non-taxane tubulin inhibitor, demonstrated improved survival in previous studies and also showed mild toxicity when used in late-line therapy for MBC. We conducted a phase II study to investigate the efficacy of eribulin mesylate as the first-line chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative MBC. This was a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial conducted in Japan. Patients with HER2-negative MBC received intravenous eribulin (1.4 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle). The primary efficacy outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included time to treatment failure, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 35 patients were enrolled and received a median of 8 (range 1-21) cycles of eribulin therapy. ORR and clinical benefit rate were 54.3 and 62.9 %, respectively. Median PFS was 5.8 months and median OS was 35.9 months. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 63 % of patients. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild in severity. The present trial demonstrated that eribulin has antitumor activity comparable with other key established cytotoxic agents with acceptable safety and tolerability.

PURPOSE: To describe our hospital pharmacy departments preparation for an influx of critically ill patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and offer guidance on clinical pharmacy services preparedness for similar crisis situations. SUMMARY: Personnel within the department of pharmacy at a medical center at the US epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic proactively prepared a staffing and pharmacotherapeutic action plan in anticipation of an expected surge in admissions of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and expansion of acute care and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Guidance documents focusing on supportive care and pharmacotherapeutic treatment options were developed. Repurposing of nonCICU-trained clinical pharmacotherapy specialists to work collaboratively with clinician teams in ICUs was quickly implemented; staff were prepared for these duties through use of shared tools to facilitate education and practice standardization. CONCLUSION: As challenges were encountered at the peak of the pandemic, interdisciplinary collaboration and teamwork was crucial to ensure that all patients were proactively assessed and that their respective pharmacotherapeutic regimens were optimized.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic preparedness: A practical guide from clinical pharmacists perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Varicocele is abnormal dilation of testis veins. The precise mechanism of varicocele is not fully understood despite some hypothesis were suggested in the literature. Disequilibrium between constrictor and dilatator mechanism of the veins have been shown to cause varicocele. High-grade varicoceles have been also linked to endothelial dysfunction and increased vasoconstriction. Objectives: We hypothesized that epicardial fat thickness (EFT), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and aortic stiffness (AS) could be associated with varicocele. In the present study, we aimed to compare vascular parameters such as FMD, EFT and AS in healthy subjects and high-grade varicocele patients. Methods: The study population consisted of 35 men with high-grade varicocele and 32 age- and sex-matched control subjects younger than 45 years old. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Hospital between May to October 2018. Results: EFT, aortic diastolic diameters (AoDD) and EFT/BMI ratio were significantly higher in control group than in patients with high-grade (p=0.012, p=0.044, p=0.026, respectively). EFT and EFT /BMI ratio were significantly and inversely correlated with presence of varicocele (r=-0.422, p=0.009; r=-0.38, p=0.026, respectively).

CSF represents not only a mechanical brain protection but also a rich source of signalling factors modulating diverse processes during brain development and adulthood. The choroid plexus (CP) is a major source of CSF and as such it has recently emerged as an important mediator of extracellular signalling within the brain. Growing interest in the CP revealed its capacity to release a broad variety of bioactive molecules that, via CSF, regulate processes across the whole central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, CP has been also recognized as a sensor, responding to altered composition of CSF associated with changes in the patterns of CNS activity. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in our understanding of the CP as a signalling centre that mediates long-range communication in the CNS. By providing a detailed account of the CP secretory repertoire, we describe how the CP contributes to the regulation of the extracellular environmentin the context of both the embryonal as well as the adult CNS. We highlight the role of the CP as an important regulator of CNS function that acts via CSF-mediated signalling. Further studies of CPCCSF signalling hold the potential to provide key insights into the biology of the CNS, with implications for better understanding and treatment of neuropathological conditions.","output":"Choroid Plexus: The Orchestrator of Long-Range Signalling Within the CNS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Diarrhea is the most common illness in children under 5 years of age, accounting for a financial burden for families in developing countries. Objective The aim of this study is to determine the out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrhoeal illness among the under-five children in in-patient and out-patient cases. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during January-April 2018 among 60 under-five children with diarrheal illness reporting to pediatric outpatient department (OPD) and 60 under-five children admitted to pediatric ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital. For determining the out-of-pocket health expenditure, both direct and indirect costs for the management of diarrheal illness were estimated both for out-patient and in-patient cases. The cost of the treatment has been presented as the cost of prehospital visits, during a hospital visit and posthospital visit. Results Overall, median out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrheal illness for out-patient and in-patient cases were Rs. 1186 (interquartile range [IQR]: Rs. 510) and Rs. 6385 (IQR: Rs. 5889), respectively. The median direct expenditure for OPD cases was Rs. 778.50 (IQR: Rs. 263) and indirect expenditure for OPD cases were Rs. 407.50 (IQR: Rs. 336) The median direct and indirect expenditure for inpatient cases were Rs. 3823 (IQR: Rs. 1942) and Rs. 2237 (IQR: Rs. 4256) respectively. Only 13% of in-patient cases had some kind of medical insurance. Conclusion A considerable economic burden is faced by the families for treating diarrhea in under-five children. Improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, promotion of hand hygiene, exclusive breastfeeding, rotavirus vaccination, and use of oral rehydration therapy will reduce hospitalization and out-of-pocket expenditure.

We argue that existing approaches to studying existential risk are not yet fit for purpose, and perhaps even run the risk of increasing harm. We highlight general challenges in ERS: accommodating value pluralism, crafting precise definitions, developing comprehensive tools for risk assessment, dealing with uncertainty, and accounting for the dangers associated with taking exceptional actions to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The most influential framework for ERS, the 'techno-utopian approach' (TUA), struggles with these issues and has a unique set of additional problems: it unnecessarily combines the study of longtermism and longtermist ethics with the study of extinction, relies on a non-representative moral worldview, uses ambiguous and inadequate definitions, fails to incorporate insights from risk assessment in relevant fields, chooses arbitrary categorisations of risk, and advocates for dangerous mitigation strategies. Its moral and empirical assumptions might be particularly vulnerable to securitisation and misuse. We suggest several key improvements: separating the study of extinction ethics (ethical implications of extinction) and existential ethics (the ethical implications of different societal forms), from the analysis of human extinction and global catastrophe; drawing on the latest developments in risk assessment literature; diversifying the field, and; democratising its policy recommendations.","output":"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the case of a patient with a previously placed Port-A-Cath who was admitted to hospital for new onset of non-flushing catheter and palpitations with ventricular tachycardia.

Exploring the association of weather variables and COVID-19 transmission is vital in understanding the potential for seasonality and future outbreaks and developing early warning systems. Previous research examined the effects of weather on COVID-19, but the findings appeared inconsistent. This review aims to summarize the currently available literature on the association between weather and COVID-19 incidence and provide possible suggestions for developing weather-based early warning system for COVID-19 transmission. Studies eligible for inclusion used ecological methods to evaluate associations between weather (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed and rainfall) and COVID-19 transmission. The review showed that temperature was reported as significant in the greatest number of studies, with COVID-19 incidence increasing as temperature decreased and the highest incidence reported in the temperature range of 0C17 C. Humidity was also significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence, though the reported results were mixed, with studies reporting positive and negative correlation. A significant interaction between humidity and temperature was also reported. Wind speed and rainfall results were not consistent across studies. Weather variables including temperature and humidity can contribute to increased transmission of COVID-19, particularly in winter conditions through increased host susceptibility and viability of the virus. While there is less indication of an association with wind speed and rainfall, these may contribute to behavioral changes that decrease exposure and risk of infection. Understanding the implications of associations with weather variables and seasonal variations for monitoring and control of future outbreaks is essential for early warning systems.","output":"Weather Variability and COVID-19 Transmission: A Review of Recent Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT).

All patients were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-RNA and for antigen tests. Results were obtained from 1146 patients. The COVID-19 Ag FIA kit showed a baseline sensitivity of 53.8% (CI 35.4C71.4%), baseline specificity 99.7% (CI 98.4C100%) and overall accuracy of 80% (95% CI 0.68C0.91); the AFIAS COVID-19 Ag kit, baseline sensitivity of 86.4% (CI 75.0C93.9%), baseline specificity 98.3% (CI 97.1C99.1%) and overall accuracy of 95.3% (95% CI 0.92C0.99). In both tests, some samples showed very low viral load and negative Ag-RDT. This disagreement may reflect the positive inability of Ag-RDTs of detecting antigen in late phase of infection. Among all cases with positive molecular test and negative antigen test, none showed viral loads > 10(6) copies/mL. Finally, we found one false Ag-RDTs negative result (low cycle thresholds; 9  10(5) copies/mL). Our results suggest that both Ag-RDTs showed good performances in detection of high viral load samples, making it a feasible and effective tool for mass screening in actively infected children.","output":"Feasibility and Effectiveness Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Antigenic Tests in Mass Screening of a Pediatric Population and Correlation with the Kinetics of Viral Loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Let G=(V,E) be an undirected loopless graph with possible parallel edges and s and t be two vertices of G.

The number of patients visiting outpatient internal medicine clinics decreased during March-April 2020 compared to 2019. Moreover, the ban on telephone re-examination for outpatient clinics in lieu of ambulatory care for chronic diseases has been lifted since March 2020. In this context, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory care at Japanese outpatient clinics for patients with chronic neurological diseases during the first half of 2020. Methods: We collected data from the administrative claims database by DeSC Healthcare. Serial changes in the frequency of subsequent outpatient visits to clinics or hospitals (excluding large hospitals with beds >200) for chronic ambulatory care of epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease were measured. We also evaluated the utilization rate of telephone re-examination at outpatient clinics. Results: Since April 2020, the monthly count of outpatient clinic visits for epilepsy or PD decreased slightly but significantly. The use of telephone re-examination was facility-dependent, and it was used in less than 5% of all outpatient clinic visits for the examined neurological diseases in May 2020. The utilization rate of telephone re-examination was not associated with age or the neurological diseases of interest.

Already in the early stages of the pandemic, following the discovery that the virus uses the ACE2 cell receptor as a molecular target to infect the cells of our body, it was hypothesized that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Since then, numerous studies have been published on the subject, but the exact role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. RAAS represents an important protagonist in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, providing the virus with the receptor of entry into host cells and determining its organotropism. Furthermore, following infection, the virus is able to cause an increase in plasma ACE2 activity, compromising the normal function of the RAAS. This dysfunction could contribute to the establishment of the thrombo-inflammatory state characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19. Drugs targeting RAAS represent promising therapeutic options for COVID-19 sufferers.","output":"Lock, Stock and Barrel: Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of sporadic and epidemic dengue fever cases have reportedly been increasing in recent years in some West African countries, such as Senegal and Mali. The first epidemic of laboratory-confirmed dengue occurred in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania situated in the Saharan desert, in 2014. On-site diagnosis of dengue fever was established using a rapid diagnostic test for dengue. In parallel, the presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the city was confirmed. The initial diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR, which showed that all samples from the 2014 dengue epidemic in Nouakchott were dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The whole genome or envelope protein gene of these strains, together with other DENV-2 strains obtained from travelers returning from West African countries to France between 2016 and 2019 (including two Mauritanian strains in 2017 and 2018), were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a recent emergence of an epidemic strain from the cosmopolitan genotype belonging to West African cosmopolitan lineage II, which is genetically distinct from African sylvatic genotype. The origin of this DENV-2 lineage is still unknown, but our data seem to suggest a recent and rapid dispersion of the epidemic strain throughout the region.

Recent systematic reviews of early childhood obesity prevention interventions have not adequately reported on the way interventions are delivered and the experiences/perceptions of stakeholders. We aimed to summarise the literature in early childhood obesity prevention interventions delivered via telephone or text messages for evidence of application of process evaluation primarily to evaluate stakeholders' acceptability of interventions. METHODS A systematic search of major electronic databases was carried out using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes framework. Studies were included if interventions were delivered via telephone/text messages; aimed at changing caregivers' behaviours to prevent early childhood obesity; with one or more outcomes related to early obesity risk factors such as breastfeeding, solid feeding, tummy time, sleep and settling, physical activity and screen time; published from inception to May 2020. All eligible studies were independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. Qualitative studies were assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research tools. RESULTS Twenty-four studies were eligible, and the overall risk of bias was low. Eight studies (33%) had evidence of process evaluation that examined participants' perceptions of interventions. Participants appreciated the convenience of receiving interventions via telephone or text messages. 63% of all studies in this review showed improvement in one or more behaviours related to childhood obesity prevention. Participants were likely to modify behaviours if they received information from a credible source such as from health professionals. CONCLUSION There is limited reporting of stakeholders' experiences in early obesity prevention studies delivered by telephone or text messages. Only one-third of studies examined participants' acceptability and the potential for delivery of childhood obesity prevention interventions conveniently using this mode of delivery. Interventions delivered remotely via telephone or text messages have the potential to reach equal or a greater number of participants than those delivered via face-to-face methods. Future research should build in process evaluation alongside effectiveness measurements to provide important insight into intervention reach, acceptability and to inform scale up.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Observations: Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era requires addressing not only pandemic-specific suicide risk factors, but also prepandemic risk factors. This Special Communication provides prioritized, evidence-based strategies for clinicians and health care delivery systems, along with national and local policy and educational initiatives tailored to the COVID-19 environment. If implemented to scale, these interventions could significantly mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on suicide risk.","output":"Suicide Prevention in the COVID-19 Era: Transforming Threat Into Opportunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu makalede, Yeni Normal olarak adland?r?lan Covid-19 ba?lam?nda ?rgtlerde meydana gelen de?i?iklikler ile dijitalle?me srecinin y?netim zerindeki etkileri irdelenmi?tir.

Trauma and orthopaedic surgery was one of the most severely affected specialties as all non-emergency surgical cases were cancelled. With the possibility of future peak of corona virus, knowing the impact of Covid on orthopaedics would enable us to manage trauma patient in an effective manner and will help us to resume normal schedule of the trauma care. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. We studied the details of total number of patient at Orthopaedic and trauma outpatient, inpatient and operation theatre of Karnali Academy of Health Sciences from 14th March 2020 to 16 September 2020 as compared with the patient data from the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: There were 2288 patients during the non-Covid period who visited to the orthopaedic outpatient in comparison to 1618 during Covid period. Only 5 implant removals were performed in comparison to 50 removals (90% reduction) in elective cases. But the number of surgical cases was almost similar (204 vs 207 respectively). Total number of hospital stay had significantly reduced in the non-COVID period (average 4 days vs 6 days). There were 181 in-patient admissions during the COVID period while 241 admission during the non-COVID period. CONCLUSIONS: There is reduction in number of orthopaedic and trauma cases during COVID 19 with marked reduction in number of elective cases.

This is based on the findings that apoptogenic mutants of insect viruses cannot grow because infected host cells die by apoptosis. This suggests that the apoptotic response of host cells has a deleterious effect on virus infection. Thus, apoptosis is an important host defense mechanism that is capable of inhibiting viral replication during infection. However, in vitro studies indicated that apoptosis alone does not provide the same protection against viral infection in animal cells as it does in the insect cells. Still, most animal viruses have acquired a strategy to overcome host cell apoptosis. In addition, a varying degree of necrosis usually accompanies apoptosis, suggesting a possible contribution of necrosis to the host reactions against virus. To understand the physiological significance of apoptosis during animal virus infection, we have characterized viral growth and the cellular responses against virus infection in a wide variety of virus-cell interaction systems.

METHODS This was a pilot, double-blinded, randomized controlled study (phase IIa). Intermittent inhalations of nitric oxide 160 ppm for 30 min or oxygen/air (control) were given 5 times/day to hospitalized infants (2-11 months) with acute bronchiolitis. Oxygen saturation, methemoglobin, and nitric dioxide (NO2 ) levels and vital signs were monitored. RESULTS Forty-three infants were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both study groups. Mean clinical score, comprised of four components: respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles, wheezes and crackles, and % room-air oxygen saturation, was 7.86 (1.1) and 8.09 (1.2) in the NO and control groups, respectively, consistent with moderate severity. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between the groups. Repeated nitric oxide inhalations did not result in increased inhaled NO2 levels or cumulative effect on methemoglobin levels. Secondary outcomes of efficacy were measured by length of hospitalization (LOS) in hours: LOS did not differ between groups. However, in a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of infants hospitalized for >24 h (n = 24), the median LOS was shorter in the nitric oxide (41.9 h) than in the control group (62.5 h) (P = 0.014).

We undertook a clinical study at the National Paediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh to evaluate clinical diagnostic parameters for dengue and predictors of disease outcome. METHODS: Between September 2011 and January 2013, all consecutive inpatients aged between 1 and 15 years and presenting with suspected dengue were enrolled. They were clinically assessed using both the 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue classifications. Specimens were collected upon admission and discharge and tested for dengue at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. RESULTS: A total of 701 patients were screened. Of these, 79 % were dengue-confirmed by laboratory testing, and 21 % tested dengue-negative. A positive tourniquet test, absence of upper respiratory symptoms, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases were independent predictors for laboratory-confirmed dengue among the children. The presence of several warning signs on hospital admission was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of two or more warning signs was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe dengue at hospital admission. Thus, a cumulative score combining simple clinical parameters and first-line laboratory findings could be used to accurately predict dengue virus infection in pediatric populations, optimizing triage in settings with limited laboratory resources.

This is particularly relevant for immigrant patients who are less inclined to take an active role in consultations. The present study described health professionals practices and experiences of coproducing healthcare service with immigrant and refugee patients in clinical encounters. METHODS: We conducted a three-phase qualitative study with immigrant and refugee patients and health professionals at an interdisciplinary outpatient clinic for immigrants and refugees with complex long-standing health problems at a Danish university hospital. First, we conducted 25 observations of consultations between seven professionals (three doctors, three nurses, one social worker) and 24 patients with varied backgrounds and health problems. Findings were discussed in a focus group and individual interviews with the migrant clinic's staff. Finally, the themes were discussed with co-researchers and revised in a member check with experienced clinicians. Data were analyzed through meaning condensation, supported by the NVivo software. RESULTS: We identified four themes characterizing the work of health professionals in creating coproduced healthcare service: a team effort of sense-making, disentangling the chaos first, when everything fails - listen to the patient, and continuity - becoming part of the patient's story. CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary work fostering values of doing what makes sense to form a positive partnership with the patient allows health professionals to act autonomously, flexibly, and creatively. Using communication tools designed around patient needs, create optimal conditions for coproduction as health professionals empathically validate and integrate patient experiences. Professionals need advanced listening and relational skills and tolerance of ambiguity and insecurity. Relational continuity facilitates long-term coproduction but also bears risks of emotional dependency.","output":"What it really takes C A qualitative study of how professionals coproduce healthcare service with immigrant patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic brought sweeping social change, with stay-at-home orders and physical distancing mandates in 43 of 50 states by April 2020. Early on, isolated studies around the world described reduced hospital admissions. Reports from some US hospitals also described declines in catheterization laboratory activations, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke admissions. However, there have been few population-based analyses of emergency department (ED) visits to verify these initial reports and describe longer term impacts of the pandemic on care seeking behavior. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that AMI and stroke ED visits in North Carolina (NC) would decrease substantially after a statewide stay-at-home order was announced on March 27, 2020. Methods: We analyzed all ED visits from January 5 to August 28, 2020 using data collected by the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool, a syndromic surveillance system that automatically gathers ED data in near-real time for all EDs in NC. Counts of AMI and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) were ascertained using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. We compared weekly 2020 ED visit data before and after NC's stay-at-home order, and to 2019 ED visit data. Results: Overall ED volume declined by 44% in the weeks before and after the stay-at-home order(Figure) while the prior year's ED volume stayed steady at 100,000 visits per week. From January5 to March 28, there were 593 AMI and 791 stroke/TIA visits per week on average. By April 11, EDvisits reached a nadir at 426 AMI and 543 stroke/TIA visits per week, representing a 28% and 31%decrease, respectively. Since June, AMI and stroke/TIA ED visits have rebounded slightly but haveyet to reach pre-pandemic levels. Conclusions: We observed swift declines in AMI and stroke/TIA ED visits following NC's stay-at-home order. These findings potentially reflect the avoidance of medical care due to fears of COVID-19 exposure and may eventually result in higher associated case fatality.","output":"Declines in acute myocardial infarction and stroke emergency department visits observed during covid-19 restrictions in North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we have investigated the binding mechanism of two FDA-approved drugs (ivermectin and levosalbutamol) with the spike protein of SARs-CoV-2 using three different computational modeling techniques.

Ivermectin binds with LEU492, GLN493, GLY496, and TRY505 residues in the spike protein through hydrogen bonds and levosalbutamol binds with TYR453 and TYR505 residues. Using density functional theory (DFT) studies, we have calculated the binding energies between ivermectin and levosalbutamol with residues in spike protein which favor their binding are ? 22.4 kcal/mol and ? 21.08 kcal/mol, respectively. The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis has been performed to estimate the amount of charge transfer that occurred by two drugs during interaction with residues. Molecular dynamics (MD) study confirms the stability of spike protein bound with ivermectin through RMSD and RMSF analyses.

Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes.

Once treated for severe and critical COVID-19 infections, patients are discharged from the hospital for further treatment and rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed comprehensive rehabilitation program based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the rehabilitation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Methods: : We recruited a total of 72 patients who had suffered from severe and critical COVID-19 infections and were undergoing rehabilitation in Chongqing, China. A comprehensive rehabilitation program was formulated according to the TCM syndromes of these patients. Specific treatments included oral TCM, Baduanjin, Moxibustion, Acupoint application, and foot baths. Prior to the initiation of treatment, and four weeks after the initiation of treatment, we carried out a range of assessments, including the TCM Syndrome curative effect score, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the Short Form (SF)-36 Quality of Life Scale, and the 6-minute walking test. We also carried out CT scans, serology tests. Statistical analysis was also conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM on severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Results: : Analysis showed that there were significant differences (P < 0.05) when compared before and after four weeks of TCM treatment, in terms of the TCM syndrome curative effect score, mMRC dyspnea score, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, SF-36 Quality of Life Scale score, and the 6-minute walking test. We also identified significant differences (P < 0.05) between these two timepoints, with regards to the neutrophil ratio, lymphoid cell ratio, lymphocytes, platelets, red blood cells, and hemoglobin. There were no significant differences when compared between the two timepoints with regards to white blood cells and neutrophils (P > 0.05). The efficacy of chest CT scans was 83.9%. Logistic regression showed that the CT scans of patients who did not take the TCM decoction did not improve significantly. The higher a patients score on the 6-minute walking test, the higher the probability of no significant improvement on the CT scan. Conclusions: A comprehensive rehabilitation program based on TCM improved a number of clinical parameters in patients suffering from severe and critical COVID-19 infections, including quality of life, clinical symptoms, exercise endurance, and respiratory function. TCM also enhanced lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, platelet, red blood cell (RBC) count, and hemoglobin content.

Non-invasive methods are essential especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as they minimise the burden on healthcare personnel. One notable symptom of COVID-19 infection is a rapid respiratory rate, which requires constant real-time monitoring of respiratory patterns. In this paper, Software Defined Radio (SDR) based Radio-Frequency sensing technique and supervised machine learning algorithm is employed to provide a platform for detecting and monitoring various respiratory: eupnea, biot, bradypnea, sighing, tachypnea, and kussmaul. The variations in Channel State Information produced by human respiratory were utilised to identify distinct respiratory patterns using fine-grained Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing signals. The proposed platform based on the SDR and the Deep Multilayer Perceptron classifier exhibits the ability to effectively detect and classify the afore-mentioned distinct respiratory with an accuracy of up to 99%. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of diagnosis accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix is demonstrated by comparison with a state-of-the-art machine learning classifier: Random Forest.

Currently, health technology assessment (HTA) tends to be static and a priori: alternatives are compared before launch, and little evaluation occurs after implementation. We suggest a method that builds upon the current pre-launch HTA procedures by conceptualizing a mean-variance approach to the continuous evaluation of attainable portfolios of interventions in health systems. Our framework uses frontier analysis to identify the desirability of available health interventions so decision makers can choose diverse portfolios based upon information about expected returns and risks. This approach facilitates the extension of existing methods and assessments beyond the traditional concern with pre-adoption data, a much-needed innovation given the challenges posed by COVID-19.","output":"Portfolio frontier analysis: Applying mean-variance analysis to health technology assessment for health systems under pressure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of long-term care (LTC) homes have suffered disproportionately during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the virus itself and often from the imposition of lockdown measures. Provincial Geriatrics Leadership Ontario, in collaboration with interRAI and the International Federation on Aging, hosted a virtual Town Hall on September 25, 2020. The purpose of this event was to bring together international perspectives from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts to address important themes potentially amenable to timely policy interventions. This article summarizes these themes and the ensuing discussions among 130 attendees from 5 continents. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frail residents of LTC homes reflects a systematic lack of equitable prioritization by health system decision makers around the world. The primary risk factors for an outbreak in an LTC home were outbreaks in the surrounding community, high staff and visitor traffic in large facilities, and crowding of residents in ageing buildings. Infection control measures must be prioritized in LTC homes, though care must be taken to protect frail and vulnerable residents from their overly blunt application that deprives residents from appropriate physical and psychosocial support. Staffing, in terms of overall numbers, training, and leadership skills, was inadequate. The built environment of LTC homes can be configured for both optimal resident well-being and infection control. Infection control and resident wellness need not be mutually exclusive. Improving outcomes for LTC residents requires more staffing with proper training and interprofessional leadership. All these initiatives must be underpinned by an effective quality assurance system based on standardized, comprehensive, accessible, and clinically relevant data, and which can support broad communities of practice capable of effecting real and meaningful change for frail older persons, wherever they chose to reside.","output":"Proceedings from an International Virtual Townhall: Reflecting on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Themes from Long-Term Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5) is a highly conserved protein that regulates various lipid metabolic pathways via interactions with members of the perilipin (PLIN) and Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein (PNPLA) protein families.

Recent data demonstrates that ABHD5 is the target of synthetic and endogenous ligands that might be therapeutic beneficial for treating metabolic diseases and cancers. However, the structural basis of ABHD5 functional activities, such as proteinCprotein interactions and ligand binding is presently unknown. To address this gap, we constructed theoretical structural models of ABHD5 by comparative modeling and topological shape analysis to assess the spatial patterns of ABHD5 conformations computed in protein dynamics. We identified functionally important residues on ABHD5 surface for lipolysis activation by PNPLA2, lipid droplet targeting and PLIN-binding. We validated the computational model by examining the effects of mutating key residues in ABHD5 on an array of functional assays.

Significant reductions were observed in accesses to the emergency departments (417%), outpatient visits (357%), intensive and non-intensive care unit inpatient admissions (164% and 13%, respectively) between February 1 and April 30, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019. Overall, 93 children with SARS CoV-2 infection were admitted to inpatient wards. All the hospitals created a multidisciplinary planning committee that developed written SARS-CoV-2 infection preparedness plans for the evaluation, diagnosis and management of confirmed or suspected infected patients. Routine activities were re-scheduled or cancelled. Four hospitals shared their own staff with adult units, two designated bed spaces for adults and only one admitted adults to inpatient wards. The three main components of the strategic planning process for the resumption of clinical activities were testing, source control, and reorganization of spaces and flows of patients.

However, some unexpected thrombotic events at unusual sites, most frequently located in the cerebral venous sinus but also splanchnic, with associated thrombocytopenia, have emerged in subjects who received adenovirus-based vaccines, especially in fertile women. This clinical entity was soon recognized as a new syndrome, named vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, probably caused by cross-reacting anti-platelet factor-4 antibodies activating platelets. For this reason, the regulatory agencies of various countries restricted the use of adenovirus-based vaccines to some age groups. The prevailing opinion of most experts, however, is that the risk of developing COVID-19, including thrombotic complications, clearly outweighs this potential risk. This point-of-view aims at providing a narrative review of epidemiological issues, clinical data, and pathogenetic hypotheses of thrombosis linked to both COVID-19 and its vaccines, helping medical practitioners to offer up-to-date and evidence-based counseling to their often-alarmed patients with acute or chronic cardiovascular thrombotic events.","output":"COVID-19, Vaccines, and Thrombotic Events: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Protein or peptide-based subunit vaccines are promising platforms for combating human cancers and infectious diseases. However, one primary concern regarding subunit vaccines is the relatively weak immune responses induced by proteins or peptides. Therefore, developing novel and effective vaccine adjuvants is critical for the success of subunit vaccines. Modified vaccinia virus (MVA) is a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. In this study, we explored the potential of heat-inactivated MVA (heat-iMVA) as a novel vaccine adjuvant. Methods We co-administered heat-iMVA with a model antigen, chicken ovalbumin (OVA), either intramuscularly or subcutaneously twice, two weeks apart, and analyzed anti-OVA specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleens and skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and serum anti-OVA IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies. We also compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with several known vaccine adjuvants, including complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax, an MF59-like preclinical grade nano-emulsion. In addition, we tested whether co-administration of heat-iMVA plus tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells improves antitumor efficacy in a B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination model. Using Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) or Batf3-deficient mice, we evaluated the contribution of the STING pathway and Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8 DCs in heat-iMVA-induced immunity. Results Co-administration of protein- or peptide-based immunogens with heat-iMVA dramatically enhances Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses. This adjuvant effect of heat-iMVA is dependent on the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response requires Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs). Heat-iMVA infection of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) promoted antigen cross-presentation, whereas live MVA infection did not. RNA-seq analyses revealed that heat-iMVA is a more potent activator of the STING pathway than live MVA. Additionally, combining tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells with heat-iMVA delayed tumor growth and extended the median survival in B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination models. Conclusions Heat-iMVA induces type I interferon (IFN) production and antigen cross-presentation via a STING-dependent mechanism in DCs. Co-administration of heat-iMVA with peptide antigen generates strong Th1-biased cellular and humoral immunity.

RESULTS: There was a 39.5% (n = 101 vs n = 167) reduction in admissions in the COVID cohort compared with 2019 with more severe strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 7 vs 4, p = 0.02), and fewer strokes with no visible acute pathology (21.8 vs 37.1%, p = 0.01) on computed tomography. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of thrombolysis (10.9 vs 13.2%, p = 0.72) and/or thrombectomy (5.9 vs 4.8%, p = 0.90) and no statistically significant difference in time from stroke onset to arrival at hospital (734 vs 576 min, p = 0.34), door-to-needle time for thrombolysis (54 vs 64 min, p = 0.43) and door-to-thrombectomy time (181 vs 445 min, p = 0.72). Thirty-day mortality was not significantly higher in the COVID year (10.9 vs 8.9%, p = 0.77). None of the 7 stroke patients infected with COVID-19 died. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of stroke admissions fell, and stroke severity increased. There was no statistically significant change in the delivery of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy and no increase in mortality.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on stroke admissions, treatments, and outcomes at a comprehensive stroke centre in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Widespread vaccination uptake has been shown to be crucial in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences on healthcare infrastructures. Infection numbers, hospitalisation rates and mortality can be mitigated if large parts of the population are being vaccinated. However, one year after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a substantial share of the Swiss population still refrains from being vaccinated. OBJECTIVES: We analysed COVID-19 vaccination uptake during the first 12 months of vaccine availability. We compared vaccination rates of different socioeconomic subgroups (e.g., education, income, migration background) and regions (urban vs rural, language region) and investigated associations between uptake and individual traits such as health literacy, adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures and trust in government or science. METHODS: Our analysis was based on self-reported vaccination uptake of a longitudinal online panel of Swiss adults aged 18 to 79 (the \\"COVID-19 Social Monitor\\", analysis sample n = 2448). The panel is representative for Switzerland with regard to age, gender, and language regions. Participants have been periodically surveyed about various public health issues from 30 March 2020, to 16 December 2021. We report uptake rates and age-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) by population subgroups without and with additional covariate adjustment using Cox regression survival analysis. RESULTS: Higher uptake rates were found for individuals with more than just compulsory schooling (secondary: unadjusted HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.76; tertiary: HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.47), household income above CHF 4999 (5000-9999: unadj. HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.25-1.61; 10,000 HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.72-2.30), those suffering from a chronic condition (unadj. HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.25-1.53), and for individuals with a sufficient or excellent level of health literacy (sufficient: unadj. HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.29; excellent: HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34). We found lower rates for residents of rural regions (unadj. HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.88), those showing less adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures, and those with less trust in government or science. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination uptake is multifactorial and influenced by sociodemographic status, health literacy, trust in institutions and expected risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Fears of unwanted vaccine effects and doubts regarding vaccine effectiveness appear to drive uptake hesitancy and demand special attention in future vaccination campaigns.","output":"Differences in COVID-19 vaccination uptake in the first 12 months of vaccine availability in Switzerland - a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If they undergo new mutations at each replication cycle, why are RNA viral genomes so fragile, with most mutations being either strongly deleterious or lethal? Here we provide theoretical and numerical evidence for the hypothesis that genetic fragility is partly an evolutionary response to the multiple population bottlenecks experienced by viral populations at various stages of their life cycles. Modelling within-host viral populations as multi-type branching processes, we show that mutational fragility lowers the rate at which Mullers ratchet clicks and increases the survival probability through multiple bottlenecks. In the context of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered epidemiological model, we find that the attack rate of fragile viral strains can exceed that of more robust strains, particularly at low infectivities and high mutation rates. Our findings highlight the importance of demographic events such as transmission bottlenecks in shaping the genetic architecture of viral pathogens.","output":"Why are viral genomes so fragile?

By employing a buffer system suitable for crude extraction of nucleic acids together with an impurity-tolerant enzyme, we established a multiplex assay of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for simultaneous detection of ASF virus (ASFV), CSF virus (CSFV) and swine internal control derived genes in a sample without the need for prior purification of viral nucleic acids. We applied this method to test serum and tissue samples of infected pigs and wild boars and compared the statistical sensitivities and specificities with those of standard molecular diagnostic methods. When a serum was used as a test material, the newly established assay showed 94.4% sensitivity for both and 97.9 and 91.9% specificity for ASFV and CSFV detection, respectively. In contrast, the results were 100% identical with those obtained by the standard methods when a crude tissue homogenate was used as a test material.

METHODS The JetStream XC atherectomy device, a rotational cutter with aspiration capacity, was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 29 patients (mean age 69.9  11.7 years; 11 men) with femoropopliteal ISR in 32 limbs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01722877). Lesion length was 17.4  13.1 cm. The primary effectiveness outcome was acute success ( 30% residual narrowing with no serious adverse events). The primary safety endpoint was major adverse events. Secondary endpoints included clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 6 months and 1 year and loss of stent integrity as assessed by an angiographic core laboratory. RESULTS Treated length was 19.5  12.9 cm. Acute success was obtained in 29/32 (91%) limbs. Acute device success (<50% residual narrowing after atherectomy alone) was 76% (22/29). Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in all cases at a mean pressure of 11.6  3.3 atm. Embolic filter protection was used in 16 (50%) of 32 limbs. Macrodebris was noted in 2 (12%) of 16 filters. Distal embolization requiring treatment occurred in 3/32 (9.4%) limbs (2 with no filter). Other non-procedure-related adverse events were 1 (3%) death (nonvascular) and 1 (3%) case of major bleeding. There were no new stent fractures or deformities (n=24) postatherectomy. Follow-up was completed on 27 patients (29 limbs) at 6 and 12 months. TLR at these time points occurred in 4/29 (14%) and 12/29 (41%) patients. Patency (duplex-derived peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4) was 72% at 6 months. CONCLUSION JetStream atherectomy using the XC device has favorable acute results in treating femoropopliteal ISR with high procedure success, no device-stent interaction, and favorably low TLR rates.

This shortage can be attributed to different factors, including the RNA viruses with high mutation rate that would make a large genome more prone to acquire deleterious mutations.

To detect earlier duplications, we performed protein tertiary structure comparisons for every RNA virus family represented in the Protein Data Bank. We present a list of thirty pairs of possible paralogs with <30 per cent sequence identity. It is argued that these pairs are the outcome of six duplication events.

We selected four of the big five species, namely; buffalo (Syncerus caffer), elephant (Loxodonta africana), the leopard (Panthera pardus) and lion (Panthera leo) for analysis. Existing database of 188 trophies from 2009 to 2011 was reviewed and recorded using the Safari Club International (SCI) scoring system. Further, 50 trophies for 2012 were measured and recorded based on the SCI scoring system. Local ecological knowledge on trophy quality and hunting effort in CSSA was obtained through semi-structured questionnaires from 22 conveniently selected professional hunters in 2012. The results indicated no significant change in trophy quality trends of buffalo, leopard and lion (p > 0.05) over the study period. In contrast, there was a significant decline in elephant trophy quality trend over the same period (p < 0.05). The results showed no significant change in hunting effort over the study period for all the four study species (p > 0.05). Furthermore, seventy-two percent (72%, n = 13) of the professional hunters confirmed that elephant population was declining in CSSA and this was likely due to poaching. Professional hunters perceived trophy hunting as a source of financial capital generation for wildlife conservation (61%, n = 11), as well as positively contributing to the local economy (56%, n = 10). It was concluded that hunting has limited negative impact on species trophy quality trends when a sustainable hunting system is consistently followed in CSSA.

An effective means of delaying, preventing, or treating AD is yet to be achieved. The failure rate of dementia drug trials has been relatively higher than in other disease-related clinical trials. Hence, multi-targeted therapeutic approaches are gaining attention in pharmacological developments. AIMS: As an extension of our earlier reports, we have performed docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies for the same 13 potential ligands against beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) and -secretase as a therapeutic target for AD. The In-silico screening of these ligands as potential inhibitors of BACE-1 and -secretase was performed using AutoDock enabled PyRx v-0.8. The protein-ligand interactions were analyzed in Discovery Studio 2020 (BIOVIA). The stability of the most promising ligand against BACE-1 and -secretase was evaluated by MD simulation using Desmond-2018 (Schrodinger, LLC, NY, USA). RESULTS: The computational screening revealed that the docking energy values for each of the ligands against both the target enzymes were in the range of ?7.0 to ?10.1 kcal/mol. Among the 13 ligands, 8 (55E, 6Z2, 6Z5, BRW, F1B, GVP, IQ6, and X37) showed binding energies of ?8 kcal/mol against BACE-1 and -secretase. For the selected enzyme targets, BACE-1 and -secretase, 6Z5 displayed the lowest binding energy of ?10.1 and ?9.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The MD simulation study confirmed the stability of BACE-6Z5 and -secretase-6Z5 complexes and highlighted the formation of a stable complex between 6Z5 and target enzymes. CONCLUSION: The virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed the potential of these multi-enzyme targeted ligands. Among the studied ligands, 6Z5 seems to have the best binding potential and forms a stable complex with BACE-1 and -secretase. We recommend the synthesis of 6Z5 for future in-vitro and in-vivo studies.","output":"Concatenation of molecular docking and molecular simulation of BACE-1, -secretase targeted ligands: in pursuit of Alzheimers treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019?nCoV pandemic represents a high risk for older people that sustain higher mortality rates compared to young adults. Limited social contact and restriction of mobility in the community (stay-at-home precautions) are recognised as measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among older people. The impact of these measures on health, physical function and emotional wellbeing are numerous, and might result in long-term adverse outcomes such as disability, falls and limited mobility. Thus, the objective of this scope review is to map the estimated impact of measures of social restrictions on the mobility of older people living in the community and to systematize the existing recommendations, anticipating possible intervention strategies gaps. Methods: The search will be carried out using a standardized protocol in Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), consulted by the Virtual Health Library (VHL), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), via PubMed;Web of Science, via Main Collection (Thomson Reuters Scientific) and SCOPUS. Documents and reports with recommendations from governmental and nongovernmental organizations will be consulted. Complete studies available in the English, Spanish or Portuguese languages included in the different methodological approaches (original articles, literature reviews, editorials and guidelines) that necessarily address the recommendations of social restriction measures for preventing Covid-19 disease and their impacts on mobility of older people will be included. Two reviewers will select the studies based on their titles and abstracts. The manuscripts and documents selected for full reading will be analysed by reviewers concerning the eligibility criteria. When disagreements occurred in any phase of the selection process, a third reviewer will be included for a consensus analysis. Data will be extracted using a template form and the PRISMA-ScR checklist will be used to guarantee quality and transparency. Results will be presented as a narrative summary, including tables and figures. Discussion: Globally, recommendations to stay-at-home and social distancing are substantially affecting health and wellbeing of older people. Preserving mobility is crucial to active and healthy ageing. The evidence summarized in the selected studies will be analysed in order to answer the research questions. The results of this review will help clinical practitioners, health care providers and policy makers to estimate the impact of measures to protect older people from 2019?nCoV and to identify gaps and anticipate needs for targeted interventions to prevent mobility decline.

Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 98% of malaria cases in Zimbabwe and causes the most severe disease. Abnormal haematological parameters are a frequent finding in patients with malaria; however, they are rarely the sole presenting feature. We present the case of a 32-year-old woman in her fifth pregnancy, with a history of one previous caesarean section, who presented for caesarean section and was incidentally noted to have severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations at a tertiary institution revealed a pancytopenia with thrombocytopenia as the most prominent feature in an asymptomatic patient. The unavoidable caesarean section done under platelet cover was eventful, with severe intractable haemorrhage necessitating an emergency hysterectomy. However, the patient made a full recovery with antimalarial treatment and blood product transfusions. This case is presented to illustrate the need to consider malaria as a differential diagnosis in pregnant patients from malaria-transmitting areas who have thrombocytopenia. Previous studies have shown that thrombocytopenia can be a predictor of malaria in patients who present with fever, and a marker of disease severity, but has no utility in prognostication and follow-up.","output":"Pancytopenia with severe thrombocytopenia in asymptomatic malaria in advanced pregnancy: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding optimal parameter configurations for tunable GPU kernels is a non-trivial exercise for large search spaces, even when automated.

Whether the CT findings could differentiate between the COVID-19 admitted out of Wuhan and common pneumonia has not been investigated. This study aimed to compare the chest CT features of patients with COVID-19 admitted out of Wuhan, as against the patients with common pneumonia. Methods: : This retrospective study enrolled 37 individuals with COVID-19 from six medical centers out of Wuhan from January 17 th to February 26 th . Another group of 41 patients with acute pneumonia collected from the same timeframe in 2019 were enrolled as the control group. All the patients had high-resolution chest CT (HRCT) scans. Clinical variables were recorded including exposure history, clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. For each HRCT, pulmonary lesions including ground-glass opacification (GGO), consolidation, and evidence of fibrosis were recorded. The Students t test or Wilcoxons test was used for comparison between COVID-19 and common pneumonia. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate correlations between the pneumonia findings on CT and clinical variables. Results: : A total of 37 patients (M/F:19/18;43.7316.71 years) in COVID-19 group and 41(M/F:13/28;49.7715.00 years) in common pneumonia group were evaluated. Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated a typical pattern of bilateral, multi-lobal GGO, sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis, but a mild degree of pneumonia findings than the control group ( P = 0.0024). 23/37 (62.16%) patients with COVID-19 had a preferable subpleural distribution, while the patients with common pneumonia had higher frequency of peribronchovascular pattern (16/41, 39.02%, P =0.0046).

We sought to teach open inguinal hernia (OIH) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) anatomy with simulation models among general surgery (GS) interns. METHODS Low-fidelity OIH and TEP models were constructed out of cardboard, plastic bins, fabric, and yarn. GS interns (n = 30) participated in a 3-h hernia session including a pretest, anatomy lecture, simulated OIH and TEP hernia repair, and posttest. Pre- and posttest scores were based on a difficult 30-point exam which included didactic questions (10 points), drawing relevant TEP (10 points), and OIH (10 points) anatomy. Participants were surveyed following the session. RESULTS Median pretest scores were 13 % (range 0-60 %). Median posttest scores improved to 47 % (range 20-93 %, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the TEP image improved from 2 (range 0-14) to 11 (range 1-21, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the OIH image improved from 3 (range 0-15) to 7 (range 1-19, p < 0.001). 67 % (12/18) demonstrated improvement in knowledge of abdominal wall layers. 23 % (7/30) knew the triangles of pain/doom on the pretest vs. 77 % (23/30) on the posttest. Mean Likert scores favored session enjoyability (4.5), not a waste of training time (4.4), and improved understanding of OIH and TEP anatomy (4.4, 4.2). CONCLUSIONS Low-fidelity simulators can be used to teach and assess knowledge of TEP and OIH anatomy.

However, the effects of the current emergency and imposed social distancing measures have only exacerbated the underlying vulnerabilities of the transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) population made bare during these other recent disasters. Clinics and providers who treat patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in Puerto Rico have had to develop their own safety protocols to limit the spread of the virus while trying to optimize current treatment protocols to maintain the stability of their patients. Despite these measures, we have observed a reduction in the ability of local organizations to outreach to already disconnected transgender and GNC individuals with OUD. For example, due to the government-imposed curfew that began March 15, 2020, some providers engaged in outreach with transgender and GNC sex workers have eliminated nighttime outreach completely. Additionally, a research project surveying all buprenorphine prescribers in Puerto Rico has found that few have received training in treating this vulnerable population, and even fewer report that they are currently providing treatment for transgender or GNC individuals.

Since 2013, we have followed the study use of iPads among medical students. In 2016, we observed a notable drop in the mobile device usage in the first cohort of medical students entering their clinical courses. METHODS: The aim of the study was to identify the hurdles for adopting mobile devices at the beginning of the clinical courses. We examined how students evaluated their own and the clinical teachers ability to use the iPad, how the study assignments fit into digital learning, and how students used the mobile device with patients. The data were collected with online surveys among three consecutive student cohorts and the distributions of closed-ended questions analyzed. RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 67.5 to 90.8%. Students evaluated their own ability to use the iPad as good or excellent and teachers skills as relatively poor and wanted more digitally tailored assignments. They reported negative attitudes towards mobile device use in the clinical setting and were hesitant to use them in patient contact. Teachers seldom communicated suitable quality medical applications to students. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical teachers need support and training to implement a learning environment and assignments appropriate for mobile devices.

The chapter discusses the way by which host genes, acting through a variety of mechanisms, can influence the susceptibility or resistance of animals to neurotropic viruses. It also reviews investigations concerning the role played by individual viral genes and the proteins they encode in determining specific pathways of viral spread to the central nervous system in the infected host. The chapter presents several examples illustrating the current state of knowledge concerning the nature of viral cell attachment proteins and host cell receptors for neurotropic viruses.

METHODS Dog sputum models were established by administering dimethoate emulsifiable. Twenty-seven intubated dogs were equally randomized into three groups of conventional suctioning (CS) group, VSSS with no supplemental oxygen (VSSS) group and VSSS with 100% oxygen (VSSS/O2) group. The suctioning efficiency, vital signs and tracheal wall injury were assessed. RESULTS The VSSS/O2 (8.6  0.7g) and VSSS groups (8.5  0.9 g) collected significantly more sputum than the CS group (5.9  0.8 g) (P < 0.05 for VSSS/O2 group versus CS group; P < 0.05 for VSSS group versus CS group). Immediately after suctioning, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) of VSSS/O2 group was significantly higher than that of the VSSS group or the CS group (both P < 0.05), and 5 min after suction the PaO2 , the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in all groups returned to the baseline (p = 0.54, P = 0.67, P = 0.11, respectively). Moreover, in the VSSS/O2 and VSSS groups all the three variables were higher than the CS group at 5 min after suctioning (P < 0.01, P = 0.03; P = 0.02, P < 0.01; P = 0.02, P = 0.01 respectively).

Methods for visualizing BC include mammography, MR imaging, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine-based methods such as (99m)Tc-sestamibi and (18)F-FDG PET, unfortunately all lacking specificity. Peptide receptor scintigraphy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are successfully applied for imaging and therapy of somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors using somatostatin receptor radioligands. On the basis of a similar rationale, radioligands targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) might offer a specific method for imaging and therapy of BC. The aim of this study was to explore the application of GRP-R radioligands for imaging and therapy of BC by introducing valid preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. METHODS GRP-R expression of 50 clinical BC specimens and the correlation with ER expression was studied by in vitro autoradiography with the GRP-R agonist (111)In-AMBA. GRP-R expression was also analyzed in 9 BC cell lines applying (111)In-AMBA internalization assays and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In vitro cytotoxicity of (177)Lu-AMBA was determined on the GRP-R-expressing BC cell line T47D. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution were studied in mice with subcutaneous and orthotopic ER-positive T47D and MCF7 xenografts after injection of the GRP-R antagonist (111)In-JMV4168. RESULTS Most of the human BC specimens (96%) and BC cell lines (6/9) were found to express GRP-R. GRP-R tumor expression was positively (P = 0.026, (2)(4) = 12,911) correlated with ER expression in the human BC specimens. Treatment of T47D cells with 10(-7) M/50 MBq of (177)Lu-AMBA resulted in 80% reduction of cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors from both BC cell lines were successfully visualized in vivo by SPECT/CT using (111)In-JMV4168; T47D tumors exhibited a higher uptake than MCF7 xenografts.

Meanwhile, local patient isolates were also selected to confirm the epidemiological links. Bacterial community composition analyses of the sediments that were sampled in 2015 and 2017 were conducted by the hypervariable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene. Together with the local clinical isolates, we observed highly related Vibrio isolates from waterbirds, wetlands and shrimp. Phylogenetic genome comparisons also demonstrated that sequence types ST3 and ST2414 Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates obtained from aquatic animals were clonally related to patient isolates. Likewise, three Salmonella typhimurium isolates were also genomically related to one clinical strain. The results showed that farming activities significantly altered the community composition and resulted in the emergence of several pathogens, including Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium and Legionella.

METHOD: One hundred and sixty-six pregnant women with SPE were randomly divided into an experimental group and control group, with 83 cases in each group. The control group was given conventional treatments such as magnesium sulfate, and the experimental group received self-made traditional Chinese medicine decoction for oral administration. RESULTS: The total clinical effective rate of treatment in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group. After treatment, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and 24 h proteinuria (24 h PRO) levels of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group. After cesarean section (c-section) under combined lumbar and epidural anesthesia, there were statistically significant differences in placental abruption, uterine weakness, fetal intrauterine distress, and neonatal asphyxia in the experimental group, while there were no significant differences in oligohydramnios. After treatment, the contents of inflammatory factors in both groups decreased, and the decrease was more prominent in the experimental group. After treatment, the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and albumin (Alb) and 2 microglobulin (2-MG) of the two groups of patients decreased, and the levels of them in the experimental group decreased. After treatment, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the two groups increased. However, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) all reduced, and the increase or decrease in the experimental group was more prominent. CONCLUSION: The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can reduce the blood pressure of a patient with SPE.

Given the similar clinical features in both diseases, it is necessary to identify biomarkers that can differentiate COVID-19 from AOSD. However, the related data remain scarce currently. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma levels of galectin-3, galectin-9, and soluble TIM-3 (sTIM-3) were determined by ELISA in 55 COVID-19 patients (31 non-severe and 24 severe), 23 active AOSD patients, and 31 healthy controls (HC). The seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was examined using an immunochromatographic assay, and cytokine profiles were determined with the MULTIPLEX platform. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of galectin-3, galectin-9, IL-1, IL-1Ra, IL-10, IFN-2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF- were observed in severe COVID-19 and active AOSD patients compared with HC (all p<0.001). AOSD, but not COVID-19, showed significantly higher IFN- and IL-17A compared with HC (both p<0.01). Moreover, active AOSD patients had 68-fold higher IL-18 levels and 5-fold higher ferritin levels than severe COVID-19 patients (both p<0.001). IL-18 levels at the cut-off value 190.5pg/mL had the highest discriminative power for active AOSD and severe COVID-19, with AUC 0.948, sensitivity 91.3%, specificity 95.8%, and accuracy of 91.5% (p<0.005). Multivariate regression analysis revealed IL-18 as a significant predictor of active AOSD (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Active AOSD patients share features of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm with severe COVID-19 patients but possess a distinct cytokine profile, including elevated IL-18, IL-6, IFN-, and IL-17A.

This paper analyzes the weekend-weekday differences of O(3) at 300 rural and 808 urban background stations worldwide from 2005 to 2014, in order to investigate the O(3) weekend effect over time and assess the effectiveness of the precursors emissions control policies for reducing O(3) levels. Data were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen estimator. Rural sites typically did not experience a weekend-weekday effect. In all urban stations, the mean O(3) concentration on the weekend was 12% higher than on weekdays.

Over this time period, emissions of O(3) precursors declined significantly. However, a greater decline in nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) emissions caused an increase in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to NO(x) ratios leading to O(3) formation.

This allowed institutions to continue their instruction despite not being in person. However, ERT is not without consequences. For example, students may have inadequate technological supports, such as reliable internet and computers. Students may also have poor learning environments at home and may need to find added employment to support their families. In addition, there are consequences to faculty. It has been shown that female instructors are more disproportionately impacted in terms of mental health issues and increased domestic labor. This research aims to investigate instructors and students perceptions of their transition to ERT. Specifically, during the transition to ERT at a research-intensive, Minority-Serving Institution (MSI), we wanted to: (1) Identify supports and barriers experienced by instructors and students. (2) Compare instructors experiences with the students experiences. (3) Explore these supports and barriers within the context of social presence, teaching presence, and/or cognitive presence as well as how these supports and barriers relate to scaffolding in STEM courses. RESULTS: Instructors identified twice as many barriers as supports in their teaching during the transition to ERT and identified casual and formal conversations with colleagues as valuable supports. Emerging categories for barriers consisted of academic integrity concerns as well as technological difficulties. Similarly, students identified more barriers than supports in their learning during the transition to ERT. More specifically, students described pre-existing course structure, classroom technology, and community as best supporting their learning. Barriers that challenged student learning included classroom environment, student availability, and student emotion and comfort. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this research will help us understand supports and barriers to teaching and learning during the transition to ERT. This understanding can help us better plan and prepare for future emergencies, particularly at MSIs, where improved communication and increased access to resources for both students and instructors are key.

Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.","output":"Collection of Viable Aerosolized Influenza Virus and Other Respiratory Viruses in a Student Health Care Center through Water-Based Condensation Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital-acquired infections are on the rise and are a substantial cause of clinical and financial burden for healthcare systems.

Prior laparoscopic IHR experience did not affect 30-day outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Obese patients who undergo RHR have a lower rate of postoperative complications compared to obese patients who undergo OHR. Previous laparoscopic IHR experience, more bilateral repairs, and more concomitant procedures were not associated with increased complications in RHR patients. These outcomes may facilitate increased adoption of minimally invasive IHR approaches in the obese population.","output":"Early outcomes of robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair in obese patients: a multi-institutional, retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 patients with underlying rheumatic diseases (RD) on immunosuppressive agents. METHOD: A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. RESULTS: There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57  21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNF&#945; inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% CONCLUSION: Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNF&#945; antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease.

Virus-antiserum neutralisation assays are typically performed to monitor potential vaccine breakthrough strains. However, such experimental-based methods are slow and cannot instantly validate whether newly emerging variants can break through current vaccines or therapeutic antibodies. To address this, we sought to establish a computational model to predict the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants by sequence alone and in real time. In this study, we firstly identified the relationship between the antigenic difference transformed from the amino acid sequence and the antigenic distance from the neutralisation titres. Based on this correlation, we obtained a computational model for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to predict the fold decrease in virus-antiserum neutralisation titres with high accuracy (~0.79). Our predicted results were comparable with experimental neutralisation titres of variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.429 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), and C.37 (Lambda), as well as SARS-CoV. Here, we firstly predicted the fold of decrease of B.1.1.529 (Omicron) as 17.4-fold less susceptible to neutralisation. We visualised all 1521 SARS-CoV-2 lineages to indicate variants including B.1.621 (Mu), B.1.630, B.1.633, B.1.649, and C.1.2, which can induce vaccine breakthrough infections in addition to reported VOCs B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). Our study offers a quick approach to predict the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants as soon as they emerge.

To address concerns of misuse, the antibiotic stewardship unit (ASU) expanded prospective audit feedback (PAF) to CA ARI patients admitted to ARI wards, with low procalcitonin (PCT). PAF was conducted on day 2-3 of ABx, on weekdays. Doctors received feedback to stop/modify when ABx was deemed inappropriate. Here, we describe the impact of ASUs adaptive approach to curb rising ABx use in patients admitted for ARI during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Pre- & Post-intervention study was conducted. All patients started on ABx (ceftriaxone/co-amoxiclav/piptazo/carbapenems/levofloxacin) for CA ARI & PCT < 0.5g/L were analysed. Those who died 48h of admission; admitted to intensive care; required ABx escalation; >1 infective sites; complex lung infection were excluded. Primary objective was to compare the proportion of ABx stopped 4 days (time to final infection diagnosis) Pre (22/3-18/4/20) & Post (21/4-13/7/20). RESULTS: 184 (Pre) & 528 (Post) ABx courses were analysed. ASU audited 51 (Pre) & 380 (Post) courses with the rest discontinued/discharged before review. Patients were largely similar in both periods; a third had low likelihood of bacterial infection (C reactive protein < 30mg/L). In Post, 73 feedback was given to stop ABx (often because symptoms suggested viral/fluid overload) & 18 to switch to oral ABx. 82 (90%) feedback was accepted. No ABx was restarted 48h or deaths 30 days due to ARI. 1 patient had C. difficile diarrhoea a day after ABx cessation as per ASU feedback. Proportion of all ABx stopped 4 days was higher in Post than Pre [27/184 (15%) vs 152/528 (29%), p< 0.01]. Median duration of therapy of IV ABx was reduced (6.5 vs 3 days, p< 0.01), with corresponding shorter median length of stay (10.5 vs 6 days, p< 0.01). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: PAF directly and indirectly reduced ABx duration in patients treated for CA ARI as prescribers become more conscious about stopping ABx when investigations show low likelihood of bacterial infection.

Many critically ill patients are unable to swallow and need oral medications to be delivered via a nasogastric (NG) tube. Furthermore, critically ill patients are typically administered proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to prevent stress ulcers. Concomitant administration with PPIs reduces acalabrutinib exposure and is not currently recommended. To evaluate acalabrutinib in subjects co-administered with PPIs who require NG delivery, a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, crossover, single-dose study was conducted in healthy subjects. METHODS: The study assessed the relative bioavailability of an acalabrutinib suspension-in regular, degassed Coca-Cola?-administered via NG tube (Acala-NG) versus the pharmacokinetics (PK) of an acalabrutinib capsule administered orally with water. In addition, the PPI effect was evaluated by comparing the PK following Acala-NG in the presence or absence of rabeprazole. RESULTS: Exposure of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite (ACP-5862) were comparable following administration of Acala-NG versus the oral capsule (Geo mean ratio, % ref [90% CI]: acalabrutinib AUCinf : 103 [93-113]; Cmax : 144 [120-173]).

As a necessity, there is a need to track users who came in contact with users having travel history, asymptomatic and not yet symptomatic, but they can be in the future. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a solution for contact tracing based on assisted GPS and cloud computing technologies. An application is developed to collect each user's assisted GPS coordinates once all the users install this application. This application periodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices are within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS coordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of spread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an infected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure stores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus, every user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the\\"seconds\\"part of the assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in latitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to the same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we can find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least t mins. Our work's salient feature is that it runs in linear time O(n) for n users in the static case, i.e., when users are not moving. We also propose a variant of our solution to handle the dynamic case, that is, when users are moving.

This study measures the public support for policies designed to increase housing stability and gauges whether support levels are associated with views about the role of evictions in COVID-19 transmission and the existence of racial inequities in the housing market. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of U.S. adults in November 2020 assessed support for 4 housing policies. Logistic regression models estimated the adjusted levels of support for each policy, with separate models testing the association with whether or not a respondent recognized the role of evictions in increased COVID-19 transmission or acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market. RESULTS: Most U.S. adults supported policies aimed to increase housing stability during the COVID-19 pandemic, including extending moratoriums on evictions (63%) and foreclosures (67%) and increasing emergency rental assistance (63%). In total, 54% supported increased government spending on housing vouchers. Adults who agreed that averting eviction would slow COVID-19 transmission had higher support for housing stability policies, as did those who agreed that it was easier for White families to find affordable, high-quality housing than Black families. CONCLUSIONS: Support for housing stability policies was strong among U.S. adults, particularly among those who agreed that preventing evictions slowed COVID-19 transmission and among those who acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market.

RAS was initially related to regulation of blood pressure and sodium and water homeostasis. However, local or paracrine RAS were later identified in many tissues, including brain, and play a major role in their physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, a major component, ACE2, is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Overactivation of tissue RAS leads several oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in aging-related degenerative changes. In addition, a third level of RAS, the intracellular or intracrine RAS (iRAS), with still unclear functions has been observed. The possible interaction between the intracellular and extracellular RAS, and particularly the possible deleterious or beneficial effects of the iRAS activation are controversial. The dopaminergic system is particularly interesting to investigate the RAS as important functional interactions between dopamine and RAS have been observed in the brain and several peripheral tissues. Our recent observations in mitochondria and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons may clarify the role of the iRAS. This may be important for the developing of new therapeutic strategies, since the effects on both extracellular and intracellular RAS must be taken into account, and perhaps better understanding of COVID-19 cell mechanisms.","output":"The intracellular renin-angiotensin system: Friend or foe.

To date, hundreds of millions of COVID-19 tests have been performed globally, but the demand for timely, accurate testing continues to outstrip supply. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing is emerging as an alternative to RT-PCR. However, the performance of these tests, namely their sensitivity, is still inadequate.

Many of these events are asymptomatic and identified only on diffusion-weighted imaging. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events following endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A comprehensive literature search identified studies published between 2000 and April 2016 that reported postprocedural DWI findings in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The primary outcome was the incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events. We examined outcomes by treatment type, sex, and aneurysm characteristics. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effects model. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with 2148 patients and 2268 aneurysms were included. The overall incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events following endovascular treatment was 49% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Treatment with flow diversion trended toward a higher rate of DWI positive for lesions than coiling alone (67%; 95% CI, 46%-85%; versus 45%; 95% CI, 33%-56%; P = .07). There was no difference between patients treated with coiling alone and those treated with balloon-assisted (44%; 95% CI, 29%-60%; P = .99) or stent-assisted (43%; 95% CI, 24%-63%; P = .89) coiling.

When the subscales of the WCI were examined, mean scores were found to be 13.64  4.85 for the self-confident approach, 8.91  3.35 for the optimistic approach, 7.25  2.24 for the seeking social support approach, 10.97  4.43 for the helpless approach, and 6.24  3.20 for the submissive approach. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nursing students have low levels of obsession with COVID-19 and moderate levels of coping behaviors. For this reason, it is very important to recognize the psychological symptoms of today's nursing students-the health workforce of the future-and to determine priorities for their solution.","output":"Analysis of nursing students' obsessive and coping behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measurement of blood flow in tissue provides vital information for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of various vascular diseases. A noncontact, camera-based, near-infrared speckle contrast diffuse correlation tomography (scDCT) technique has been recently developed for 3D imaging of blood flow index (DB) distributions in deep tissues up to a centimeter. A limitation with the continuous-wave scDCT measurement of blood flow is the assumption of constant and homogenous tissue absorption coefficient ( a ). The present study took the advantage of rapid, high-density, noncontact scDCT measurements of both light intensities and diffuse speckle contrast at multiple source-detector distances and developed two-step fitting algorithms for extracting both  a and DB. The new algorithms were tested in tissue-simulating phantoms with known optical properties and human forearms. Measurement results were compared against established near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) techniques. The accuracies of our new fitting algorithms with scDCT measurements in phantoms (up to 16% errors) and forearms (up to 23% errors) are comparable to relevant study results (up to 25% errors). Knowledge of  a not only improved the accuracy in calculating DB but also provided the potential for quantifying tissue blood oxygenation via spectral measurements. A multiple-wavelength scDCT system with new algorithms is currently developing to fit multi-wavelength and multi-distance data for 3D imaging of both blood flow and oxygenation distributions in deep tissues.","output":"Extraction of tissue optical property and blood flow from speckle contrast diffuse correlation tomography (scDCT) measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study intends to examine the cause-and-effect relationship between Covid-19 and the factors affecting investment behavior in a South Asian economy. The investment behavior is considered as an MCDM problem. To address this problem, the study employs MCDM approach i.e., a blend of both DEMATEL and Grey theory due to its potential to deal with subjective judgments of investors. The results indicate that Covid-19 is the leading cause behind financial stress, psychophysiological health outcomes, investors' perception about the market, and investors' strategy. Among sub-factors, portfolio allocation is the most influenced sub-factor. Alteration in portfolio is a major challenge for emerging countries which have become attractive destinations for global investors. Overall, the significant contribution of the paper is to establish the interlinkages among the factors affecting investment behavior, given the uncertainty triggered by the pandemic. Although the literature provides evidence on this problem during normal situations, analysis of investment behavior during severe crisis is still lacking. The research will be immensely useful to different stakeholders such as government, policymakers, financial advisors, and investors in making their strategic or operational decisions.","output":"Modeling of factors affecting investment behavior during the pandemic: a grey-DEMATEL approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses spread unscrupulously virtually every corner on the planet in a very quick speed leading to an unprecedented world pandemic of COVID-19 claiming a great many of people's life Paramount importance has been given to the studies on the virus itself including genomic variation and viron structure, as well as cell entry pathway and tissue residence Other than that, to learn the main characteristic of host immunity responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection is an eminent task for restraining virus and controlling disease progress Beside antibody production in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, host cellular immunity plays an indispensable role in impeding virus replication and expansion at various stages of COVID-19 disease In this review, we summarized the recent knowledge regarding the aberrant regulation and dysfunction of multiple immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection This includes the dysregulation of immune cell number, Th polarity, cytokine storm they implicated with, as well as cell function exhaustion after chronic virus stimulation Notwithstanding that many obstacles remain to be overcome, studies on immunotherapy for COVID-19 treatment based on the known features of host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection offer us tangible benefits and hope for making this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic under control","output":"Cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, the novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout the world and poses new challenges to ensure the health and safety of health personnel Because health personnel are at the frontlines in the fight against the novel coronavirus, which is one of the groups most affected and vulnerable during the pandemic, it is necessary to remind that the preventive measures adopted by health personnel are essential Especially in emergency situations, essential measures must be taken to prevent occupational exposure during the novel coronavirus pandemic Health professionals are working with great intensity and enormous social responsibility In addition to the applause, they deserve more attention Al dia de hoy, el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 se ha extendido ampliamente por el mundo y plantea nuevos desafios para garantizar la salud y seguridad del personal sanitario Debido a que dicho personal esta en primera linea de la lucha contra el nuevo coronavirus, siendo uno de los grupos mas afectados y vulnerables durante la pandemia, es necesario tener en cuenta que las medidas preventivas adoptadas por ellos son fundamentales Especialmente en situaciones de emergencia, hay que tomar las medidas imprescindibles para la prevencion de la exposicion ocupacional durante esta nueva pandemia Los profesionales sanitarios estan trabajando con una gran intensidad y una enorme responsabilidad social pero, ademas de los aplausos, merecen mas atencion","output":"[Important aspects of prevention of health personnel in hospitals during the epidemic novel coronavirus 2019.]/ Aspectos importantes de prevencion del personal sanitario en los hospitales durante la epidemia del nuevo coronavirus 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are the most effective medical intervention due to their continual success in preventing infections and improving mortality worldwide.

This dynamic and global approach to health control is necessary to deal with the new paradigm of living with an infectious disease, which disrupts our individual freedom and behaviors. The challenge for policymakers consists of defining methods of lockdown-lifting and follow-up (middle-term rules) that best meet the needs for resumption of economic activity, societal wellbeing, and containment of the outbreak. There is no simple and ready-to-use way to do this since it means considering several competing objectives at the same time and continuously adapting the strategy and rules, ideally at local scale. We propose a framework for creating a precision evidence-based health policy that simultaneously considers public health, economic, and societal dimensions while accounting for constraints and uncertainty. It is based on the four following principles: integrating multiple and heterogeneous information, accepting navigation with uncertainty, adjusting the strategy dynamically with feedback mechanisms, and managing clusters through a multi-scalar conception. The evidence-based policy intervention for COVID-19 obtained includes scientific background via epidemiological modeling and bio-economic modeling. A set of quantitative and qualitative indicators are used as feedback to precisely monitor the societal-economic-epidemiological dynamics, allowing tightening or loosening of measures before epidemic damage (re-)occurs.

The novel virus inflames the lungs similarly to Pneumonia, making it challenging to diagnose. Currently, the common standard to diagnose the virus's presence from an individual is using a molecular real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test from fluids acquired through nasal swabs. Such a test is difficult to acquire in most underdeveloped countries with a few experts that can perform the test. As a substitute, the widely available Chest X-Ray (CXR) became an alternative to rule out the virus. However, such a method does not come easy as the virus still possesses unknown characteristics that even experienced radiologists and other medical experts find difficult to diagnose through CXRs. Several studies have recently used computer-aided methods to automate and improve such diagnosis of CXRs through Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), which some require heavy processing costs and other tedious methods to produce. Therefore, this work proposed the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny, a lightweight DCNN model based on a densely connected neural network (DenseNet) truncated and concatenated. The model trained to learn CXR features based on transfer learning, partial layer freezing, and feature fusion. Upon evaluation, the proposed model achieved a remarkable 97.99 % accuracy, with only 1.2 million parameters and a shorter end-to-end structure.

Circulating soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE2)2, the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, together with components of the renin-angiotensin system promote infection and disease severity. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study followed the time-course of sACE2 levels in relation to systemic cytokines in severe and moderate COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir/dexamethasone in combination. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained upon admission from 30 patients (12 with moderate disease and 18 with severe disease) and 14 patients with PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Severe and moderate patients were treated with remdesivir (200mg/first day and 100mg/day for the remaining days) and dexamethasone (100mg/day). 6 healthy control subjects (HC) were also enrolled. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and sACE2 levels were measured by ELISA at baseline and during treatment in severe and moderate patients and at baseline in mild and HCs. RESULTS: Baseline sACE2 levels were lower in severe (p=0.0005) and moderate (p=0.0022) patients than in patients with mild COVID-19 and in HC (p=0.0023 and p=0.0012 respectively). Treatment significantly increased sACE2 levels in patients with moderate disease (p=0.0156) but only 50% of patients with severe disease showed enhanced levels compared to baseline. Systemic IL-6 and IL-8 levels were higher in all patient groups compared with HC and were not significantly affected over time or by remdesivir/dexamethasone treatment for 5 days. Conclusion: Serum sACE2 levels increase in severe COVID-19 patients as they recover over time whilst circulating cytokines are unaffected. Future studies should link these results to clinical outcomes.","output":"Decreased serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and enhanced cytokine levels with severity of COVID-19: normalisation upon disease recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equine influenza (EI) virus is one of the most economically important pathogens of respiratory diseases of horses worldwide. Despite availability of vaccines for control of EI, the highly contagious nature and variability properties of the virus mean global outbreaks occur. Thus, continuous surveillance programs, including seroprevalence studies of disease in different countries, may contribute to better control of the disease. In this study, the seroprevalence of equine influenza in 850 horses from Brazil was investigated. The serodiagnosis was based on the single radial hemolysis (SRH) assay using influenza A/equine/Richmond/1/2007 (H3N8) antigen. Antibodies against A/equine/Richmond/1/07 (H3N8) were detected in 44.7% (380/850, 95% CI: 41.4C48.1%) of horses. Seroprevalence was significantly lower (p = 0.001) in younger animals (< 5 years, 38.6%) than in adult animals (5C14 years, 52.1%). There was also a significant relationship between the year of sampling and seroprevalence (p < 0.0005). The mean SRH antibody value was 42.0 mm(2) (range 4C238.9 mm(2)), with the majority of horses (95.3%) having an SRH value  150 mm(2), which is considered an insufficient level for protection of equine hosts against influenza infections and potential virus shedding.

This review summarizes the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission pathways, high-risk factors, diagnostic points, pathogenesis, and therapeutic drugs to provide the prevention and treatment theories for COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 is highly contagious and is transmitted mainly through the respiratory tract. Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have milder symptoms. Some patients will have mild disease in the early stage, suddenly exacerbate later, and eventually die of multiple organ failure caused by cytokine storm. The basis for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is not just the detection of viral nucleic acids as the gold standard. The diagnostic accuracy improves when viral nucleic acid test is combined with clinical symptoms, CT results, and biochemical tests. For the treatment of COVID-19, the specific antiviral agents have not been developed, except for symptomatic supportive treatments. SUMMARY: The methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly mature, but specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 have not yet been developed.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-nine eyes of 69 patients with successfully reattached macula-off RRD were retrospectively analyzed. Six radial spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images were used to evaluate the effects of the ICCs on detached macula and to measure the angle of the retina at the macula as a parameter to evaluate the anterior protrusion of the detached retina. The findings were compared to other parameters. RESULTS: The mean angle of the retina at the macula was 143.1  15.9 with a range of 108 to 172. Preoperatively, 51 eyes (74%) had ICCs in the inner nuclear layer and/or the outer plexiform layer and Henle fiber layer complex, but none was present after surgery.

Anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported by 61%, 59%, 37%, and 34% of participants, respectively. Most participants (79%) reported having received treatment for CIM, and 64% of participants recalled chemotherapy dose modifications as a result of CIM. Although most participants believed their oncologist was aware of the side effects of CIM, and treated them quickly, 30% of participants felt their oncologists did not understand how uncomfortable they were due to the side effects of CIM. Overall, 88% of participants considered CIM to have a moderate or major impact on their lives. CONCLUSION: The data highlight that despite the various methods used to address CIM, and the patient-focused approach of oncologists, the real-world impact of CIM on patients is substantial. Improving communication between patients and health care providers may help improve patients understanding of CIM, and foster shared decision-making in terms of treatment. Additional insights from patients should be obtained to further elucidate the totality of life burden associated with CIM.","output":"Patient Burden and Real-World Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Myelosuppression: Results from an Online Survey of Patients with Solid Tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radon inhalation decreases the level of lipid peroxide (LPO); this is attributed to the activation of antioxidative functions. This activation contributes to the beneficial effects of radon therapy, but there are no studies on the risks of radon therapy, such as DNA damage. We evaluated the effect of radon inhalation on DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and explored the underlying mechanisms. Mice were exposed to radon inhalation at concentrations of 2 or 20 kBq/m3 (for one, three, or 10 days). The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels decreased in the brains of mice that inhaled 20 kBq/m3 radon for three days and in the kidneys of mice that inhaled 2 or 20 kBq/m3 radon for one, three or 10 days. The 8-OHdG levels in the small intestine decreased by approximately 20-40% (2 kBq/m3 for three days or 20 kBq/m3 for one, three or 10 days), but there were no significant differences in the 8-OHdG levels between mice that inhaled a sham treatment and those that inhaled radon. There was no significant change in the levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, which plays an important role in DNA repair. However, the level of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 15-60% and 15-45% in the small intestine and kidney, respectively, following radon inhalation. These results suggest that Mn-SOD probably plays an important role in the inhibition of oxidative DNA damage.","output":"Radon inhalation decreases DNA damage induced by oxidative stress in mouse organs via the activation of antioxidative functions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in digital platforms as a means of implementing scalable, accessible, and cost-effective mental health interventions in the workplace. However, little is known about the efficacy of such interventions when delivered to employee groups. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital mental health platform for the workplace, which incorporates evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. A total of 3 brief, unguided interventions designed to address stress, anxiety, and resilience, respectively, are evaluated. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the study methods and interventions in preparation for a definitive randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The study used a fully remote, parallel, multi-arm, external pilot randomized controlled trial, with 3 intervention arms and a no-intervention control group. Participants were working adults representative of the general UK population with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity who were recruited from a web-based participant platform. Primary outcomes included objective and self-report measures of feasibility, acceptability, engagement, transferability, relevance, and negative effects. Secondary outcomes included 4 self-report measures of mental health and well-being, completed at baseline (time point 0 [t0]), postintervention (time point 1 [t1]), and the 1-month follow-up (time point 2 [t2]). Secondary outcomes were analyzed via linear mixed-effects models using intention-to-treat principles. Preregistered criteria for progression to a definitive trial were evaluated. RESULTS: Data were collected between January and March of 2021. A total of 383 working adult participants meeting trial eligibility were randomized, of whom 356 (93%) were retained at t2. Objective engagement data showed that 67.8% (196/289) of participants randomized to an intervention arm completed their intervention. Overall, 87.1% (203/233) of participants reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their intervention and rated the quality of their intervention as good or excellent. All intervention groups reported significantly greater improvements than the control group on at least one secondary outcome at t1, with between-group Hedges g effect sizes for the pooled interventions ranging from 0.25 (95% CI 0.05-0.46) to 0.43 (95% CI 0.23-0.64). All the improvements were maintained at t2. CONCLUSIONS: The study methods were feasible, and all preregistered criteria for progression to a definitive trial were met. Several minor protocol amendments were noted. Preliminary efficacy findings suggest that the study interventions may result in improved mental health outcomes when offered to working adults.

Due to its time and cost efficiency, drug repositioning plays an instrumental role in optimizing the drug development process compared to the traditional de novo drug discovery process. Advances in the genomics, together with the enormous growth of large-scale publicly available data and the availability of high-performance computing capabilities, have further motivated the development of computational drug repositioning approaches. More recently, the rise of machine learning techniques, together with the availability of powerful computers, has made the area of computational drug repositioning an area of intense activities. RESULTS: In this study, a novel framework SNF-NN based on deep learning is presented, where novel drug-disease interactions are predicted using drug-related similarity information, disease-related similarity information, and known drug-disease interactions. Heterogeneous similarity information related to drugs and disease is fed to the proposed framework in order to predict novel drug-disease interactions. SNF-NN uses similarity selection, similarity network fusion, and a highly tuned novel neural network model to predict new drug-disease interactions. The robustness of SNF-NN is evaluated by comparing its performance with nine baseline machine learning methods. The proposed framework outperforms all baseline methods ([Formula: see text] = 0.867, and [Formula: see text] =0.876) using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. To further demonstrate the reliability and robustness of SNF-NN, two datasets are used to fairly validate the proposed frameworks performance against seven recent state-of-the-art methods for drug-disease interaction prediction. SNF-NN achieves remarkable performance in stratified 10-fold cross-validation with [Formula: see text] ranging from 0.879 to 0.931 and [Formula: see text] from 0.856 to 0.903. Moreover, the efficiency of SNF-NN is verified by validating predicted unknown drug-disease interactions against clinical trials and published studies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, computational drug repositioning research can significantly benefit from integrating similarity measures in heterogeneous networks and deep learning models for predicting novel drug-disease interactions.

We hypothesized that the injured muscle fibers release pro-inflammatory molecules, which would further accelerate CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes-induced muscle injury, and inhibition of the cell death of muscle fibers could be a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress both muscle injury and inflammation in polymyositis. Here, we show that the pattern of cell death of muscle fibers in polymyositis is FAS ligand-dependent necroptosis, while that of satellite cells and myoblasts is perforin 1/granzyme B-dependent apoptosis, using human muscle biopsy specimens of polymyositis patients and models of polymyositis in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of necroptosis suppresses not only CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes-induced cell death of myotubes but also the release of inflammatory molecules including HMGB1. Treatment with a necroptosis inhibitor or anti-HMGB1 antibodies ameliorates myositis-induced muscle weakness as well as muscle cell death and inflammation in the muscles. Thus, targeting necroptosis in muscle cells is a promising strategy for treating polymyositis providing an alternative to current therapies directed at leukocytes.","output":"Targeting necroptosis in muscle fibers ameliorates inflammatory myopathies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Parental knowledge, belief, and attitude about oral health affect childrens dental cleaning behavior.

We employed a multi-stage process to develop PACER including a scoping review, question refinement, content validity, and cognitive interviews. Content validity and cognitive interviews were assessed within the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (NNIP) and for residents of different tenure in both gentrifying and non-gentrifying neighborhoods to ensure PACER considers the complex nature of neighborhood change for different people within different urban contexts. We piloted the instrument to a sample from the resident panel BeHeardPhilly to assess acceptability and data quality.

The HDAg open reading frame was also inserted into an expression vector containing a simian virus 40 T-antigen promoter and expressed into COS 7 cells. In both systems, a protein species of 26 kilodaltons was synthesized from this open reading frame and could be specifically immunoprecipitated with antisera obtained from patients with delta hepatitis.

Study SelectionSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies with []1000 participants aged []70 years that presented seroprevalence in elderly people; aimed to generate samples reflecting the general population; and whose location had available data on cumulative COVID-19 deaths in elderly (primary cutoff []70 years; []65 or []60 also eligible). Data ExtractionWe extracted the most fully adjusted (if unavailable, unadjusted) seroprevalence estimates and sampling procedure details. We also extracted age- and residence-stratified cumulative COVID-19 deaths (until 1 week after the seroprevalence sampling midpoint) from official reports, and population statistics, to calculate IFRs corrected for unmeasured antibody types. Sample size-weighted IFRs were estimated for countries with multiple estimates. Secondary analyses examined data on younger age strata from the same studies. Data SynthesisTwenty-three seroprevalence surveys representing 14 countries were included. Across all countries, the median IFR in community-dwelling elderly and elderly overall was 2.4% (range 0.3%-7.2%) and 5.5% (range 0.3%-12.1%). IFR was higher with larger proportions of people >85 years.

Metallic suture anchors had higher failure strength when compared to bioabsorbable ones. Often either in metallic or in bioabsorbable anchors, the eyelet fails first. The failure sequence in ovine tissues is found to be in the following order: simple and mattress suturing techniques, nonabsorbable sutures, massive cuff tear and modified Mason-Allen suturing techniques, bioabsorbable anchors, and metallic anchors.

METHODS: A total of 40 children with mechanical ventilation following congenital cardiac surgery, who required volume expansion (VE) were included in this study. Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), SV, and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored before and after PLR and VE. Besides, we assessed changes in SV and CO by bedside ultrasound. Patients showing > 10 % increase in SV in response to VE were considered to be responders (26 patients), while the rest (14 patients) were defined as non-responders. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that SV-PLR and CO- PLR were positively correlated with SV-VE (r = 0.683, p < 0.001 and r = 0.374, p = 0.017, respectively), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of SV-PLR was 0.879 (95 % CI [0.745 1.000], p < 0.001).

We found that a 3D-printed flexible frame (i.e., brace) increased the inward protection efficiency of a cotton-based cloth mask by 13-43% for particles ranging in size from 0.5-2 mu m relative to the efficiency obtained in the absence of the frame. For example, the use of a flexible form-fitting frame increased the inward protection efficiency for 0.5 and 1 mu m particles by 31 and 40%, respectively. Rapid prototyping of the mask frame geometry and material properties was also highlighted for optimization of the facial contact area and mechanical matching.

HRCT findings of the lungs for all patients were retrospectively reviewed by two independent radiologists. RESULTS: In the metapneumovirus group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (100%), consolidation (100%), parenchymal band (100%), bronchiectasis (75%). Crazy paving pattern was absent. They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location and bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of patients. In the SARS group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (86.8%), crazy paving pattern (73.7%) and consolidation (68%). Bronchiectasis was not seen. Majority of patient demonstrated segmental or lobar in distribution and bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were of consistent rare features in both groups. CONCLUSION: Ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening and consolidations were consistent HRCT manifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS.

We aim to provide an accessible research platform to determine demographic, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors for infection, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, to measure the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilisation and long-term health, and to enable the evaluation of natural experiments of policy interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Two privacy-protecting population-level cohorts have been created and derived from multisourced demographic and healthcare data. The C20 cohort consists of 3.2 million people in Wales on the 1 January 2020 with follow-up until 31 May 2020. The complete cohort dataset will be updated monthly with some individual datasets available daily. The C16 cohort consists of 3 million people in Wales on the 1 January 2016 with follow-up to 31 December 2019. C16 is designed as a counterfactual cohort to provide contextual comparative population data on disease, health service utilisation and mortality. Study outcomes will: (a) characterise the epidemiology of COVID-19, (b) assess socioeconomic and demographic influences on infection and outcomes, (c) measure the impact of COVID-19 on short -term and longer-term population outcomes and (d) undertake studies on the transmission and spatial spread of infection.

Using neuroimaging tools, we found that while the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) subserved generosity in the gain frame, the insular cortex was selectively recruited during generous choices in the loss frame. We provide support for a network-model according to which TPJ and insula differentially promote generosity by modulating value signals in the VMPFC in a frame-dependent fashion.

Clinical evidence regarding the use of tigecycline in the treatment of S. maltophilia infections is scarce. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of tigecycline treating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to S. maltophilia in comparison with fluoroquinolones. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between January 2017 and December 2020 with the diagnosis of VAP caused by S. maltophilia receiving either tigecycline or fluoroquinolones as the definitive therapy  48 h. Clinical outcomes including 28-day mortality, clinical cure and microbiological cure were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with S. maltophilia VAP included, 46 received tigecycline, and 36 received fluoroquinolones; 70.7% of patients had polymicrobial pneumonia, and the appropriate empiric therapy was applied to only 14.6% of patients. The overall 28-day mortality was 39%. Compared with patients receiving fluoroquinolones, tigecycline therapy resulted in worse clinical cure (32.6% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.009) and microbiological cure (28.6% vs. 59.1%, p = 0.045), while there was no statistical difference between 28-day mortality (47.8% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.105) in the two groups. Similar results were also shown in the inverse probability of treatment weighted univariable regression model and multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The standard dose of tigecycline therapy was associated with a lower clinical and microbiological cure rate but not associated with an increased 28-day mortality in patients with S. maltophilia VAP compared with fluoroquinolones. Considering the unfavorable clinical outcomes, we therefore recommend against using the standard dose of tigecycline in treating S. maltophilia VAP unless new clinical evidence emerges.

We devised a network-based integration of multi-omic data to prioritize the most important genes related to COVID-19 and subsequently re-rank the identified candidate drugs. Our approach resulted in a highly informed integrated drug shortlist by combining structural diversity filtering along with experts' curation and drug-target mapping on the depicted molecular pathways. In addition to the recently proposed drugs that are already generating promising results such as dexamethasone and remdesivir, our list includes inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase (bosutinib, dasatinib, cytarabine and saracatinib), which appear to be involved in multiple COVID-19 pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, we highlight specific immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs like dactolisib and methotrexate and inhibitors of histone deacetylase like hydroquinone and vorinostat with potential beneficial effects in their mechanisms of action.

METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, adjusted observational cohort study in consecutive COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) receiving respiratory support with HFNO from 12 March to 9 June 2020. Patients were classified as HFNO with or without awake-PP. Logistic models were fitted to predict treatment at baseline using the following variables: age, sex, obesity, non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, APACHE-II, C-reactive protein, days from symptoms onset to HFNO initiation, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation. We compared data on demographics, vital signs, laboratory markers, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, days to intubation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality between HFNO patients with and without awake-PP. RESULTS: A total of 1076 patients with COVID-19 ARF were admitted, of which 199 patients received HFNO and were analyzed. Fifty-five (27.6%) were pronated during HFNO; 60 (41%) and 22 (40%) patients from the HFNO and HFNO + awake-PP groups were intubated. The use of awake-PP as an adjunctive therapy to HFNO did not reduce the risk of intubation [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.53-1.43), p = 0.60].

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with its emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) and reducing high-risk contacts, was the catalyst needed to bring telemedicine into mainstream consciousness and acceptance. OBJECTIVES: We first review some of the key factors that precipitated this abrupt alteration of the perception of telemedicine. We then detail the creation of a department-wide telemedicine network using off-the-shelf consumer products. Our goal was to very rapidly install a system that was familiar to end-users for the purpose of reducing high-risk contacts and conserving PPE. Sourcing from the consumer realm proved to be advantageous over enterprise-level equipment when these goals were desired. DISCUSSION: After a rollout of 1.5 weeks from zero to fully operational, we showed an immediate decrease in high-risk contacts and PPE use. All 80 rooms plus all triage areas in our department were outfitted with Apple iPads running Zoom. User adoption was high and telemedicine use increased from a??17 to a??90 instances a day, a 429% increase. We saw a decrease in high-risk contacts of about 75%, with a concomitant cost savings in PPE.

Numerous investigations have been carried out to discover a compound that can inhibit the biological activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, which is an enzyme related to the viral replication. Among these, PF-07321332 (Nirmatrelvir) is currently under clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy. Therefore, in this work, atomistic and electronic simulations were performed to unravel the binding and covalent inhibition mechanism of the compound to Mpro. Initially, 5 s of steered-molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to evaluate the ligand-binding process to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The successfully generated bound state between the two molecules showed the important role of the PF-07321332 pyrrolidinyl group and the residues Glu166 and Gln189 in the ligand-binding process. Moreover, from the MD-refined structure, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were carried out to unravel the reaction mechanism for the formation of the thioimidate product from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the PF-07321332 inhibitor. We found that the catalytic triad Cys145CHis41CAsp187 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro plays an important role in the activation of the PF-07321332 covalent inhibitor, which renders the deprotonation of Cys145 and, thus, facilitates further reaction. Our results are definitely beneficial for a better understanding of the inhibition mechanism and designing new effective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Measures such as strategic natural ventilation and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration remain poorly implemented and mask mandates are often progressively lifted as vaccination rollout is enhanced. MethodsWe adapted a previously developed aerosol transmission model to study the effect of interventions (natural ventilation, face masks, HEPA filtration, and their combinations) on the concentration of virus particles in a classroom of 160 m3 containing one infectious individual. The cumulative dose of viruses absorbed by exposed occupants was calculated. ResultsThe most effective single intervention was natural ventilation through the full opening of six windows all day during the winter (14-fold decrease in cumulative dose), followed by the universal use of surgical face masks (8-fold decrease). In the spring/summer, natural ventilation was only effective ([] 2-fold decrease) when windows were fully open all day. In the winter, partly opening two windows all day or fully opening six windows at the end of each class was effective as well ([] 2-fold decrease). Opening windows during yard and lunch breaks only had minimal effect ([] 1.2-fold decrease). One HEPA filter was as effective as two windows partly open all day during the winter (2.5-fold decrease) while two filters were more effective (4-fold decrease). Combined interventions (i.e., natural ventilation, masks, and HEPA filtration) were the most effective ([] 30-fold decrease). Combined interventions remained highly effective in the presence of a super-spreader.

However, resilience argument state that if people get more time with families and loved ones, their resilience level will improve and as a result mental wellbeing improves as well. As lockdown brings the opportunity to spend more time with families, this study hypothesise that mental health gets affected at the early days of lockdown but starts to improve at a later stage. Using data from UK household longitudinal data and adopting appropriate statistical tests, this study finds that the relationship between lockdown days and mental health is U-shaped, meaning that mental health becomes worse in the early days of lockdown but improves at a later stage.

Two thirds of our respondents reported that their incomes had fallen after the pandemic began and almost half reported that their ability to satisfy their food needs had worsened.

However, very few studies have been conducted to reveal the mechanism behind the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on tumors. Methods: Demographic data extracted from 33 cancer types and over 10,000 samples were employed to determine the comprehensive landscape of the RAS. Expression distribution, pretranscriptional and posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) as well as genomic alterations, DNA methylation and m6A modification were analyzed in both tissue and cell lines. The clinical phenotype, prognostic value and significance of the RAS during immune infiltration were identified. Results: Low expression of AGTR1 was common in tumors compared to normal tissues, while very low expression of AGTR2 and MAS1 was detected in both tissues and cell lines. Differential expression patterns of ACE in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) were correlated with ubiquitin modification involving E3 ligases. Genomic alterations of the RAS family were infrequent across TCGA pan-cancer program, and ACE had the highest alteration frequency compared with other members. Low expression of AGTR1 may result from hypermethylation in the promoter. Downregulation of RAS family was linked to higher clinical stage and worse survival (as measured by disease-specific survival [DSS], overall survival [OS] or progression-free interval [PFI]), especially for ACE2 and AGTR1 in KIRC. ACE-AGTR1, a classical axis of the RAS family related to immune infiltration, was positively correlated with M2-type macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune checkpoint genes in most cancers. Conclusion: ACE, ACE2, AGT and AGTR1 were differentially expressed in 33 types of cancers. PTM of RAS family was found to rely on ubiquitination. ACE2 and AGTR1 might serve as independent prognostic factors for LGG and KIRC. SARS-CoV-2 might modify the tumor microenvironment by regulating the RAS family, thus affecting the biological processes of cancer.","output":"Comprehensive landscape of the renin-angiotensin system in Pan-cancer: a potential downstream mediated mechanism of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives: to analyze the lethality and clinical characteristics in Pernambuco women with neoplasia that were infected by SARS-CoV-2.

In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The in vitro data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 3-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 3-end of the TBSV (?)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (?)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an in vitro assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.","output":"A Co-Opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase Enhances Tombusvirus Plus-Strand Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obstetric anaesthesia is emerging as one of the most demanding subspecialities of anaesthesia.

The primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and seven-day intensive-care unit (ICU) admission respectively. We compared their predictive performance using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 1363 patients, the mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 24.6% (228/925) in Sao Paulo and 21.0% (92/438) in Barcelona. For in-hospital mortality, we found higher AUROCs for PSI (0.79, 95%CI 0.77-0.82), 4C (0.78, 95%CI 0.75-0.81), COVID GRAM (0.77, 95%CI 0.75-0.80), and CURB-65 (0.74 95%CI 0.72-0.77).

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from 3 April 2020 to 13 September 2020. Dyspnoea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/-LR) for detecting hypoxaemia. In the primary analysis, hypoxaemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%; the diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea was also assessed across a range of oxygen saturation cutoffs from 92% to 97%. RESULTS: During the study period, 89/501 (17.8%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 17/89 (19.1%) were diagnosed with hypoxaemia. The presence/absence of dyspnoea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxaemia, with SN 47% (95% CI 24% to 72%), SP 80% (95% CI 68% to 88%), NPV 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%), PPV 36% (95% CI 18% to 59%), +LR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7) and -LR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). The SN of dyspnoea was 50% (95% CI 19% to 81%) when a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxaemia. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score >1 (SP 98%, 95% CI 88% to 100%), Roth maximal count <12 (SP 100%, 95% CI 75% to 100%) and Roth counting time <8 s (SP 93%, 95% CI 66% to 100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxaemia, but displayed low SN (&#8804;50%). CONCLUSIONS: Subjective dyspnoea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxaemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19. Safe home management of patients with COVID-19 should incorporate home oxygenation saturation monitoring.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in detecting hypoxaemia among outpatients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease.

The autopsies were performed within the early postmortem interval (between 1.5 and 15 hr, mean: 5.6 hr) to minimize the bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Very high viral loads (>10(4)copies/ml) were detected in most patients' lungs, and the presence of intact viral particles in the lung tissue could be verified by transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, viral RNA was detected throughout various extrapulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage.

METHODS One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer between April 2010 and December 2010 were classified into one of the two groups according to the site of the minilaparotomy: a transumbilical incision group (n = 92) and a left lower transverse incision group (n = 55). RESULTS Demographic data, operation time, estimated blood loss, frequency of transfusion, size of the tumor, number of harvested lymph nodes, distal resection margins, time to first flatus, and length of hospital stay were similar between the two groups. Postoperative pain scores were also similar between the two groups. The length of the minilaparotomy incision was shorter in the transumbilical group than the left lower transverse group at operation (mean, 4.6 vs. 6.2 cm, p = 0.000). The postoperative mean satisfaction score was higher in the transumbilical group, but this was not statistically significant (7.6 vs. 7.1, p = 0.224). Fourteen patients in the transumbilical group and 7 patients in the left lower transverse group developed wound-related complications (p = 0.810), including two cases of incisional hernia, both in the transumbilical group.

The impact of hospitalization during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on psychological well-being and health-related quality of life is expected to be higher due to the exceptional circumstances within and outside the hospital during the pandemic surge. The objective of this study was to quantify psychological distress up to three months after discharge in patients hospitalized during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave. We also aimed to determine HRQoL, to explore predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL, and to examine whether psychological distress was higher in COVID-19 confirmed patients, and in those treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Methods: In this single-center, observational cohort study, adult patients hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 between March 16 and April 28, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were stratified in analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR results and the necessity for ICU treatment. The primary outcome was psychological distress, expressed as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, up to three months post-discharge. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was the secondary outcome. Exploratory outcomes comprised predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL. Results: 294 of 622 eligible patients participated in this study (median age 64 years, 36% female). 16% and 13% of these patients reported probable PTSD, 29% and 20% probable anxiety, and 32% and 24% probabledepression at one and three months after hospital discharge, respectively. ICU patients reported less frequently probable depression, but no differences were found in PTSD, anxiety, or overall HRQoL. COVID-19 patients had a worse physical quality of life one month after discharge, and ICU patients reported a better mental quality of life three months after discharge. PTSD severity was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Severity of anxiety was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Depression severity was predicted by time after discharge and educational level. Conclusion: COVID-19 suspected patients hospitalized during the pandemic frequently suffer from psychological distress and poor health-related quality of life after hospital discharge. Non-COVID-19 and non-ICU patients appear to be at least as affected as COVID-19 and ICU patients, underscoring that (post-)hospital pandemic care should not predominantly focus on COVID-19 infected patients.

To achieve the objective, a four-stage primary study of households in Poland was designed and conducted. Subjective assessments of households perceptions about social security are presented. The possibility of loss of financial stability, job loss and deterioration of the household situation was assessed. The respondents also assessed the possibility of a worsening of the situation in the country, an increase in family poverty and an increase in unemployment in Poland. One of the most important findings is the dichotomy of the perceptions of the respondents, who assess the situation of their household better than that of the country. A different perspective on security is also provided by the rural optimism index, which can also be seen as a measure of vulnerability to social security. The considerations and analyses presented can be useful for both theoretical and practical purposes. The study improves knowledge on how households function under conditions of vulnerability.

Despite implementing one of the strictest control measures-including a three-week complete lockdown, there was no sign of a declining epidemic curve. The objective of the current analyses is to determine, hypothetically, the optimal timing and duration of a full lockdown in Kuwait that would result in controlling new infections and lead to a substantial reduction in case hospitalizations. METHODS: The analysis was conducted using a stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC), eight state model that depicts the disease transmission and spread of SARS-CoV 2. Transmission of infection occurs between individuals through social contacts at home, in schools, at work, and during other communal activities. RESULTS: The model shows that a lockdown 10 days before the epidemic peak for 90 days is optimal but a more realistic duration of 45 days can achieve about a 45% reduction in both new infections and case hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: In the view of the forthcoming waves of the COVID19 pandemic anticipated in Kuwait using a correctly-timed and sufficiently long lockdown represents a workable management strategy that encompasses the most stringent form of social distancing with the ability to significantly reduce transmissions and hospitalizations.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of depression, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal risk or ideation in patients with RA associated with vitamin D serum levels. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited RA patients older than 18 years, classified into 3 groups according to serum vitamin D levels: sufficient, 30 ng/mL; insufficient, 20C29 ng/mL; and deficient, <20 ng/mL. Based on the self-reported Plutchik and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, we evaluated the association of suicidal risk, depression, and anxiety with the vitamin D levels in RA and the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: We studied 72 patients with RA between January and October 2019. We found an inverse correlation between Plutchik score and suicidal risk with inadequate vitamin D levels, but not with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Suicidal ideation was associated with a higher score on the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in RA patients, a Plutchik low correlation coefficient with inadequate serum levels of vitamin D was found.

Two key goals have guided the re-organisation, the need to maintain social distancing and reduce risk to people using the services and the need to prepare for an influx of people with COVID-19. Facilities were re-organised to have screening and streaming at the entrance and patients were separated into hot and cold streams. Both streams had see and treat stations for the rapid treatment of minor ailments. Patients in separate streams were then managed further. If patients with chronic conditions were stable, they were provided with home delivery of medication by community health workers. Community health workers also engaged in community-based screening and testing. Initial evaluation of PHC preparedness was generally good. However, a number of key issues were identified. Additional infrastructure was required in some facilities to keep the streams separate with the onset of winter. Managers had to actively address the anxiety and fears of the primary care workforce. Attention also needed to be given to the prevention and treatment of non-COVID conditions as utilisation of these services decreased. The epidemic exposed intersectoral and intrasectoral fault lines, particularly access to social services at a time when they were most needed.

OBJECTIVE: A mandatory staffing ratio is often mentioned to counteract the downsizing in German clinics. The role of the lower staffing limit is explained in the following article. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed the current draft laws of the federal government, as well as position papers and statements from federal political representatives such as the Marburger Bund, Bundesverband Deutscher Urologen and the German Medical Association (Bundes?rztekammer) since 2018. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analysis of current developments in nursing policy shows that the first step is a needs-based assessment of personnel and subsequent financing in the clinic setting. With adequate staffing, as in the traffic light scheme of the German Medical Association, not only would clinics position themselves as attractive employers and training centers for large parts of the urological medical profession, but would also significantly improve working conditions, patient care and patient safety.

In macaques, spermatogenesis could be regenerated by intratesticular transplantation of SSCs, but no studies have involved cytotoxic treatment before puberty and transplantation after puberty, which would be the most likely clinical scenario. OBJECTIVES To evaluate donor-derived functional sperm production after SSC transplantation to adult monkeys that had received testicular irradiation during the prepubertal period. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained prepubertal testis tissue by unilaterally castrating 6 prepubertal monkeys and 2 weeks later irradiated the remaining testes with 6.9 Gy. However, because spermatogenic recovery was observed, we irradiated them again 14 months later with 7 Gy. Three of the monkeys were treated with GnRH-antagonist (GnRH-ant) for 8 weeks. The cryopreserved testis cells from the castrated testes were then allogeneically transplanted into the intact testes of all monkeys. Tissues were harvested 10 months later for analyses. RESULTS In three of the six monkeys, 61%, 38% and 11% of the epididymal sperm DNA were of the donor genotype. The ability to recover donor-derived sperm production was not enhanced by the GnRH-ant pretreatment. However, the extent of filling seminiferous tubules during the transplantation procedure was correlated with the eventual production of donor sperm. The donor epididymal sperm from the recipient with 61% donor contribution were capable of fertilizing rhesus eggs and forming embryos. Although the transplantation was done into the rete testis, two GnRH-ant treated monkeys, which did not produce donor-derived epididymal sperm, displayed irregular tubular cords in the interstitium containing testicular sperm derived from the transplanted donor cells.

It aims to illustrate the technological solutions that WHO, in collaboration with the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), OpenWHO's platform provider, employed in response to the unique challenges this surge in demand for learning engendered. Data on OpenWHO use, including geographic patterns and certificate attainment, were extracted from OpenWHO's internal and external reporting systems. Descriptive analysis was employed to identify trends and compare OpenWHO use with COVID-19 caseload in each WHO region. Data on the OpenWHO system load were obtained from the OpenWHO load balancer (HAProxy). The OpenWHO team responded to the need for trustworthy, evidence-based knowledge on COVID-19 via three main avenues: increased scale, targeting the needs of affected and underserved communities, and prioritising multilingualism. Each approach brought novel problems, which WHO and HPI leveraged their collaboration to meet by employing technology.

The aim of this study is to investigate the construct in a University and in an hospital in northern Italy and evaluate the levels of nomophobia between nurses and students. METHODS: It has been conducted an observational study with a questionnaire with a sample of nursing students and nurses. Both the two studies had the common goal to investigate the levels of nomophobia and evaluate the comparison between the two groups. RESULTS: In general, both nurses and students they dont seem to demonstrate nomophobias critical levels.

Both nurses and students affirm to use, with a certain frequency their smartphone at work although, above all the students, usually for appropriate and justified reasons. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to consider the development of an educational project that regularizes the use of smartphones, explaining the meaning of nomophobia, right from the beginning of the University career so to correctly address the students (and future professionals) behaviours to make them aware of mobile phones misuse, especially in the clinical setting that can easily cause distractions and consequently irreversible errors.

The emerging viewpoint of MUSes as the root causes of unsatisfiability has led MUSes to find applications in a wide variety of diagnostic approaches. Recent advances in identification and enumeration of MUSes have motivated researchers to discover applications that can benefit from rich information about the set of MUSes. One such extension is that of counting the number of MUSes. The current best approach for MUS counting is to employ a MUS enumeration algorithm, which often does not scale for the cases with a reasonably large number of MUSes. Motivated by the success of hashing-based techniques in the context of model counting, we design the first approximate MUS counting procedure with [Formula: see text] guarantees, called [Formula: see text]. Our approach avoids exhaustive MUS enumeration by combining the classical technique of universal hashing with advances in QBF solvers along with a novel usage of union and intersection of MUSes to achieve runtime efficiency.

EU energy policy has provided a wide range of measures to achieve an integrated energy market and sustainability of the building sector. Various incentives and financial instruments have been promoted and financed by governments to help consumers in energy retrofit processes. These include direct investments and fiscal, financial, and market instruments. Public measures have been widely studied but private initiatives have not. In this study, the energy-efficiency mortgage (EEM) is investigated as a credit scheme to attract young people to a real estate market for sustainable buildings, characterized by high sale prices. A choice experiment (CE) was modelled to investigate the preferences of potential young buyers of a new home. The results of this exploratory survey showed an appreciation of the purchase of new A-rated properties according to the Energy Performance Certificate, compared to those that need to be retrofitted or not retrofitted. Consumers like the option of a home energy efficiency renovation being fully managed by a third party (i.e., following the one-stop shop model). The key appeal of energy efficiency for consumers ranges from its ability to support better energy management, to better property value management. The EEM seems to be a promising tool to stimulate investments in energy efficiency and to promote the accessibility and affordability of housing in the sustainable housing market. The results of this study can help private financial institutions to propose appropriate credit plans, which limit the risk of default by the borrower.

In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (968%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 59% (95% CI 49-71) for 1779 household contacts, 13% (09-19) for 2231 work contacts, and 13% (10-17) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 538 [95% CI 182-1584]; p=00023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (786 [386-1602]; p<00001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 392 [95% CI 207-740], p<00001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (267 [121-588]; p=0015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (307 [155-608]; p=00013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS: Data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID\\\\19 for 2,814 US counties were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the spatial aspects of this pandemic and investigate the disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities. Multiple regression models were used to explore the contextual risk factors of infections and death across US counties. We included population density, percent of population aged 65+, percent population in poverty, percent minority population, and percent of the uninsured as independent variables. A state\\\\level measure of the percent of the population that has been tested for COVID\\\\19 was used to control for the impact of testing. FINDINGS: The impact of COVID\\\\19 in the United States has been extremely uneven. Although densely populated large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are hotspots of the pandemic, it is counterintuitive that incidence and mortality rates in some small cities and nonmetropolitan counties approximate those in epicenters such as New York City.

Therefore, modeling these time series by conventional methods can produce an arbitrary mistake. To overcome the accuracy problem associated with conventional approaches, this investigation assumes intelligent-based prediction approaches to deal with the unemployment data and to predict the unemployment rate for the upcoming years more precisely. These intelligent-based unemployment rate strategies will force their implications by repeating diversity in the unemployment rate. For illustration purposes, unemployment data sets of five advanced and five developing countries of Asia, essentially Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and five agricultural countries (i.e., Pakistan, China, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia) are selected. The hybrid ARIMA-ARNN model performed well among all hybrid models for advanced countries of Asia, while the hybrid ARIMA-ANN outperformed for developing countries aside from China, and hybrid ARIMA-SVM performed well for China. Furthermore, for future unemployment rate prediction, these selected models are utilized. The result displays that in developing countries of Asia, the unemployment rate will be three times higher as compared to advanced countries in the coming years, and it will take double the time to address the impacts of Coronavirus in developing countries than in developed countries of Asia.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and unemployment rate: A hybrid unemployment rate prediction approach for developed and developing countries of Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the prime global health concern of the year 2020.

Our aim of this article is to review the current role of the ablative therapy in the management of CRLM patients. Main indications for thermal ablation include (I) unresectable liver lesions; (II) in combination with hepatectomy; (III) in patients with significant medical comorbidities or poor performance status (PS); (IV) a small (<3 cm) solitary lesion, which would otherwise necessitate a major liver resection; and (V) patient preference. There are several approaches and modalities for ablative therapy, including open, percutaneous, and laparoscopic approaches, as well as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Each approach and ablation modality have its own pros and cons. Percutaneous and laparoscopic approaches are preferred due to minimally invasive nature, yet laparoscopic approach has more benefits from thorough intraoperative ultrasound (US) exam as well as complete peritoneal staging with laparoscopy. Similarly, whereas high local tumor failure rate has been a major concern with RFA, MWA or microwave thermosphere ablation (MTA) have demonstrated significantly improved local tumor control due to homogenous tissue heating, ability to reach higher tissue temperatures, and less susceptible to the \\"heat-sink\\" effect. Although liver resection is the standard of care for CRLM, there have been some retrospective studies demonstrating similar oncological outcome between ablative therapy and surgical resection in very selected populations with small (<3 cm) solitary CRLM. Lastly, ablative therapy and liver resection should not be mutually exclusive, especially in the management of bilobar liver metastases. Concomitant ablative therapy with hepatectomy may spare the patients from having two-stage hepatectomy with less morbidity. The role of the thermal ablation will continue to evolve in patients with resectable and ablatable lesions owing to newly emerging technology, in addition to new systemic treatment options, including immunotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).","output":"Role of thermal ablation in the management of colorectal liver metastasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The histological evaluation of the renal parenchyma is often essential in cases of several renal diseases and provides useful information in determining the prognosis and guiding treatment.

Current standardised screening questionnaires can be arduous or confronting and are ill-validated for online use, despite a universal shift to digital healthcare. The present study describes the development and pilot validation of a novel digital screening tool (the InsideOut Institute-Screener) for high risk and early stage eating disorders to drive early intervention and reduced morbidity. METHODS: We utilised a mixed cross-sectional and repeated measures longitudinal survey research design to assess symptom severity and recognised parameters of statistical validity. Participants were recruited through social media and traditional advertising, and through MTurk. An Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) global score of 2.3 and assessment of eating disorder behaviours was used to determine probable ED. 1346 participants aged 14C74 (mean [SE] age 26.60 [11.14] years; 73.8% female, 22.6% male) completed the survey battery. 19% were randomised to two-week follow-up for reliability analysis. RESULTS: Strong positive correlations between the IOI-S and both the EDE-Q global (r(s) = .88) and SCOFF (r(s) = .75) total score were found, providing support for the concurrent validity of the scale. Inter-item correlations were moderate to strong (r(s) = .46C.73). Correlations between the IOI-S and two measures of social desirability diverged, providing support for the discriminant validity of the scale. The IOI-S demonstrated high internal consistency ( = .908,  = .910) and excellent two-week testCretest reliability (.968, 95% CI 0.959C0.975; p  0.1).

Seipin, a protein essential for normal cytoplasmic LD formation in the ER, is absent in the INM. Knockdown of seipin increases nuclear LDs and PA in the nucleus, whereas seipin overexpression decreases these. Seipin knockdown also up-regulates lipin-1 expression, and lipin-1 knockdown decreases the effect of seipin knockdown on nuclear LDs without affecting PA redistribution. These results indicate that seipin is not directly involved in nuclear LD formation but instead restrains it by affecting lipin-1 expression and intracellular PA distribution.","output":"Nuclear lipid droplets form in the inner nuclear membrane in a seipin-independent manner."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has been largely controlled in China, to the point where case fatality rate (CFR) data can be comprehensively evaluated. METHODS: Data on confirmed patients, with a final outcome reported as of 29 March 2020, were obtained from official websites and other internet sources. The hospitalized CFR (HCFR) was estimated, epidemiological features described, and risk factors for a fatal outcome identified. RESULTS: The overall HCFR in China was estimated to be 4.6% (95% CI 4.5-4.8%, P < 0.001). It increased with age and was higher in males than females. Although the highest HCFR observed was in male patients &#8805;70 years old, the relative risks for death outcome by sex varied across age groups, and the greatest HCFR risk ratio for males vs. females was shown in the age group of 50-60 years, higher than age groups of 60-70 and &#8805; 70 years. Differential age/sex HCFR patterns across geographical regions were found: the age effect on HCFR was greater in other provinces outside Hubei than in Wuhan. An effect of longer interval from symptom onset to admission was only observed outside Hubei, not in Wuhan. By performing multivariate analysis and survival analysis, the higher HCFR was associated with older age (both P < 0.001), and male sex (both P < 0.001). Only in regions outside Hubei, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, were associated with higher HCFR.

Unfortunately, a large cohort of patients do not achieve functional independence with treatment, even though the results are more robust than with medical management. The hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) on MRI is an indication of the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that the presence of HARM on MRI correlates with worse neurological recovery after reperfusion therapy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 35 consecutive patients who between February 24, 2016 and April 23, 2016 underwent MRI to determine the presence of HARM after thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Demographic, radiographic imaging, and outcome data were collected. Univariate and binary logistic regression models were performed to assess predictors for improvement of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by 8 points at 24 hours. RESULTS The 35 patients studied had an average age of 6414 years of age with a median NIHSS score of 15 (IQR 9-20). Eighteen patients (51%) were found to have a HARM-positive MRI. In univariate analysis, patients with HARM were older, had lower reperfusion rates and more postprocedural hemorrhages. In binary logistic regression modeling, the absence of HARM was independently associated with a 8-point NIHSS score improvement at 24 hours (OR=7.14, 95% CI 1.22 to 41.67). CONCLUSIONS This preliminary analysis shows that the presence of HARM may be linked to worse neurological recovery 24 hours after thrombectomy.

However, responses to the pandemic have also seen attempts to avoid negative health consequences with improved access. Appropriate and well-understood access is a threshold condition for timely diagnosis and adherence but must be supported by both regulatory and reimbursement decisions. Americans often delay medical care due to inconvenience and out-of-pocket expense, particularly as many are responsible for growing out-of-pocket medical expenses under high-deductible employer plans. Non-adherence has been estimated to cost billions annually in the US alone. Patients who received health literacy interventions have shown a higher rate of treatment adherence than did those who did not, suggesting that millions of US adults with low health literacy could be assisted to better adherence with improved health literacy. Objective: We review the trends in access related to COVID-19 and contextualize, provisionally, how these changes may continue to improve access after the pandemic. Developments: Government and private insurers responded by expanding access with lower out-of-pocket costs and greater leveraging of technologies for more convenient care. These technologies, like telemedicine and remote monitoring in trials, can enhance the evidence available for regulatory and reimbursement policy decisions, including data on relevant subpopulations. Access to COVID-19 related care was enhanced with lower OOPs, and chronic conditions advantageously reclassified as preventative medicine.

We therefore hypothesize that T-cell content in intracranial thrombi may also be a biomarker of atherothrombotic origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS We histopathologically investigated 54 consecutive thrombi retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke patients.

We adapted two mathematical models, one with [Formula: see text]-cells and the other with no [Formula: see text]-cell component to determine their capability in predicting glucose concentration and determine type 1 diabetes pathways using published glucose concentration data for four groups of experimental mice. The groups of mice were numbered Mice Group 1C4, depending on the diabetes severity of each group, with severity increasing from group 1C4. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on a Bayesian framework was used to fit the model to determine the best model structure. Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) approaches were used to assess the best model structure for type 1 diabetes. In fitting the model with no [Formula: see text]-cells to glucose level data, we varied insulin absorption rate and insulin clearance rate. However, the model with [Formula: see text]-cells required more parameters to match the data and we fitted the [Formula: see text]-cell glucose tolerance factor, whole body insulin clearance rate, glucose production rate, and glucose clearance rate. Fitting the models to the blood glucose concentration level gave the least difference in AIC of [Formula: see text] , and a difference in BIC of [Formula: see text] for Mice Group 4. The estimated AIC and BIC values were highest for Mice Group 1 than all other mice groups. The models gave substantial differences in AIC and BIC values for Mice Groups 1C3 ranging from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text].

It has been associated with increased risks of hypokalaemia and cardiac disorders. We report a case of torsades de pointes (TdP) associated with abiraterone use and refractory hypokalaemia in a man with mCRPC. CASE SUMMARY: A 78-year-old man with mCRPC presented to the emergency room for generalized weakness. Laboratory results revealed a potassium level of 2.2 mmol/L (3.5C5.0), magnesium level of 2.4 mg/dL (1.6C2.5), and normal kidney and hepatic functions. Initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate of 106 b.p.m., frequent premature ventricular contractions, and a QTc of 634 ms. The patient had multiple episodes of TdP, became pulseless and underwent advanced cardiac life support, including defibrillation. Despite a total of 220 mEq of intravenous potassium chloride, his potassium level only improved to 2.8 mmol/L. He received spironolactone and amiloride to promote urinary potassium reabsorption in addition to hydrocortisone, in an effort to reduce abiraterones effect on increasing mineralocorticoid synthesis. DISCUSSION: Abiraterone has been widely used in mCRPC since its approval by the Food and Drug Adminstration in 2011.

The viral 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTR) have been involved in the regulation of several molecular mechanisms. However, in astrovirues have been less characterized. Here, we analyzed the secondary structures of the 5 and 3 UTR of HAstV, as well as their putative target sites that might be recognized by cellular factors. To our knowledge, this is the first bioinformatic analysis that predicts the HAstV 5 UTR secondary structure. The analysis showed that both the UTR sequence and secondary structure are highly conserved in all HAstVs analyzed, suggesting their regulatory role of viral activities. Notably, the UTRs of HAstVs contain putative binding sites for the serine/arginine-rich factors SRSF2, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF3, and the multifunctional hnRNPE2 protein. More importantly, putative binding sites for PTB were localized in single-stranded RNA sequences, while hnRNPE2 sites were localized in double-stranded sequence of the HAstV 5 and 3 UTR structures. These analyses suggest that the combination of SRSF proteins, hnRNPE2 and PTB described here could be involved in the maintenance of the secondary structure of the HAstVs, possibly allowing the recruitment of the replication complex that selects and recruits viral RNA replication templates.

ASF is generally known as a contagious and lethal disease, but if chronic infection spreads, then disease control would be more difficult. In the current study, we highlighted the possibility of lower virulent virus distribution throughout China and the subsequent general risk of the virus being released from the country. The kernel density estimation showed that the two highest kernel density areas of ASF notification were located in Northeast and Midwest China. Four of the five provinces where lower virulent ASFV was isolated overlapped with areas of relatively high ASF notification density. In terms of the risk of ASFV spreading from China, eight of the 10 largest airports and three of the 10 largest seaports are located in areas of relatively high ASF notification density.

As-synthesized mesoporous silica nanorod (MSNR) was modified with zwitterions to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of protein and to improve the dispersity. HSA was fixed onto MSNR through drug-protein interactions and covalent bonds, respectively. Benzoic-imine bonds were introduced into the designs to realize pH responsiveness. The fluorescence quenching effect of drugs on HSA was used to monitor the drug release in simulated body fluids containing proteins. The results indicated that protein gating could effectively reduce premature release in normal blood environment.

Since April 2020, control measures to reduce anthropogenic emissions have been gradually reduced. The optical properties of aerosols during the dust transport were affected by meteorological conditions, local environmental conditions and human activities. Therefore, two dust weather processes in March 2018 and March 2020 were screened under similar meteorological fields and transportation paths, which were mainly affected by human activities. Based on lidar data, in East China, compared with 2018, the average aerosol optical depth (AOD) of all types of aerosols at 0-4 km in 2020 decreased by 55.48%, while the AOD of dust aerosols decreased by 43.59%. The average particle depolarization ratio and color ratio decreased by 40.33 and 10.56% respectively. Due to the reduction of anthropogenic emissions in China (detected by lidar), the concentration of surface PM2.5 decreased by 57.47%. This indicated that due to the decrease in human activities caused by COVID-19 control measures, the optical properties of aerosols were significantly reduced during dust weather process in eastern China.

A multi-section questionnaire was sent to each included woman on the first day of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Part-A was finalized to acquire maternal characteristics and to test the women's perception of vaccinations in pregnancy and their fear-induced by vaccines. Part-B included the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) a validated test for scoring trait anxiety (basal anxiety, STAI-T) and state anxiety (STAI-S). An abnormal value of STAI was considered when 40. Comparisons of maternal variables were performed according to their vaccine attitude. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 161 women (80.5% of the population considered). A positive attitude toward the vaccine was present in 136 (84.5%) women (positive) while the remaining 25.5% considered the vaccine not useful (negative). Among the former group 52.9% were favorable to obtain the vaccine during pregnancy despite the current national limitations, a percentage significantly higher (p = .02) than in the negative groups. Women with a negative attitude to the vaccine had a lower educational (p = .002) and employment level (p = .016) when compared to the positive group.

CT reports were reviewed for the exam indication and the presence of predefined acute findings. A two-sample t test was utilized to compare the cohorts. Daily averages were calculated for all measures to control for the sample size difference between each period. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Of the total 751 CT head reports, 290 (38.6%) were ordered during the pandemic and 461 (61.4%) were ordered pre-pandemic. The average daily volume of CT head orders decreased significantly during COVID-19 compared with that during pre-COVID-19 (10.4 scans/day vs 16.5 scans/day; p = 0.001).

We studied the clinical, systemic, mucosal, and cellular responses to two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in 62 individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure that were divided into three groups based on serostatus and/or degree of symptoms: Antibody negative, Asymptomatic, and Symptomatic. In the previously SARS-CoV-2-infected (SARS2-infected) Asymptomatic and Symptomatic groups, symptoms related to a recall response were elicited after the first vaccination. Anti-S trimer IgA and IgG levels peaked after 1st vaccination in the SARS2-infected groups, and were higher that the in the SARS2-naive group in the plasma and nasal samples at all time points. Neutralizing antibodies titers were also higher against the WA-1 and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the SARS2-infected compared to SARS2-naive vaccinees. After the first vaccination, differences in cellular immunity were not evident between groups, but the AIM+ CD4+ cell response correlated with durability of humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In those SARS2-infected, the number of vaccinations needed for protection, the durability, and need for boosters are unknown. However, the lingering differences between the SARS2-infected and SARS2-naive up to 10 months post-vaccination could explain the decreased reinfection rates in the SARS2-infected vaccinees recently reported and suggests that additional strategies (such as boosting of the SARS2-naive vaccinees) are needed to narrow the differences observed between these groups.","output":"Mucosal and systemic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in infection naive and experienced individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abtract Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic brought the need for social distancing as a strategy to control the disease, prompting most countries to te.,mporarily suspend educational activities at all levels.

Therefore, this study aimed to study the chemical polymorphism of natural populations of M. vulgare in Tunisia by quantitative chemical markers and the estimation of divergence between populations. Phytochemical analyses of the eight natural populations of Tunisian Marrubium vulgare prospected in different bioclimatic stages, revealed 42 compounds of essential oils representing 96.08% to 100% of the total oil. Hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes were the main fraction of all the populations studied and ?-bisabolene was the major compound (from 30.11% to 71.35% of the total oil). The phytochemical investigation of the M. vulgare plant indicated the presence of essential oil with significant percentages of phenolic compounds. A significant quantitative and qualitative variation in the essential oils is detected for both major and minor compounds. The principal components analysis (PCA) performed in the single and combined traits provides a good distinction among populations, not according to their geographical and/or bioclimatic origins. Moreover, the phytochemical analysis of the leaves showed that the Tunisian populations, i.e., the populations of Kasserine, Kef, and Beja, were very rich in phenolic compounds (from 20.8 to 44.65 mg GAE/g DW). Flavonoids compounds were also the main class of total polyphenols present in all the tested populations (from 8.91 to 37.48 mg RE/g DW). The quantitative genetic diversity estimated by the population's structure, based on PCA analysis, was an adaptation to the changes in the environmental conditions. Overall, our study indicated that natural populations of M. vulgare had different chemotypes of essential oils and they were rich in phenolic compounds, particularly flavonoids, which opens a new prospect for industrial use and differential exploitation of this species.","output":"Variation of the Chemical Composition of Essential Oils and Total Phenols Content in Natural Populations of Marrubium vulgare L"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a considerably high level of poverty, high population density and relatively fragile health systems, most African countries have a predominance of factors that could contribute to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic Despite these challenges, the continent has shown capacity in its response to the pandemic This may be related to the continent's experience in responding to several infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola disease, Lassa fever and cholera Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several local innovations have been developed and implemented These innovations take into consideration unique circumstances in countries such as multiple government levels, belief in traditional medicine, limited access to medical supplies and others This paper describes the various strategies developed in African countries across leadership and coordination, surveillance, laboratory capacity, case management, infection, prevention and control, risk communications, points of entry, research, logistics and supply chain, partnership, food security and education We highlight the impact of these strategies on the response so far, and lessons that other regions across the world can learn from Africa's response to COVID-19 Finally, we recommend the urgent need for increased investment in African health and social institutions to enable the development of African-owned and led strategies in response to disease outbreaks ?

The estimated 76 million Americans with hypertension represent a significant public health problem, contributing to cardiac, vascular, renal, and neurovascular morbidity and mortality. HTN is the most common indication for lifelong pharmacologic treatment, mainly because of the incontrovertible reductions in cardiovascular events with blood pressure (BP) reduction and control. However, despite the availability and potency of multiple different antihypertensive drugs, up to half of American patients have BPs above the recommended target. Given the overwhelming evidence of both the cost to society of HTN and the benefits that are accrued from improved BP control, alternatives or adjuncts to current management options have been sought to aid in treatment of these patients. Over the past few years, a device-based approach involving modulation of the autonomic nervous system, termed renal denervation, has evolved to meet this challenge. With early trials showing startlingly good results, with few side effects, multiple devices were fast-tracked to clinical trials and hence to the market.

We report behind-the-scenes insights from Australias largest ever investment in the top-down approach, the $45m state-wide scale-up of two childhood obesity programmes. We used Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a template to interpret the organisational embedding of the purpose-built software designed to facilitate the initiative. The use of the technology was mandatory for evaluation, i.e. for reporting the proportion of schools and childcare centres which complied with recommended health practices (the implementation targets). Additionally, the software was recommended as a device to guide the implementation process. We set out to study its use in practice. METHODS: Short-term, high-intensity ethnography with all 14 programme delivery teams across New South Wales was conducted, cross-sectionally, 4 years after scale-up began. The four key mechanisms of NPT (coherence/sensemaking, cognitive participation/engagement, collective action and reflexive monitoring) were used to describe the ways the technology had normalised (embedded). RESULTS: Some teams and practitioners embraced how the software offered a way of working systematically with sites to encourage uptake of recommended practices, while others rejected it as a form of mechanisation. Conscious choices had to be made at an individual and team level about the practice style offered by the technologythus prompting personal sensemaking, re-organisation of work, awareness of choices by others and reflexivity about professional values. Local organisational arrangements allowed technology users to enter data and assist the work of non-userscollective action that legitimised opposite behaviours. Thus, the technology and the programme delivery style it represented were normalised by pathways of adoption and non-adoption. Normalised use and non-use were accepted and different choices made by local programme managers were respected. State-wide, implementation targets are being reported as met. CONCLUSION: We observed a form of self-organisation where individual practitioners and teams are finding their own place in a new system, consistent with complexity-based understandings of fostering scale-up in health care. Self-organisation could be facilitated with further cross-team interaction to continuously renew and revise sensemaking processes and support diverse adoption choices across different contexts.","output":"Scale-up of prevention programmes: sustained state-wide use of programme delivery software is explained by normalised self-organised adoption and non-adoption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Long-acting products are changing the haemophilia A treatment landscape by giving patients and caregivers treatment options with varying product attributes. AIM: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences among patients with haemophilia A and caregivers of children with haemophilia A.

The DCE included a series of questions in which respondents chose their preferred option from pairs of hypothetical treatment profiles with systematic variation in the levels of six attributes (safety concerns with too much clotting, bleed protection, dosing frequency, length of time the product has been approved for use, product type and joint health studies). Preference weights and relative attribute importance scores were estimated using random parameters logit models. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients (mean age: 35.5 years) and 96 caregivers (mean age of child: 10.3 years) were included. For patients with haemophilia A, the top three attributes ranked from the most to least important were: (a) dosing frequency; (b) bleed protection; and (c) safety concerns with too much clotting. For caregivers of children with haemophilia A, the ranking was as follows: (a) safety concerns; (b) bleed protection; and (c) dosing.

In this paper, I analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic joins an already ongoing racial spectacle and system of structural gaslighting organized around racial health disparities in the United States and globally. The field of racial health disparities has yet to question the domain assumptions that uphold its field of investigation; as a result, the entire reform program called for by racial health disparities science is already featured on the menu of the white supremacist power structure. The societal infrastructure that produces scientific knowledge about patterns of health and disease in the human population needs to confront its structural position as part of the racial spectacle organized around racial health disparities in the United States. This paper offers an interpretation of racial antimatter to explain why the data will not save us in the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on articulations of racial spectacle and structural gaslighting within critical race theory and Afropessimist thought. By positioning events in the COVID-19 pandemic together within the same racially speculative frame, I show how the collection of racial health disparities data came up against white supremacists political ambitions in a time-space where the demand for human life to matter and the iterative regeneration of racial antimatter collided.

Mimicking activation of the C2A domain of the Ca2+-sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), by adding a positive charge (Syt1D232N) or increasing its hydrophobicity (Syt14W), lowers the energy barrier. Removing Syt1 or impairing its release inhibitory function (Syt19Pro) increases spontaneous release without affecting the fusion barrier. Both phorbol esters and tetanic stimulation potentiate synaptic strength, and lower the energy barrier equally well in the presence and absence of Syt1. We propose a model where tetanic stimulation activates Syt1-independent mechanisms that lower the energy barrier and act additively with Syt1-dependent mechanisms to produce PTP by exerting multiplicative effects on release rates.","output":"Post-tetanic potentiation lowers the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion independently of Synaptotagmin-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: COVID-19;It is an infectious disease that starts with cold symptoms and causes Acute Respiratory Failure, causing deaths all over the world.

Methods: Data of fractured patients admitted for surgical treatment in the time frames 9 March 2020C4 May 2020 and 1 March 2019C31 May 2019 were collected and compared. Furthermore, surgery duration and some parameters of effectiveness in health management were compared. Results: A total of 498 patients were included. Mean age significantly lower age in 2019 and femoral fractures were significantly more frequent 2020. Mean surgery time was significantly longer in 2020. Mortality rate difference between the two years was found to be statistically significant. Time interval between diagnosis and surgery and between diagnosis and discharge/decease was significantly lower in 2020. In 2020, no patient admitted with a negative swab turned positive in any of the following tests for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the epidemiology of hospitalized patients for traumatic reasons, leading to an increased admission of older patients with femoral fractures.

Here, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence on serial interval distributions and delays in case isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints in PubMed on two epidemiological parameters namely serial intervals and delay intervals relating to isolation of cases for COVID-19 until 22 October, 2020 following predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed the variation in these parameter estimates by correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 103 unique studies identified on serial intervals of COVID-19, 56 were included providing 129 estimates and of 451 unique studies on isolation delays, 18 studies were included providing 74 estimates. Serial interval estimates varied from 1.0 to 9.9 days, while case isolation delays varied from 1.0 to 12.5 days which were associated with spatial, methodological and temporal factors. In mainland China, the pooled mean serial interval was 6.2 (range, 5.1-7.8) days before the epidemic peak and reduced to 4.9 (range, 1.9-6.5) days after the epidemic peak. Similarly, the pooled mean isolation delay related intervals were 6.0 (range, 2.9-12.5) days and 2.4 (range, 2.0-2.7) days before and after the epidemic peak, respectively. There was a positive association between serial interval and case isolation delay. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal factors, such as different control measures and case isolation in particular led to shorter serial interval estimates over time.

Full resequencing of CYP2C9 in a cross-section of this population identified CYP2C9 Met1Leu (M1L), a novel, relatively common single nucleotide polymorphism hypothesized to confer CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype by disrupting the start codon. M1L is present at a minor allele frequency of 6.3% in Yupik Alaska Native people and thus can contribute to the risk of an adverse drug response from narrow-therapeutic-index CYP2C9 substrates such as (S)-warfarin. This studys objective was to characterize the catalytic efficiency of the Leu1 variant enzyme in vivo by evaluating the pharmacokinetic behavior of naproxen, a probe substrate for CYP2C9 activity, in genotyped Yupik participants. We first confirmed the selectivity of (S)-naproxen O-demethylation by CYP2C9 using activity-phenotyped human liver microsomes and selective cytochrome P450 inhibitors and then developed and validated a novel liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method for simultaneous quantification of (S)-naproxen, (S)-O-desmethylnaproxen, and naproxen acyl glucuronide in human urine. The average ratio of (S)-O-desmethylnaproxen to unchanged (S)-naproxen in urine was 18.0  8.0 (n = 11) for the homozygous CYP2C9 Met1 reference group and 10.3  6.6 (n = 11) for the Leu1 variant carrier group (P = 0.011).

Objectives: To develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets. Study design: The multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. Results: The multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays. Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively. Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples. Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected.

Excessive nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental reason for breaking the Blood-Brain/Testi Barrier. Nitric oxide often relates the spread or replication of many viruses in the body. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that synthesizes NO in the human by binding heme to complete the oxygenase reaction. This study focused on the relationship between heme, NO, and the novel coronavirus using bioinformatics methods such as domain search and molecular docking. The results showed ORF8 had three domains similar to nitric oxide synthase : oxygenase, reductase, and calmodulin (CaM). ORF6 could bind to these three domains. The dimer of ORF8 was identical to the dimer of NOS enzyme. The oxygenase domain was in the core, and the reductase domain was on both sides. ORF8 could capture Heme, H4B, L-arginine, FAD, FMN, and NADPH, and bind with CaM protein to catalyze NO production. The heme bound by ORF8 mainly came from the attacked hemoglobin. ORF8 also attached to E protein and synthesized NO through the heme hunted by E protein. We believed NO synthesized by ORF8 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 from reinfecting infected cells and controlled the virus replication speed to avoid cell collapse because of exhaustion of resources. After the SARS-CoV-2 virus combined with an extensive ORF8, the produced NO stream permeably expanded blood vessels and broke the blood-brain/testi barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to nearby tissues through small blood vessel holes created by NO stream. It would increase the tendency to bleed and the blood clotting of the tissue: blood clotting and viral infections severely damaged organs such as the respiratory, heart, nerve, reproductive. Short NO could not open vascular permeability dilation, causing high viral load in asymptomatic patients' blood. Excessive NO stimulated the reproductive organs and generated abnormal functions. It also made abnormal hormone regulation, such as excessive secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). Much LH would hurt the reproductive organs, leading to infertility. Extreme NO also interfered with the human NO signaling pathway and damaged the immune nerve, metabolism, cardiovascular and other systems. This theory is for academic discussion only.

Through extensive computational analyses we show that a chimeric ACE2-Fc construct mimics the ACE2 dimer, normally present on host cells membranes, better than its soluble truncated form. We demonstrate that ACE2-Fc functionalized gFET is effective for in vitro detection of Spike and outperforms the same chip functionalized with either a diagnostic antibody or the soluble ACE2. Our sensor is implemented in a portable, wireless, point-of-care device and successfully detected both alpha and gamma virus variants in patient clinical samples.

Cardiovascular complications secondary to the infection have caught notice. This study aims to delineate the relationship of cardiac biomarkers and outcomes in severe cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One hundred forty-eight critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. From these patients, the demographic data, symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Four patients in the non-survivor group were selected, and their cardiac biomarkers were collected and analyzed. Among the 148 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular complications was 19 (12.8%). Five of them were survivors (5.2%), and 14 of them were non-survivors (26.9%). Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors had higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB, myoglobin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P < 0.05). The occurrence of cardiovascular events began at 11-15 days after the onset of the disease and reached a peak at 14-20 days. COVID-19 not only is a respiratory disease but also causes damage to the cardiovascular system.

Starting with design principles, we propose a natural syntactic extension of the MATCH clause of popular graph query languages. We then formally present the semantics of TRPQs, and study the complexity of their evaluation. We show that TRPQs can be evaluated in polynomial time if TPGs are time-stamped with time points, and identify fragments of the TRPQ language that admit efficient evaluation over a more succinct interval-annotated representation. Finally, we implement a fragment of the language in a state-of-the-art dataflow framework, and experimentally demonstrate that TRPQ can be evaluated efficiently.","output":"Temporal Regular Path Queries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University buildings are significant closed built environments for COVID-19 spreading. As universities prepare to re-start in-class activities, students' adherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. While physical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of students inside common spaces can pose higher risks due to individuals' proximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional student flow inside a case-study university building, by investigating students' movements and grouping behaviour according to physical distancing requirements. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical distancing guidance, but some spaces, such as corridors, pose higher exposure than doorways. Their width, in combination with group behaviour, affects the students' capacity to keep the recommended distance. Furthermore, students report higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors. Evidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding individuals' exposure in universities and researchers in developing behavioural models in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.","output":"How distant?

Their effectiveness is, however, dependent on the uptake of such COVID-19 apps. OBJECTIVE: We examined the role of individuals general health status in their willingness to use a COVID-19 tracing app as well as the roles of socioeconomic characteristics and COVID-19 proximity. METHODS: We drew data from the WageIndicator Foundation Living and Working in Coronavirus Times survey. The survey collected data on labor market status as well as the potential confounders of the relationship between general health and COVID-19 tracing app usage, such as sociodemographics and regular smartphone usage data. The survey also contained information that allowed us to examine the role of COVID-19 proximity, such as whether an individual has contracted SARS-CoV-2, whether an individual has family members and colleagues with COVID-19, and whether an individual exhibits COVID-19 pandemicCinduced depressive and anxiety symptoms. We selected data that were collected in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands from individuals aged between 18 and 70 years (N=4504). Logistic regressions were used to measure individuals willingness to use a COVID-19 tracing app. RESULTS: We found that the influence that socioeconomic factors have on COVID-19 tracing app usage varied dramatically between the four countries, although individuals experiencing forms of not being employed (ie, recent job loss and inactivity) consistently had a lower willingness to use a contact tracing app (effect size: 24.6%) compared to that of employees (effect size: 33.4%; P<.001). Among the selected COVID-19 proximity indicators, having a close family member with SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with higher contact tracing app usage (effect size: 36.3% vs 27.1%; P<.001). After accounting for these proximity factors and the country-based variations therein, we found that having a poorer general health status was significantly associated with a much higher likelihood of contact tracing app usage; compared to a self-reported very good health status (estimated probability of contact tracing app use: 29.6%), the good (estimated probability: +4.6%; 95% CI 1.2%-8.1%) and fair or bad (estimated probability: +6.3%; 95% CI 2.3%-10.3%) health statuses were associated with a markedly higher willingness to use a COVID-19 tracing app. CONCLUSIONS: Current public health policies aim to promote the use of smartphone-based contact tracing apps during the off-peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Campaigns that emphasize the health benefits of COVID-19 tracing apps may contribute the most to the uptake of such apps. Public health campaigns that rely on digital platforms would also benefit from seriously considering the country-specific distribution of privacy concerns.","output":"The Roles of General Health and COVID-19 Proximity in Contact Tracing App Usage: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The specific effect of RNA interference on the replication of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHE-CoV) was explored. METHODS: Four species of small interfering RNA (siRNA), targeting different regions of the PHE-CoV spike glycoprotein and replicase polyprotein genes, were prepared by in vitro transcription. After transfection of PK-15 cells with each of the siRNAs followed by infection with PHE-CoV, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was examined by phase-contrast microscope, and viral proliferation within cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, hemagglutination (HA) test, TCID(50) assay and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Examination of CPE demonstrated that the four siRNAs were capable of protecting cells against PHE-CoV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. At 48 h post-infection, only a few siRNA-treated cells were positive for viral antigen staining, whereas most untreated virus-infected cells were positive. Transfection with siRNAs also suppressed the production of infectious virus by up to 18- to 32-fold as assessed by a HA test and 93- to 494-fold as assessed by TCID(50) assay. Furthermore, treatment with siRNAs caused a 53-91% reduction in the viral genome copy number as assessed by real-time RT-PCR.

These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

Evaluation of these forecasts with a weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the transmission rate, and allows for parameters to vary over time according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and applicability to large multivariate data sets that may prove useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts.","output":"A semi-parametric, state-space compartmental model with time-dependent parameters for forecasting COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a common type of salivary gland malignancy; however, rarely, MEC can arise from the lung.

Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) can avoid a penalty through low baseline readmission rates or improvement over time. OBJECTIVE: To assess the baseline performance and improvement over time of SNFs in the SNF VBP program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study examined readmission rates, financial penalties and incentives, and facility and patient characteristics associated with these outcomes at 14 959 US SNFs that received Medicare payments between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were readmission rates and financial penalties by facility. The SNFs were classified as improvers in the analysis if they had better improvement scores than baseline scores under the program and achievers if they had higher baseline scores than improvement scores. RESULTS: Of 14 959 SNFs studied, 1849 (12.3%) were assigned their improvement score as their performance score in the first year of the program. Of these, 1167 (63.1%) received a financial penalty, whereas 374 (20.2%) received a bonus. Only 52 facilities that performed poorly at baseline (0.3% of all SNFs and 0.7% of below-median performers) were able to improve enough to avoid a financial penalty, despite large improvements in readmission rates. Improver SNFs treated larger racial minority populations (mean [SD], 74.57% [23.42%] White in the improver group vs 79.15% [22.18%] in the achiever group) and were located in counties with larger minority populations (mean [SD], 15.48% [14.05%] Black in the improver group vs 11.57% [12.72%] Black in the achiever group). The most important predictors of improvement were related to SNF finances, such as operating margin (mean [SD], ?0.74 [13.87]) and occupancy rates (mean [SD], 79.93 [14.81]).

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from inception to July 22, 2021. Observational studies that examined the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among people vaccinated were included. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled vaccine effectiveness (VE) and incidence rate of adverse events after vaccination, and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 58 studies (32 studies for vaccine effectiveness and 26 studies for vaccine safety) were included. A single dose of vaccines was 41% (95% CI: 28C54%) effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, 52% (31C73%) for symptomatic COVID-19, 66% (50C81%) for hospitalization, 45% (42C49%) for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, and 53% (15C91%) for COVID-19-related death; and two doses were 85% (81C89%) effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, 97% (97C98%) for symptomatic COVID-19, 93% (89C96%) for hospitalization, 96% (93C98%) for ICU admissions, and 95% (92C98%) effective for COVID-19-related death, respectively. The pooled VE was 85% (80C91%) for the prevention of Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 75% (71C79%) for the Beta variant, 54% (35C74%) for the Gamma variant, and 74% (62C85%) for the Delta variant. The overall pooled incidence rate was 1.5% (1.4C1.6%) for adverse events, 0.4 (0.2C0.5) per 10 000 for severe adverse events, and 0.1 (0.1C0.2) per 10 000 for death after vaccination.

Grocery shopping presents increased potential for COVID-19 infection because customers and store employees are in proximity to each other. This study investigated shoppers' perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks and put them in context by comparing grocery shopping to other activities outside home, and examined whether a proactive preventive action by grocery stores influence shoppers' perceived risk of COVID-19 infection.

We found significant factors associated with high levels of risk perception on grocery shoppers. We identified some effective preventive actions that grocery stores implement to alleviate anxiety and risk perception. We found that people are generally more concerned about in-store grocery shopping relative to other out-of-home activities. Findings suggest that a strict policy requiring grocery store employees to use facemasks and gloves greatly reduced shoppers' perceived risk rating of infection of themselves by 37.5% and store employees by 51.2%.

Furthermore, IL28B genotype is associated with changes of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. A further GWAS demonstrated that ITPA genetic variants protect HCV genotype 1 patients from RBV\\\\induced anaemia. Another polymorphism in the patatin\\\\like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with hepatic steatosis. Difficult\\\\to\\\\treat hepatitis C patients homozygous for GG had an up to five\\\\fold lower chance of viral clearance on PEG/RBV than non\\\\GG patients. In chronic hepatitis B patients treated with PEG\\\\IFN several retrospective analyses of IL28B rs12980275 and rs12979860 genotypes yielded conflicting results which can be explained by the heterogeneity between the study populations.

Methods: We carried out a nationwide study including 24,117 participants aged 60 years and older in China using a multistage clustered sampling. Dementia and AD were diagnosed according to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the criteria issued by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Face-to-face interviews were administered by the trained interviewers to obtain information on demographics, lifestyle factors, and previous diseases. Results: The overall weighted prevalence of dementia was 4.22% (95%CI 2.27-6.17%) for people aged 60 years and older, was higher in women than in men and increased with age. Daily tea drinking and daily exercises were the protective factors for both dementia and AD. Engaging in social and intellectual activities was significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia and AD. Conclusions: A large number of population with dementia posed a significant challenge to China where the population is rapidly aging. The increase of public awareness, building more care facilities, and training dementia specialists and professional caregivers are all urgently needed and should be the future priorities of dementia care in China.","output":"Prevalence of Dementia in China in 2015: A Nationwide Community-Based Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The German change of attitude concerning fiscal policy and the mutualisation of efforts to fight the pandemic is driven by self-interest, and as such might be structural","output":"Europe After COVID-19: A New Role for German Leadership?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected social and economic activities in the agriculture systems. The extent of pandemic disruptions on agriculture food production systems is lamentably scanty in rural areas. A survey was carried out in the Northern Drakensberg areas of Bergville, and it assessed the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural food production in smallholder farming systems comprising crop-livestock systems. A survey was conducted using structured questionnaires that measured the impact of COVID-19 within farming operations and average crop yield trends pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Most farmers (77.1 to 92.4%) reported having limitations in accessing agricultural inputs of seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated a continuous decrease in yields of maize, dry beans, and soybeans across two years of cropping seasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrated that COVID-19 lockdowns accompanied by movement restrictions negatively impacted food production of staple crops (maize, dry beans, soybeans) despite suitable rains received during COVID-19 production periods. COVID-19 policies and legislations sensitive to the plight of poor rural communities are necessary as these communities are more reliant on local agricultural food production for their livelihoods and income. Strong co-operations must be established among input suppliers, smallholder farmers associations, extension services, and local retailers to assist smallholders to obtain inputs at local retailers even during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Agricultural Food Production among Smallholder Farmers in Northern Drakensberg Areas of Bergville, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery represents a significant workload for ophthalmologists in Ireland. Post-operative shared care with community optometrists can reduce the need for hospital follow-up appointments. AIMS: Eight years after the introduction of a shared-care pathway, we wished to quantify the proportion of patients discharged to the community for post-operative follow-up, and the number that re-present to the hospital due to cataract-related issues. METHODS: We collected data on all patients who underwent cataract surgery in our centre over a three month period. Electronic patient records were used to establish whether the patient was discharged on the day of surgery, and whether they re-attended the department post-operatively. Post-operative complications were recorded. RESULTS: 394 cataract procedures were carried out over the three months. 369 patients were discharged to an optometrist for their post-operative care. Of those, 38 were re-referred or re-presented to the hospital ophthalmic service. 21 of these had a post-operative complication. Complications included seven cases of post-operative uveitis, 5 patients with cystoid macular oedema, one retinal detachment and one retained lens fragment.

However, upon viral infection or Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation, LSECs can achieve proinflammatory functions, but their role in hepatic inflammation during acute viral hepatitis is unknown. Using the highly virulent mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) and the attenuated variants 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3, exhibiting lower tropism for LSECs, we investigated in vivo and in vitro the consequence of LSEC infection on their proinflammatory profiles and the aggravation of acute hepatitis process. In vivo infection with virulent MHV3, in comparison to attenuated strains, resulted in fulminant hepatitis associated with higher hepatic viral load, tissue necrosis, and levels of inflammatory mediators and earlier recruitment of inflammatory cells. Such hepatic inflammatory disorders correlated with disturbed production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and vascular factors by LSECs. We next showed in vitro that infection of LSECs by the virulent MHV3 strain altered their production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoted higher release of proinflammatory and procoagulant factors and earlier cell damage than infection by attenuated strains. This higher replication and proinflammatory activation in LSECs by the virulent MHV3 strain was associated with a specific activation of TLR2 signaling by the virus. We provide evidence that TLR2 activation of LSCEs by MHV3 is an aggravating factor of hepatic inflammation and correlates with the severity of hepatitis. Taken together, these results indicate that preservation of the immunotolerant properties of LSECs during acute viral hepatitis is imperative in order to limit hepatic inflammation and damage. IMPORTANCE Viral hepatitis B and C infections are serious health problems affecting over 350 million and 170 million people worldwide, respectively. It has been suggested that a balance between protection and liver damage mediated by the host's immune response during the acute phase of infection would be determinant in hepatitis outcome. Thus, it appears crucial to identify the factors that predispose in exacerbating liver inflammation to limit hepatocyte injury. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) can express both anti- and proinflammatory functions, but their role in acute viral hepatitis has never been investigated. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infections as animal models of viral hepatitis, we report for the first time that in vitro and in vivo infection of LSECs by the pathogenic MHV3 serotype leads to a reversion of their intrinsic anti-inflammatory phenotype toward a proinflammatory profile as well to as disorders in vascular factors, correlating with the severity of hepatitis. These results highlight a new virus-promoted mechanism of exacerbation of liver inflammatory response during acute hepatitis.","output":"Mouse Hepatitis Virus Infection Induces a Toll-Like Receptor 2-Dependent Activation of Inflammatory Functions in Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells during Acute Hepatitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the changing trends in dermatology clinical practice at a tertiary center during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to design a multimodal approach to a food art therapy (MM-FAT) program and identify its effects on cognitive ability, daily living functioning, depression, self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-expression, and social functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia by employing a mixed methods research design. METHODS The participants included 39 patients from a public dementia care centre in Seoul, Korea. The intervention group, which comprised 20 participants, received 12 MM-FAT sessions 3 times a week for 4 weeks, and the control group, which included 19 participants, received usual care. The MM-FAT program was evaluated based on its effectiveness on cognitive, daily living, emotional, and social functioning outcome measures at three time points using repeated measures analysis of variance. Semi-structured interviews (n = 9) were conducted to evaluate the overall experience of the MM-FAT program and its outcomes. RESULTS The findings reveal that MM-FAT has a positive effect on the cognitive, emotional, and social functioning of individuals with MCI and mild dementia. However, there were no enhancements in individuals' daily living functioning, and the lasting effects of the intervention could not be assessed. Cognition and depression increased significantly at the end of the MM-FAT program. Self-expression and self-efficacy were significantly higher in the MM-FAT group than in the control group. The semi-structured interviews revealed improvements in participants' behaviour, communication, and interaction. CONCLUSION This mixed methods study focused on individuals with MCI or mild dementia contributes to an understanding of the effectiveness of a FAT program employing a multimodal approach.

To date, however, there has been limited insight into the nature and the extent of aging-related alterations in internal face representations. Here, we sought to address these issues by using an image reconstruction approach that capitalizes on the structure of behavioral data to reveal the pictorial content of visual representations. To this end, healthy young and older adults provided similarity judgments with pairs of face images. Facial shape and surface features were subsequently derived from the structure of the data for each participant and combined into image reconstructions of facial appearance. Our findings revealed that image reconstruction was successful for every participant, irrespective of age. However, reconstruction accuracies of shape and surface information were lower for older individuals than young individuals. Specifically, facial features diagnostic for face perception, such as eye shape and skin tone, were reconstructed poorly in older adults relative to young adults. At the same time, we found that age-related effects only accounted for a relatively small proportion of individual variability in face representations. Thus, our results provide novel insight into age-related changes in visual perception, they account for the decline in facial recognition occurring with age and they demonstrate the utility of image reconstruction to uncovering internal representations across a variety of populations.","output":"Image Reconstruction Reveals the Impact of Aging on Face Perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Mental health stigma is a major barrier to seeking help, and leads to poor quality of life and social withdrawal for individuals living with mental illness. These concerns are especially severe in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that face a disproportionate share of the global burden of mental illnesses. With growing access to digital technologies in LMICs, there may be new opportunities to address mental health stigma. This review considers the potential for emerging digital technologies to advance efforts to challenge mental health stigma in LMICs. Methods Promising digital strategies to reduce mental health stigma were identified through searching the peer-reviewed literature. Drawing from the Mental Illness Stigma Framework, these studies of digital strategies were grouped into three categories: 1) protest;2) education, and 3) contact. Results These three categories align with established stigma reduction programs. Digital strategies could expand the reach of or complement existing efforts. There are challenges with digital stigma reduction strategies, including the need for cultural adaptation of these programs to diverse contexts and settings, consideration of reliable measurement of mental health related stigma, and risks that digital media could perpetuate the spread of misinformation and exacerbate concerns pertaining to mental health stigma. Conclusion This review highlights the promise of technology for addressing mental health stigma in LMICs. This is imperative in the face of growing demand for mental health services owing to the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing reliance on digital platforms among individuals in most countries.","output":"Addressing mental health stigma in low-income and middle-income countries: A new frontier for digital mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is considered the largest immunological organ, with a diverse gut microbiota, that contributes to combatting pathogens and maintaining human health. Under physiological conditions, the crosstalk between gut microbiota and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) plays a crucial role in GIT homeostasis. Gut microbiota and derived metabolites can compromise gut barrier integrity by activating some signaling pathways in IECs. Conversely, IECs can separate the gut microbiota from the host immune cells to avoid an excessive immune response and regulate the composition of the gut microbiota by providing an alternative energy source and releasing some molecules, such as hormones and mucus. Infections by various pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, can disturb the diversity of the gut microbiota and influence the structure and metabolism of IECs. However, the interaction between gut microbiota and IECs during infection is still not clear. In this review, we will focus on the existing evidence to elucidate the crosstalk between gut microbiota and IECs during infection and discuss some potential therapeutic methods, including probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and dietary fiber.

We established a VCPLAT prediction model based on data mining and machine learning. We first performed the correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) to provide high-quality feature combinations. Based on this, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm was to establish a prediction model with powerful performance. Finally, we verified the validity and superiority of the proposed method via comparison with other prediction models in similar works. After 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed prediction method had the best performance and its explained variance score (EVS), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), median absolute error (MedAE) and R(2) were 0.949, 0.028, 0.002, 0.045, 0.015 and 0.948, respectively.

The primary immunological endpoint was seroresponse defined as an anti-rotavirus IgA level < 20 AU/ml, approximately one month following Rotarix or placebo. Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02941107). Findings: Between March 2018 and August 2020, 253 infants were enrolled. Of these, 178 infants (70%) had analysable serological results after follow-up; 89 randomised to Rotarix and 89 randomised to placebo.

The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine. In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015. An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined. This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response. Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations. In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine. Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks. All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks. For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national health care system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine.","output":"Global Telemedicine Implementation and Integration Within Health Systems to Fight the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Call to Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The body of evidence related to the effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions has grown over the recent years. However, the effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions in older adults remains unclear and should be systematically reviewed. Objective The objective of this systematic review was to estimate the effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions on physical activity behavior in participants aged 65 and above. Subsequently we explored the effect on body mass index, physical capacity, and health-related quality of life and finally the impact of patient- and intervention characteristics. Methods Searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were performed on April 26, 2018. No publication date filters were applied. References of eligible studies were scrutinized and relevant journals were hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials and randomized cross-over trials investigating the effect of a physical activity monitor-based intervention on physical activity were included. Studies were included if the mean age of the participants was above 65 years, and participants could walk independently with or without walking aids. The Cochrane handbook was used as a template for extracting data and the RoB 2.0 tool was used to assess risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis using Hedges g, were used to pool the study results. The main outcome of this study was physical activity. Results Twenty-one studies with 2783 participants were included. The median participant age in the studies was 70.5 years, the median percentage of male participants was 42%, and the median baseline daily step count was 5268. Physical activity monitor-based interventions had a moderate effect (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73) compared to control interventions, corresponding to an average increase of 1297 steps per day in the intervention groups. No impact of patient and intervention characteristics on the effect estimates were found. Short conclusion Low quality of evidence was found for a moderate effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions on physical activity compared with control interventions.

This resistance causes an increase in mortality rate because strains resistant to antimicrobial agents are a major challenge for physicians and healthcare workers regarding the eradication of either hospital or community-based infections. These strains with emerging resistance are a serious issue for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Antibiotic resistance has increased because of the acquirement of mobile genetic elements such as transposons, plasmids, and integrons and causes the prevalence of multidrug resistance strains (MDR). In addition, an increase in carbapenem resistance, which is used as last line antibiotic treatment to eliminate infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, is a major concern. Carbapenems resistant A. baumannii (CR-Ab) is a worldwide problem. Because these strains are often resistant to all other commonly used antibiotics. Therefore, pathogenic multi-drug resistance A. baumannii (MDR-Ab) associated infections become hard to eradicate. Plasmid-mediated resistance causes outbreaks of extensive drug-resistant. A. baumannii (XDR-Ab). In addition, recent outbreaks relating to livestock and community settings illustrate the existence of large MDR-Ab strain reservoirs within and outside hospital settings. The purpose of this review, proper monitoring, prevention, and treatment are required to control (XDR-Ab) infections.

Methods: Four focus group discussions among recovered COVID-19 patients were organized and conducted via video conference to collect their insights on public health messages. Upon culmination of each discussion, we held debrief sessions with a particular focus on the responses and making notes of comments. Qualitative themes were also recorded at the end of each focus group. Results: All 40 participants were COVID-19 recovered cases. The participants' mean age was 33.4+/-28.5 years, and 70.0% (n = 28) were males. We observed a generally positive attitude towards public health messages. However, it was stressed that the nature of such behavioral change posed a significant risk for psychological health. Lack of social interaction, for example, led to lower motivation, a sense of losing the meaning of life, and personal distress. While all participants acknowledged and appreciated the government authorities' efforts in disseminating and educating the masses on such a large scale using different modes of message delivery, all showed a serious concern as to whether they will be able to continue coping with the ongoing situation. Conclusions: The participants' responses suggest that public health messaging brought a significant social change in Oman. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized.

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and narratively analysed. RESULTS: Eighteen senior and junior physicians involved in 21 patient case studies were interviewed. Analysis determined two predominant themes: key moral distress triggers; and strategies and consequences. Junior residents reported most instances of moral distress, triggered by perceived futility, lack of continuity, protracted decisions and failure to ensure 'good death'. Senior physicians' triggers included constraint of clinical autonomy. Moral distress was far reaching, affecting personal life, working relationships and career choice.

This paper aims to address two important policy related issues, that is which agricultural subsector suffers more under zoonotic diseases and how do zoonotic diseases affect these subsectors. Using provincial panel data of 24 main farm commodities in China from 2002 to 2017, this paper identifies the impacts of zoonotic diseases and projects the potential disruption of COVID-19 to agricultural output in China under three scenarios. The main findings are as follows. First, zoonotic diseases have adverse impacts on almost all the farm commodities, while livestock on average suffers more than crops. Second, zoonotic diseases affect these subsectors mainly through the channel of adverse shocks on total factor productivity (TFP). Third, while a few subsectors can find a way to offset part of the TFP loss by applying more input, most subsectors suffer from both input reduction and TFP loss. Fourth, the spread of COVID-19 is projected to lower the growth rates of China's crop and livestock sector by 1.1%C2.3% and 1.3%C2.6%, with TFP loss by 1.1%C2.0% and 1.4%C2.7%, respectively, in 2020.

Physical activity offers several health benefits for women with PCOS. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the effect of different types of exercise on reproductive function and body composition for women with PCOS. METHODS This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following recommended review methods. We searched 6 databases: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature; Embase; MEDLINE (via Ovid); PubMed; Sport Discus; and Web of Science; and we developed search strategies using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms and text words related to exercise interventions for women with PCOS. There was no restriction on language or publication year. The search was conducted on April 16, 2019 and updated on November 15, 2019. Two authors independently screened citations, determined risk of bias and quality of evidence with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. We conducted meta-analyses following recommended guidelines, and report results using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Ten RCTs (n = 533) were included in this review. Studies tested the following interventions: aerobic, resistance, and combined (aerobic/resistance) training programs. Most studies were small (average 32, range 15-124 participants), and of relatively short duration (8-32 weeks). There was high heterogeneity for outcomes of reproductive function (menstrual cycle, ovulation, and fertility). We noted low certainty evidence for little to no effect of exercise on reproductive hormones and moderate certainty evidence that aerobic exercise reduced body mass index (BMI) in women with PCOS: BMI SMD -0.35, 95% confidence interval -0.56 to -0.14, P = .001. CONCLUSION For women with PCOS, evidence is limited to discern the effect of exercise on major health outcomes (e.g., reproductive function). There is moderate certainty evidence that aerobic exercise alone is beneficial for reducing BMI in women with PCOS. Future studies should be conducted with longer duration, larger sample sizes, and should provide detailed information on menstrual cycle and fertility outcomes.PROSPERO Systematic review registration: 2017 CRD42017058869.","output":"The effect of exercise as an intervention for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is the remote practice of medicine through the use of information and communication technologies for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases. In this narrative review, we illustrate how telemedicine technologies are increasingly integrated into pediatric infectious disease programs with the aim of facilitating access to specialist care and reducing costs. There is widespread use of telemedicine for the management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, particularly in countries in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas, far from third-level hospital centers located in large urban centers. Obviously, telemedicine is also used in developed countries, and its importance has been further increased recently given the COVID-19 pandemic. It has many advantages for patients, such as saving time, money and working hours, and reducing cancelled appointments and delays, while there are also many advantages for doctors, allowing collaborations with specialists and continuous updating. Among the disadvantages are the limitation in carrying out an objective examination, which is particularly important for children under 2 years of age, and the need for cutting-edge technology and reliable connectivity. Telemedicine increasingly represents the future and the beginning of a new healthcare system that also will redefine medical care for the treatment of infectious diseases, both acute and chronic.

However, the AB is modulated when targets are emotional, and is evoked when a task-irrelevant, emotional critical distractor (CDI) replaces T1. Neither manipulation fully captures the interplay between bottom-up and top-down attention in the AB: Valenced targets intrinsically conflate top-down and bottom-up attention. The CDI approach cannot manipulate second target (T2) valence, which is critical because valenced T2s can break through the AB (in the target-manipulation approach). The present research resolves this methodological challenge by indirectly measuring whether a purely bottom-up CDI can modulate report of a subsequent T2. This novel approach adds a valenced CDI to the classic, two-target AB. Participants viewed RSVP streams containing a T1CCDI pair preceding a variable lag to T2. If the CDIs valence is sufficient to survive the AB, it should modulate T2 performance, indirectly signaling bottom-up capture by an emotional stimulus. Contrary to this prediction, CDI valence only affected the AB when CDIs were also extremely visually conspicuous. Thus, emotional valence alone is insufficient to modulate the AB.","output":"Nontarget emotional stimuli must be highly conspicuous to modulate the attentional blink"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many countries, health care institutions have ramped down nonemergent activities in order to free up hospital and critical care beds in anticipation of a wave of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

These host responses contribute to pulmonary damage leading to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. In order to effectively treat severe and late-stage pneumonias, use of adjunctive therapies must be considered to reduce pulmonary damage when antimicrobial agents can be administered. Pneumonic plague, a severe pneumonia caused by inhalation of Yersinia pestis, is a fatal disease that causes death within 6 days without antibiotic intervention. Late-stage pneumonic plague is difficult to treat, as antibiotics must be delivered within 24 h after onset of symptoms to be effective. Here, we use a murine model of primary pneumonic plague to examine how host inflammatory responses impact antibiotic treatment of late-stage pneumonic plague. We developed a murine infection model demonstrating the poor outcomes associated with delayed delivery of antibiotics. We show that pretreatment of mice with intranasal fluticasone propionate increased the efficacy of delayed antibiotic delivery and enhanced murine survival. Mice receiving fluticasone propionate also showed decreased bacterial burden and reduced inflammatory pathology in the lungs. Further, we show that treatment and survival correlated with decreased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and reduced neutrophil infiltration to the lungs.

DESIGN: A facility-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: 25 health facilities across three counties of Kenya: Nairobi, Kisumu and Kakamega. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5 879 low-income pregnant women aged 13C49 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Ordinary least squares, Poisson and logistic regression models were employed, to predict three key determinants of the continuum of maternal care: (i) the week of enrolment at the clinic for antenatal care (ANC), (ii) the total number of ANC visits and (iii) utilisation of skilled birth attendance (SBA). The interrelationship between the three outcome variables was assessed with structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Each week of delayed enrolment in ANC reduced the number of ANC visits by 3% (incidence rate ratio=0.967, 95% CI 0.965 to 0.969). A higher number of ANC visits increased the relative probability of using SBA (odds ratio=1.28, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.34). The direct association between late enrolment and SBA was positive (odds ratio=1.033, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04). Predisposing factors (age, household heads education), enabling factors (wealth, shorter distance, rural area) and need factors (risk level of pregnancy, multigravida) were positively associated with adherence to ANC. CONCLUSION: The results point towards a domino-effect and underscore the importance of enhancing the full continuum of maternal care. A larger number of ANC visits increases SBA, while early initiation of the care journey increases the number of ANC visits, thereby indirectly supporting SBA as well. These beneficial pathways counteract the direct link between enrolment and SBA, which is partly driven by pregnant teenagers who both enrol late and are at heightened risk of complications, stressing the need for specific attention to this vulnerable population.","output":"What prevents pregnant women from adhering to the continuum of maternal care?

Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. METHOD Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. RESULTS Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats. CONCLUSIONS Results provide preliminary evidence that videoconference group CBT for anxiety and related disorders may be a promising and effective alternative to face-to-face CBT. Additional research is needed to establish equivalence between these delivery formats.","output":"Face-to-face versus Video Teleconference Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Anxiety and Related Disorders: A Preliminary Comparison: Thrapie cognitivo-comportementale de groupe en personne contre par vido tlconfrence pour l'anxit et les troubles connexes: une comparaison prliminaire."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization issued interim guidelines on essential health system preparedness and response measures for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

About half of the participants attributed a low score regarding the health systems preparedness (44.4%), its response (50.0%), and its overall performance (55.6%) to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an association between participants age and work experience and their overall perceptions of preparedness and response (p = 0.009 and p = 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION: More than half of the participants gave a low score to the MHD regarding the health systems preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The safety of performing breast reconstruction during the pandemic was unknown. This study aims to review the safety of performing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction during the first COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction by Massachusetts General Hospital breast and plastic surgeons immediately preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (34 breasts) underwent mastectomies with immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 restriction period in Massachusetts. Most reconstructions were unilateral. All reconstructions were performed with implants or expanders, and no autologous reconstructions were performed. Two patients (2 breasts) had operative complications. The complication rate during the pandemic was similar to the complication rate pre-pandemic. No patients or surgeons experienced symptoms or positive COVID-19 tests. Over 90% of patients were discharged the same day. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic breast reconstruction was able to be performed safely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic surge in Massachusetts.

The prevalence of such claims on individual clinic websites has previously been reported as approximately one-in-four in Denmark. The underlying rationales for such claims may reflect convictions about traditional chiropractic subluxations paradigms, but are not self-evident and has not previously been studied. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative case interview study of Danish chiropractors with websites which contain claims about chiropractic efficacy in the treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders. Websites were identified from a nation wide random sample (57%) of all chiropractic clinic websites. RESULTS: Of the original 139 websites, 36 were identified as mentioning non-MSK conditions. When revisited, 19 of those clinic websites still mentioned non-MSK disorders and were contacted. Eleven (11) declined our invitation to participate. Interviews were conducted with the responsible chiropractor from each of the remaining 8 clinics. Five distinct themes were identified in the rationales for treating non-musculoskeletal disorders: Positive side-effects, Experience, Web page, Communication and Conviction. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of Danish chiropractic websites suggest that non-musculoskeletal disorders are within the chiropractic scope of practice. Those that do, do so for varying reasonspoor communication and website maintenance were commonly cited problems. An explicitly stated adherence to traditional chiropractic subluxations concepts was uncommon. By contrast, a more tempered rationale that suggested a potential beneficial side-effect of chiropractic on non-musculoskeletal health issues were more common and was typically presented in softer-language and/or with some reservations.

Methods: Using ICD-9 codes, we analyzed Ibermutua records of all sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020, compared to during the same months of 2017, 2018, and 2019. We stratified the analysis by causes, patient sex, activity sectors, and regional data. All sick leaves were adjusted by the number of Ibermutua-affiliated persons in each period. Results: In March 2020, there was an unprecedented (116%) increase in total sick leaves, mainly due to infectious and respiratory diseases. Men and women were equally affected. All activity sectors were impacted, with the highest increase (457%) observed among health-related workers, especially due to contagious disease. The incidences of sick leaves were heterogeneous among different regions. Cost-analysis of sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020 compared with in previous years showed 40.3% increment (mean 2,813 vs. 2,005  per 100 affiliated workers).

Both theory and research suggest that people living in densely populated urban areas are more likely to smoke than those living in less densely populated areas. Consequently, non-smokers in densely populated urban areas might be more likely to be exposed and feel annoyed by secondhand smoke outdoors. We investigated whether the extent to which non-smokers feel annoyed by secondhand smoke exposure in outdoor public spaces is related to urban population density. METHODS: We used cross-sectional survey data from the Netherlands Module Substance Use survey (2020 data, n=9375). This is a nationally representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. Using logistic regression models, we investigated whether urban population density predicts both smoking and non-smokers annoyance to secondhand smoke exposure outdoors. RESULTS: We found that smoking rates were associated with urban population density. In the Netherlands, people living in extremely population-dense urban areas were more likely to smoke than those living in non-urban areas (AOR=1.59; 95% CI: 1.25C2.02, p<0.001). Feeling annoyed by secondhand smoke outdoors was also associated with urban population density: non-smokers living in extremely population-dense urban areas were more likely to be annoyed than respondents living in non-urban areas (AOR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.34C2.02, p<0.001).

This study assessed whether ambulance dispatch data are suitable for influenza surveillance. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of a time series of ambulance dispatch data from Melbourne, Australia for the years 1997C2005 with locum service and general practice (GP) sentinel surveillance data for influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: All data were aggregated into 1-week periods, corresponding to the data collection period used in the GP sentinel surveillance system, which was used as the reference system. Rates of ambulance dispatches classified to respiratory or breathing problems per 1000 total dispatches were compared with rates of callouts for flu or influenza per 1000 locum calls, and rates of ILI per 1000 patients from the sentinel GPs. Signals from the ambulance data were generated using the log likelihood ratio CUSUM, a method of continuous monitoring suitable for surveillance. RESULTS: The ambulance dispatch data displayed seasonal trends that were similar to those observed in locum service surveillance and GP sentinel systems, and identified the years with higher-than-expected seasonal ILI activity (1998 and 2003) and the epidemic year (1997). However, there was a high baseline rate of ambulance calls classified to respiratory or breathing problems (90C100 per 1000 calls) in months where there was minimal influenza activity.

Therefore, its vaccine has been developed and made available for public use in unprecedented times. However, because of various levels of hesitancy, it did not have general acceptance. The main objective of this work is to identify the risk associated with the COVID-19 vaccines by developing a prognosis tool that will help in enhancing its acceptability and therefore, reducing the lethality of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The obtained raw VAERS dataset has three files indicating medical history, vaccination status, and post vaccination symptoms respectively with more than 354 thousand samples. After pre-processing, this raw dataset has been merged into one with 85 different attributes however, the whole analysis has been subdivided into three scenarios ((i) medical history (ii) reaction of vaccination (iii) combination of both). Further, Machine Learning (ML) models which includes Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm (LGBM), and Multilayer feed-forward perceptron (MLP) have been employed to predict the most probable outcome and their performance has been evaluated based on various performance parameters. Also, the chi-square (statistical), LR, RF, and LGBM have been utilized to estimate the most probable attribute in the dataset that resulted in death, hospitalization, and COVID-19. Results: For the above mentioned scenarios, all the models estimates different attributes (such as cardiac arrest, Cancer, Hyperlipidemia, Kidney Disease, Diabetes, Atrial Fibrillation, Dementia, Thyroid, etc.) for death, hospitalization, and COVID-19 even after vaccination. Further, for prediction, LGBM outperforms all the other developed models in most of the scenarios whereas, LR, RF, NB, and MLP perform satisfactorily in patches. Conclusion: The male population in the age group of 50C70 has been found most susceptible to this virus. Also, people with existing serious illnesses have been found most vulnerable. Therefore, they must be vaccinated in close observations. Generally, no serious adverse effect of the vaccine has been observed therefore, people must vaccinate themselves without any hesitation at the earliest. Also, the model developed using LGBM establishes its supremacy over all the other prediction models. Therefore, it can be very helpful for the policymakers in administrating and prioritizing the population for the different vaccination programs.","output":"Vaccine hesitancy in the post-vaccination COVID-19 era: a machine learning and statistical analysis driven study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This was an observational, cross-sectional, and multicentre study carried out from October to December 2020, through a survey sent to Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery members in public hospitals with different levels of complexity. Our objective was to complete a national analysis of clinical practice, organisation, infrastructure, the services portfolio, teaching, and research activity related to ultrasound. RESULTS: Data from 104 hospitals were analysed. Ultrasound was used in 56.7% of cases, both in the area of bronchopleural techniques and on conventional wards, with no differences between centres. Lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed more often in the procedures area in intermediate-complexity centres compared to high- and low-complexity centres (36% vs. 31% and 6.25%, respectively). More high-complexity centres had three or more ultrasound scanners than intermediate-complexity centres (38% vs. 16%); 43% of low-complexity centres shared their ultrasound equipment with other specialties. Fewer than 6% of centres did not have an ultrasound machine. LUS was most often used during the treatment of pleural effusion (91.3%), in the differential diagnosis of dyspnoea (51.9%), and to rule out iatrogenic pneumothorax (50.9%). Only 5.7% of the centres had a pulmonologist specialised in LUS. Finally, fewer than 35% of the hospitals were teaching centres and fewer than 18% participated in research projects. CONCLUSIONS: The use and availability of LUS has grown in pulmonology services, however, still relatively few pulmonologists are specialised in its use.

Multiple conventional analgesics were used by 11.9%. Frequent analgesic use was more likely in women (odds ratio (OR) 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.3)) and people with more pain (moderate 1.7 (1.2 to 2.4); severe 3.1 (2.1 to 4.7)); nutraceutical use was less likely in non-whites (0.4 (0.3 to 0.6)), those more than 74-years old (0.6 (0.3 to 0.9)) and those with comorbidities (0.6 (0.5 to 0.9)) and more likely in people with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 4 (2.2 (1.5 to 3.3)). Overall there was no change in the proportion of participants frequently using prescription or over the counter (OTC) analgesics at 36 months, although most people had changed medication type; of those using a traditional analgesic at baseline approximately one third were still using the same type at 36 months (ranging from 26.2% of baseline prescription NSAID users to 40.6% of baseline acetaminophen users).

The degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine was predominantly contributed by chlorination (>60%), direct UV photolysis (>80%) and radical oxidation (>90%), respectively, during the treatment by the UV-LED/chlorine AOP at three tested UV wavelengths (i.e., 265, 285 and 300 nm). The most effective UV wavelengths for the degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine were 265, 285 and 300 nm, respectively. The degradation of all the three micropollutants was enhanced with increasing pH from 6 to 8, though the reasons for the pH dependence were different. The residues of the micropollutants and their degradation (by)products were removed by post-adsorption using granular activated carbon (GAC). Interestingly and more importantly, the adsorption rates of the degradation (by)products were 2-3 times higher than the adsorption rates of the corresponding micropollutants, indicating the formation of more adsorbable (by)products after the AOP pre-treatment. The UV-LED/chlorine AOP followed by GAC adsorption provides a multi-barrier treatment system for enhancing micropollutant removal in potable water. The findings also suggest the merit of the sequential use of UV-LEDs followed by GAC in treating chlorine-containing potable water in small-scale water treatment systems (e.g., point-of-use or point-of-entry water purifiers).","output":"Removal of micropollutants in drinking water using UV-LED/chlorine advanced oxidation process followed by activated carbon adsorption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In vertebrates, bone formation is dynamically controlled by the activity of two specialized cell types: the bone-generating osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts. Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NFB ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.","output":"CD13 is a Critical Regulator of Cell-cell Fusion in Osteoclastogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two 44-d experiments were conducted to evaluate nutritional strategies with different concentrations of dietary lysine (and other amino acids) on growth rate and subsequent compensatory gain of 90-kg finishing pigs. Three diets were formulated to contain 0.70 (control), 0.50% and 0.18% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys. In Exp. 1, 356 pigs (Line 241  600, DNA; initially 89.0  1.10 kg) were used with four treatments. From d 0 to 28, pigs received either the control or the 0.50%-Lys diet.

The empirical results demonstrate that trade openness, tourism arrivals and renewable energy encourage economic growth. Therefore, according to the econometric results, renewable energy allows improving environmental quality. However, CO2 emissions are positively correlated with economic growth, showing that growth is directly correlated by climate change and greenhouse gas. The results also confirm the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) for the panel.

METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study conducted at the University of Indonesia Hospital. The study was conducted in June 2020 with 742 participants (staff members) using secondary data from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results. We presented data in the descriptive form and performed bivariate analysis using the chi-square/Fischer test for categorical data. RESULTS: the PCR test results were positive in 83 (11.1%) participants, with a case-per-tracing ratio of 1:24 and 1:2 in the first and third phases of tracing, respectively. The COVID-19 case graph for the participants decreased along with the implementation of the 3T strategy. The positivity rate in the first phase of tracing was 20% and decreased to 5% in the third phase of tracing. Staff with confirmed positive test results were advised to isolate themselves (hospital or self-isolation). Hospital isolation was found to be associated with the duration of PCR test conversion (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: the 3T strategy is effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively.

Although consensus guidelines have been published to unify Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated challenges, this does not exist for non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal allergies outside of Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome. We therefore set out to establish the use of home introduction protocols (HIP) for confirmation of food allergy for milk, soya, egg and wheat using a ladder approach in children with non-IgE mediated allergy. Materials and Methods: Patients with suspected non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal allergies (0-16 years) were recruited following symptom improvement on an elimination diet. All children had skin prick or specific IgE tests to rule out IgE-mediated allergies prior to suggestion the HIP. Number of trials and outcome was documented. HIPs were developed using a published ladder approach for cow's milk as baseline and final dose was calculated based on guidelines for food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome and portions for age from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. First foods were baked/highly processed and every 4th day patients moved to a more unprocessed/unheated food. Results: From 131 recruited patients, 117 (89.3%) followed the HIP for food allergens. No adverse events were documented. In more than 50% of cases one attempt at the HIP was sufficient to establish allergy status, but many required 2-5 attempts before the outcome was clear. About half of the children were fully tolerant to foods they initially eliminated: 36, 26 and 30% were partially tolerant to milk, soya, and egg and only 15% achieved partial tolerance to wheat. Wheat was the allergen introduced earliest, followed by soya, cow's milk and egg. Conclusions: This study indicates that home HIPs are safe in non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food allergy and that the ladder approach may be useful in re-introducing allergens in children at home with non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal allergies. From this study we can also conclude that tolerance to processed/baked allergens was observed in many children.

However, accurate screening of COVID-19 is still a massive challenge due to the spatial complexity of 3D volumes, the labeling difficulty of infection areas, and the slight discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in chest CT. While a few pioneering works have made significant progress, they are either demanding manual annotations of infection areas or lack of interpretability. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving highly accurate and interpretable screening of COVID-19 from chest CT with weak labels. We propose an attention-based deep 3D multiple instance learning (AD3D-MIL) where a patient-level label is assigned to a 3D chest CT that is viewed as a bag of instances. AD3D-MIL can semantically generate deep 3D instances following the possible infection area. AD3D-MIL further applies an attention-based pooling approach to 3D instances to provide insight into each instance's contribution to the bag label. AD3D-MIL finally learns Bernoulli distributions of the bag-level labels for more accessible learning. We collected 460 chest CT examples: 230 CT examples from 79 patients with COVID-19, 100 CT examples from 100 patients with common pneumonia, and 130 CT examples from 130 people without pneumonia.

Information on back pain was assessed using questions about episodes of back pain and worsening symptoms during the quarantine. The pattern of movement behaviors adopted before and during the pandemic were considered for physical inactivity (<150 min/week of activity), high TV-viewing (4h/d), and high computer/tablet use (4h/d). Covariates included sex, age group, academic achievement, skin color, working status during the quarantine, and adherence to the quarantine. Logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses (weighted for national representativity). Results: Becoming inactive (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.37), with high TV-viewing (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.61) and high computer/tablet use (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.73) during the pandemic were associated with a higher incidence of back pain. The incidence of physical inactivity was also associated with increased back pain (OR=2.71, 95%CI: 1.64, 4.48). Conclusions: We conclude that increased physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine are associated with the incidence and worsening symptoms of back pain among Brazilian adults.","output":"Changes in movement behaviors and back pain during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critical illness in COVID-19 is caused by inflammatory lung injury, mediated by the host immune system. We and others have shown that host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care1 or hospitalisation2;3;4 following SARS-Co-V2 infection. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study is designed to compare genetic variants in critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing and statistical fine mapping in 7,491 critically-ill cases compared with 48,400 population controls to discover and replicate 22 independent variants that significantly predispose to life-threatening COVID-19. We identify 15 new independent associations with critical COVID-19, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB, PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A), and blood type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating expression of multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in critical disease. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for genetic association analysis and enables detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.

We evaluate the potential of targeting CD38 to ameliorate NAD-related metabolic imbalance and tissue dysfunction in the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RECENT FINDINGS In this review, we will discuss emerging basic, preclinical, and human data that point to the novel role of CD38 in dysregulated NAD-homeostasis in SSc, SLE, and RA. In particular, recent studies implicate increased activity of CD38, one of the main enzymes in NAD catabolism, in the pathogenesis of persistent systemic fibrosis in SSc, and increased susceptibility of SLE patients to infections. We will also discuss recent studies that demonstrate that a cytotoxic CD38 antibody can promote clearance of plasma cells involved in the generation of RA antibodies. SUMMARY Recent studies identify potential therapeutic approaches for boosting NAD to treat rheumatologic diseases including SSc, RA, and SLE, with particular attention to inhibition of CD38 enzymatic activity as a target. Key future directions in the field include the determination of the cell-type specificity and role of CD38 enzymatic activity versus CD38 structural roles in human diseases, as well as the indicators and potential side effects of CD38-targeted treatments.","output":"The NADase enzyme CD38: an emerging pharmacological target for systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus associated with high mortality rates. The use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been recognised as a management option for severe COVID-19 (NHS, Specialty guides for patient management during the coronavirus pandemic Guidance for the role and use of non-invasive respiratory support in adult patients with coronavirus (confirmed or suspected), https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng159). We offered ward-based CPAP to COVID-19, dialysis patients not suitable for escalation to ICU. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of CPAP for COVID-19 dialysis patients compared to non-dialysis COVID-19 patients outside of the intensive care setting. We further aimed to investigate factors associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: Data was collected from a single centre (Royal Preston Hospital, UK), from March to June 2020. Treatment outcomes were compared for dialysis and non-dialysis dependent patients who received CPAP with limitations on their escalation and resuscitation status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were used to compare outcomes. The primary study outcome was 30 day mortality. Confounders including length of admission, systemic anticoagulation and ultrafiltration volumes on dialysis were also analysed. RESULTS: Over the study period, 40 dialysis patients tested positive for COVID-19, with 30 requiring hospital admission. 93% (n = 28) required supplementary oxygen and 12% (n = 9) required CPAP on the ward. These patients were compared to a serial selection of 14 non-dialysis patients treated with CPAP during the same period. Results showed a significant difference in 30 day survival rates between the two groups: 88.9% in the dialysis group vs. 21.4% in the non-dialysis group. Statistical modelling showed that anticoagulation was also an important factor and correlated with better outcomes. CONCLUSION: This is to the best of our knowledge, the largest series of COVID-19 dialysis patients treated with CPAP in a ward-based setting. In general, dialysis dependent patients have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus making them vulnerable to COVID-19 and not always suitable for treatment in ICU. We showed a significantly lower 30 day mortality rate with the use of CPAP in the dialysis group (11.1%) compared to the non-dialysis group (78.6%). Despite a small sample size, we believe this study provides impetus for further work clarifying the role of CPAP in treating COVID-19 dialysis dependent patients.

Though generally assumed to be selective for cellular transcripts, the extent to which SOX impacts viral mRNA stability has remained unknown. We addressed this issue using the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 and, unexpectedly, found that all stages of viral gene expression are controlled through mRNA degradation. Using both comprehensive RNA expression profiling and half-life studies we reveal that the levels of the majority of viral mRNAs but not noncoding RNAs are tempered by MHV68 SOX (muSOX) activity. The targeting of viral mRNA by muSOX is functionally significant, as it impacts intracellular viral protein abundance and progeny virion composition. In the absence of muSOX-imposed gene expression control the viral particles display increased cell surface binding and entry as well as enhanced immediate early gene expression. These phenotypes culminate in a viral replication defect in multiple cell types as well as in vivo, highlighting the importance of maintaining the appropriate balance of viral RNA during gammaherpesviral infection. This is the first example of a virus that fails to broadly discriminate between cellular and viral transcripts during host shutoff and instead uses the targeting of viral messages to fine-tune overall gene expression.","output":"Gammaherpesviral Gene Expression and Virion Composition Are Broadly Controlled by Accelerated mRNA Degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic driven by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has compelled health services globally to direct all available human and economic resources toward fighting the novel coronavirus [...]","output":"Editorial for the Special Issue: 'Current and Novel Antimicrobial Strategies for Bacterial and Fungal Infections by Resistant Organisms'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the first time, organophosphate ester (OPE) content was studied in different types of surgical, self-filtering (KN95, FFP2, and FFP3) and reusable face masks used for COVID-19 prevention.

However, given the wide range of OPEs observed in different masks, it can be concluded that some masks (e.g. reusable) are less OPE-contaminated than others (e.g. KN95). With regard to environmental pollution, the disposal of billions of face masks is adding to the already substantial levels of microplastics and associated toxic additives worldwide, an impact that is lessened by use of reusable masks, which also have the lowest economic cost per user.

With those methods, investigation on patients and their close contacts at hospital wards, families, communities and institutions of the patients were carried out. RESULTS From April 13 through May 8, 2003, there were 175 SARS cases including imported ones, were identified with an incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100,000. Among them, 14 died with a fatality of 8.0%. The whole process of epidemic in Tianjin was less than one month with the following features: (1) 93.7% of the total SARS cases in Tianjin were directly or indirectly transmitted by a super-spreader. (2) 68.6% of the total SARS patients were concentrated in 3 hospitals A, B and C which was menifastated in 'clustering'. Through study on the rest of the SARS patients, results showed that 16.8% of them were transmitted through family close contact and 2.3% due to contact to colleagues. However, 12.6% of the patients were not able to show evidence that they had any contact to a diagnosed SARS patient. At the early stage of the epidemic, a number of medical practitioners were infected, taking up 38.2% of the total SARS cases. Among the total number of 1 975 medical workers who participated in the SARS medical cares and treatments, 3.4% of them got infected. During the outbreak, all index cases and chains of transmission seemed to be clear, with only 3 patients not able to be traced for the source of infection, taking up 2% of the total SARS patients in Tianjin. Among the 10 index cases, only the super spreader and another one index case transmitted the virus to their contacts but the rest of index cases did not cause any secondary infection.

Here we describe a series of artificial life simulations that reveal a close relationship between the evolution of cellularity, the evolution of metabolism, and the richness of the environment. When environments are rich in processing energy, a resource that the digital organisms require to both process their genomes and replicate, populations evolve toward a state of non-cellularity. But when processing energy is not readily available in the environment and organisms must produce their own processing energy from food puzzles, populations always evolve both a proficient metabolism and a high level of cellular impermeability. Even between these two environmental extremes, the population-averaged values of cellular impermeability and metabolic proficiency exhibit a very strong correlation with one another. Further investigations show that non-cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is abundant because it allows organisms to access the available energy, while cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is scarce because it affords organisms the genetic fidelity required to incrementally evolve efficient metabolisms. The selection pressures favoring either non-cellularity or cellularity can be reversed when the environment transitions from one of abundant processing energy to one of scarce processing energy.

It was noted early on that although these masks protect clinicians, they may represent a risk to the patient due to unfiltered air being directed towards them during close contact(1) and the National Health Service circulated guidance to that effect(2). Subsequently, an increased incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was noticed, postulated to be due to contamination of the surgical field by microbial particles from valved masks or hoods leading to a National Patient Safety Alert(3).

The conversion to electric vehicles (EVs) represents a major path to decarbonize the transport sector, with potentially significant co-benefits for human health. However, the scale of such co-benefits largely remains an empirical question and lacks observational evidence. The full lockdown in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provides an unprecedented real-world experiment to evaluate emission reduction potentials of a large-scale transition to EVs. Here, we utilize ground and satellite observations of air quality during the full lockdown to constrain predictions of a comprehensive chemical transport model and find that the substantial traffic reductions are near-linearly linked to reductions of PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m) and NO2. A further extrapolation of a full conversion to EVs shows a significant reduction of PM2.5 (30%C70%) and NO2 (30%C80%) in most of China. Our findings provide fact-based evidence of potential environmental benefits generated by fully switching to EVs.","output":"Switching to electric vehicles can lead to significant reductions of PM2.5 and NO2 across China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The capability of generalization to unseen domains is crucial for deep learning models when considering real-world scenarios. However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","output":"Domain adaptation based self-correction model for COVID-19 infection segmentation in CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhythm disturbances are life-threatening cardiovascular diseases, accounting for many deaths annually worldwide. Abnormal electrical activity might arise in a structurally normal heart in response to specific triggers or as a consequence of cardiac tissue alterations, in both cases with catastrophic consequences on heart global functioning.

While numbers of new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls are rising at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and the measures taken to counteract it could cause an increase in distress among the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence on the calls made to Samaritans Ireland, a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41,648, callers=3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the government of the Republic of Ireland (calls=46,043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences between the duration of calls in the two periods at a global level and at an hourly level. We performed k-means clustering to determine the types of callers who used the helpline based on their helpline call usage behavior and to assess the impact of the pandemic on the caller type usage patterns. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources.

In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence.

The potent invasion and migration of HCC mainly impact the prognosis and recurrence of the disease. Our previous study found that miR-99b was highly expressed in HCC, and its expression was associated with vascular invasion. It was speculated that miR-99b may play a role in HCC invasion and migration, while the specific mechanism remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS qRT-PCR was applied to detect expressions of miR-99b and KAI1 genes in L02, HepG2, and MHCC97H cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-99b inhibitor, miR-99b mimic, and NC. Flow cytometry was used to test cell cycle and apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was adopted to validate the target gene of miR-99b. Wound healing assay was used to detect cell migration. Transwell assay was performed to detect cell invasion. Western blot was performed to detect KAI1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expressions. Immunofluorescence assay was adopted to test Vimentin expression. RESULTS The level of miR-99b was reduced in L02 while up-regulated in MHCC97H. By contrast, the expression of KAI1 was increased in L02 but declined in MHCC97H. The transfection of miR-99b mimic inhibited HepG2 apoptosis and accelerated cell cycle. MiR-99b suppressed KAI gene expression through targeting its 3'-UTR. MiR-99b mimic or si-KAI1 transfection promoted cell invasion and migration, while their simultaneous action significantly enhanced cell invasion and migration. The overexpression of miR-99b or knockdown of KAI1 significantly weakened HepG2 cell adhesion, reduced E-cadherin expression, upregulated N-cadherin and Vimentin, and promoted cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

The aim of our work was the study of immunohistochemical surfactant expression in the lungs of patients died following SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, in order to shed light on a possible therapeutic surfactant administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated four patients who died due to ARDS following SARS-COV-2 infection and four patients submitted to lung biopsy, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In all 8 cases, lung specimens were immunostained with anti-surfactant protein A (SP-A) and B (SP-B). RESULTS: In control subjects, reactivity for SP-B was restricted to type II alveolar cells. Immunostaining for SP-A was observed on the surface of alveolar spaces. In the COVID-19 positive lungs, immunoreactivity for SP-B was similar to that observed in control lungs; SP-A was strongly expressed along the alveolar wall. Moreover, dense aggregates of SP-A positive material were observed in the alveolar spaces. CONCLUSIONS: Our immunohistochemical data show the dysregulation of surfactant production in COVID-19 patients, particularly regarding SP-A expression.

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral-host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3' end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.","output":"Reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome of cultured human cells and can be expressed in patient-derived tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the onset of COVID-19, major subsections of our global society have shifted and mutated from the status quo of operation, especially in the field of education.

The drug resistance and prevalence of sul3 E. coli were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification, multi-site sequence typing (MLST), drug sensitivity test, and drug resistance gene detection, and then the plasmid containing sul3 was conjugated with the recipient strain (C600). The effect of sul3 plasmid on the recipient was analyzed by stability, drug resistance, and competitive test. In this study, forty-six sul3 positive E. coli strains were separated. A total of 12 ST types were observed, and 1 of those was a previously unknown type. The ST350 is the most numerous type. All isolates were multidrug-resistant E. coli, with high resistant rates to penicillin, ceftriaxone sodium, streptomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and chloramphenicol (100%, 73.9%, 82.6%, 100%, 80.4%, 71.7%, and 97.8%, respectively).

These plasmids had no effect on the growth of the recipient bacteria but greatly reduced the competitiveness of the strain at least 60 times in vitro. In Nanning, these sul3-positive E. coli had such strong AMR, and the plasmid carrying sul3 had the ability to transfer multiple resistance genes that long-term monitoring was necessary.

On the epistemic view, he claims there is a principle concerning expert disagreement underlying precautionary-based reasoning called the ecumenical principle: all expert views should be considered in a precautionary appraisal, not just those that are the most prominent or influential. In articulating the doxastic commitments of decision-makers under this constraint, Peterson precludes any probabilistic rule that might result in combining expert opinions. For combined or consensus probabilities are likely to provide decision-makers with information that is more precise than warranted.

Its main applications in medicine are related to mapping the collagen architecture of in-vivo, ex-vivo and fixed tissues based on endogenous contrast. In this work we present how H&E staining of excised and fixed tissues influences the extraction and use of image parameters specific to polarization-resolved SHG (PSHG) microscopy, which are known to provide quantitative information on the collagen structure and organization. We employ a theoretical collagen model for fitting the experimental PSHG datasets to obtain the second order susceptibility tensor elements ratios and the fitting efficiency. Furthermore, the second harmonic intensity acquired under circular polarization is investigated. The evolution of these parameters in both forward- and backward-collected SHG are computed for both H&E-stained and unstained tissue sections. Consistent modifications are observed between the two cases in terms of the fitting efficiency and the second harmonic intensity. This suggests that similar quantitative analysis workflows applied to PSHG images collected on stained and unstained tissues could yield different results, and hence affect the diagnostic accuracy.","output":"Influence of hematoxylin and eosin staining on the quantitative analysis of second harmonic generation imaging of fixed tissue sections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, carriers of active ingredients in the form of particles of a size measured in nanometers are the focus of interest of research centers worldwide.

However, this phenomenon is inadequately researched. This study examines fake news sharing with the lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory, uses and gratification theory (UGT) and big five personality traits (BFPT) theory to understand the motivations for sharing fake news and the personality traits that do so. The stimuli in the model comprise gratifications (pass time, entertainment, socialization, information sharing and information seeking) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness and neuroticism). The feeling of authenticating or instantly sharing news is the organism leading to sharing fake news, which forms the response in the study. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model was tested by the data collected from a sample of 221 social media users in India. The data were analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling to determine the effects of UGT and personality traits on fake news sharing. The moderating role of the platform WhatsApp or Facebook was studied. Findings: The results suggest that pass time, information sharing and socialization gratifications lead to instant sharing news on social media platforms. Individuals who exhibit extraversion, neuroticism and openness share news on social media platforms instantly. In contrast, agreeableness and conscientiousness personality traits lead to authentication news before sharing on the social media platform. Originality/value: This study contributes to social media literature by identifying the user gratifications and personality traits that lead to sharing fake news on social media platforms. Furthermore, the study also sheds light on the moderating influence of the choice of the social media platform for fake news sharing. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Fake or real news?

In the present study, a computational network-biology approach has been used for comparing three candidate drugs i.e. quercetin, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) to be effectively repurposed against COVID-19. For this, the associations between these drugs and genes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) diseases were retrieved and a directed drug-gene-gene-disease interaction network was constructed. Further, to quantify the associations between a target gene and a disease gene, the shortest paths from the target gene to the disease genes were identified. A vector DV was calculated to represent the extent to which a disease gene was influenced by these drugs. Quercetin was quantified as the best among the three drugs, suited for repurposing with DV of -70.19, followed by NAC with DV of -39.99 and 2-DG with DV of -13.71.

As the risk factors of lab accidents can be conceptualized as occurring at multiple levels, systematically improving and optimizing lab safety is the crucial route to accident prevention in labs. In this paper, a novel method that integrates a structural equation model (SEM) and system dynamics (SD) is presented to dynamically assess lab safety with the characteristics of insufficient data and uncertainty. On the basis of a questionnaire investigation, the SEM was utilized to determine the influencing factors on lab safety and acquire the path coefficients among these factors, which were embedded into the SD model as the weight of the influencing factors. An illustration was carried out to test and validate the proposed method, and a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to recognize variables contributing the most to the improvement of lab safety. The results demonstrated that the safety input of human and management subsystems is the most effective to improve the lab safety; meanwhile, safety awareness, emergency ability, operation skills, safety culture and safety training are the top five contributing factors, which can promote lab safety in the shortest time.","output":"A Methodology for Dynamic Assessment of Laboratory Safety by SEM-SD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study empirically investigates what kinds of countries imported and exported medical products during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. SETTING: Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on prenatal care in the United States: Qualitative analysis from a survey of 2519 pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The association of cough with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHP) DNA detection in specimens was evaluated under conditions in which the MHP status of inoculated and contact-infected pen mates was closely monitored for 59 days post-inoculation (DPI). METHODS Seven-week-old pigs (n = 39) were allocated to five rooms (with one pen). Rooms contained 9 pigs each, with 1, 3, 6, or 9 MHP-inoculated pigs, respectively, except Room 5 (three sham-inoculated pigs). Cough data (2  week) and specimens, tracheal swabs (2  week), oral fluids (daily), drinker wipes (~ 1  week), and air samples (3  week) were collected. At 59 DPI, pigs were euthanized, and lung and trachea were evaluated for gross and microscopic lesions. Predictive cough value to MHP DNA detection in drinker and oral fluid samples were estimated using mixed logistic regression. RESULTS Following inoculation, MHP DNA was first detected in tracheal swabs from inoculated pigs (DPI 3), then oral fluids (DPI 8), air samples (DPI 10), and drinker wipes (21 DPI). MHP DNA was detected in oral fluids in 17 of 59 (Room 1) to 43 of 59 (Room 3) samples, drinker wipes in 4 of 8 (Rooms 2 and 3) to 5 of 8 (Rooms 1 and 4) samples, and air samples in 5 of 26 (Room 2) or 3 of 26 (Room 4) samples. Logistic regression showed that the frequency of coughing pigs in a pen was associated with the probability of MHP DNA detection in oral fluids (P < 0.01) and nearly associated with drinker wipes (P = 0.08). Pathology data revealed an association between the period when infection was first detected and the severity of gross lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS Dry, non-productive coughs suggest the presence of MHP, but laboratory testing and MHP DNA detection is required for confirmation. Based on the data from this study, oral fluids and drinker wipes may provide a convenient alternative for MHP DNA detection at the pen level when cough is present. This information may help practitioners in specimen selection for MHP surveillance.","output":"Cough associated with the detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae DNA in clinical and environmental specimens under controlled conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In contrast to the relatively ubiquitous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), expression of the mammalian ACE homologue, ACE2, was initially described in the heart, kidney and testis.

Here ACE2 is poised to metabolise circulating peptides which may include angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and the product of angiotensin I cleavage by ACE. To this end, ACE2 may counterbalance the effects of ACE within the reninCangiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, ACE2 has been implicated in the regulation of heart and renal function where it is proposed to control the levels of angiotensin II relative to its hypotensive metabolite, angiotensin-(1C7). The recent solution of the structure of ACE2, and ACE, has provided new insight into the substrate and inhibitor profiles of these two key regulators of the RAS.

We next examined whether acetate treatment is beneficial in a mouse model of RSV infection using clinical isolates. We sought to investigate the relationship of gut microbiota and fecal acetate with disease severity among infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, and whether treating their respiratory epithelial cells with acetate ex-vivo impacts upon viral load and ISG expression. We further treated epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with acetate.Findings: In vitro pre-treatment of A549 cells with acetate reduced RSV load after infection with clinical isolates and increased the expression of RIG-I and ISG15. Animals treated with acetate intranasally recovered significantly faster, with reduction in the RSV clinical isolates viral load, and increased lung expression of IFNB1 and the RIG-I receptor. Experiments in RIG-I knockout A549 cells demonstrated that the protection relies on RIG-I presence. Gut microbial profile was associated with bronchiolitis severity and with acetate in stool. Increased acetate levels were associated with increasing oxygen saturation at admission, and shorter duration of fever. Ex-vivo treatment of patients respiratory cells with acetate reduced RSV load and increased expression of ISGs OAS1 and ISG15, and virus recognition receptors MAVS and RIG-I, but not IFNB1.

Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental 1 (BoNT + KinesioTaping), experimental 2 (BoNT + ShamTaping) or control (BoNT) treatment. After 12 weeks they were moved to the next experimental group and finally every patient received all 3 proposed treatment options. The severity of CD was quantified with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) including Torticollis severity, Disability, and Pain scales. Quality of life was evaluated using Craniocervical dystonia questionnaire (CDQ4). RESULTS: In all treatment groups, there was a significant improvement in dystonia symptoms measured with TWSTRS (total score) after BoNT injection regardless of the allocation to the experimental treatment (p < .05). ANOVA analysis revealed no differences in any of the TWSTRS variables after the intervention. Quality of life was significantly improved after application of taping (p < .05, p = .03).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in the departments of internal medicine of the Klinikum Saarbrcken, a tertiary care hospital, between March 15 and December 31, 2020. A telephone interview with survivors was conducted at least 12 months after discharge. The interview was initiated with an open-ended question whether the patient had fully recovered from the disease. In the event of a subjective incomplete recovery, the patient was prompted to report any continuous or frequent symptoms that had not occurred prior to COVID-19. Finally, independent of the open-ended question response, all patients were asked closed questions which addressed new symptom onset of persistent fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, headache, muscle and joint pain following COVID-19. RESULTS: In all, 235 survivors were contacted and 162 could be included in the analysis. In 55 of 162 interviews (34.0%) at least one persistent COVID-19 symptom (PCS) was spontaneously reported. Four of 55 survivors with PCS reported five additional symptoms on the closed questions. One survivor, who responded positively to the open-ended question, reported new onset PCS in response to the closed questions. Physical fatigue (24.7%), cognitive dysfunction (14.8%), shortness of breath (8.6%), muscle and joint pain (6.8%) and headache (6.2%) were the most frequently reported PCS.

CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old Asian woman visited the emergency care department during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Northern Italy. About 6 months before, she had noted the onset of right breast swelling accompanied by skin redness and itching. She never consulted a physician, and, over time, the local skin condition progressed to a large scaly plaque covering the entire breast surface including the nipple. At presentation, abduction of the right upper limb was impaired due to severe shoulder pain. CT scan showed the presence of bilateral breast masses with necrotic and colliquative features, and multiple skeletal, nodal, pulmonary, and brain images suggestive of metastases. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the contralateral breast showed grade 2 non-special type infiltrating carcinoma. The patient was referred to the breast oncology unit and is currently being treated with aromatase inhibitors and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the entire spectrum of oncological care including breast cancer.

We estimated the economic costs of universal access to basic hand hygiene services in household settings in 46 LDCs. Methods: Our model combines quantities of households with no handwashing facility (HWF) and prices of promotion campaigns, HWFs, soap, and water. For quantities, we used estimates from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. For prices, we collated data from recent impact evaluations and electronic searches. Accounting for inflation and purchasing power, we calculated costs over 2021-2030, and estimated total cost probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: An estimated US$ 12.2 - 15.3 billion over 10 years is needed for universal hand hygiene in household settings in 46 LDCs. The average annual cost of hand hygiene promotion is $334 million (24% of annual total), with a further $233 million for \\"top-up\\" promotion (17%). Together, these promotion costs represent $0.47 annually per head of LDC population. The annual cost of HWFs, a purpose-built drum with tap and stand, is $174 million (13%). The annual cost of soap is $497 million (36%), and water $127 million (9%). Conclusion: The annual cost of behaviour change promotion to those with no handwashing facility represents 4.7% of median government health expenditure in LDCs, and 1% of their annual aid receipts. These costs could be covered by mobilising resources from across government and partners, and could be reduced by harnessing economies of scale and integrating hand hygiene with other behaviour change campaigns where appropriate.

Past life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies overlooked upstream emission heterogeneity by assuming that a decline in oil demand will displace average crude oil2. We explore the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions impacts of marginal crude sources, identifying the upstream carbon intensity (CI) of the producers most sensitive to an oil demand decline (for example, due to a shift to alternative vehicles). We link econometric models of production profitability of 1,933 oilfields (~90% of the 2015 world supply) with their production CI. Then, we examine their response to a decline in demand under three oil market structures. According to our estimates, small demand shocks have different upstream CI implications than large shocks. Irrespective of the market structure, small shocks (-2.5% demand) displace mostly heavy crudes with ~25-54% higher CI than that of the global average. However, this imbalance diminishes as the shocks become bigger and if producers with market power coordinate their response to a demand decline.

Objective: This study assesses the impact of bias on COVID-19 topics, and demonstrates an automatic algorithm for reducing bias when applied to COVID-19 social media texts. This could help public health informatics studies produce more timely results during crises, with a reduced risk of misleading results. Methods: Emotion and sentiment classifiers were applied to COVID-19 data before and after debiasing the classifiers using unsupervised contrastive clustering. Contrastive clustering approximates the degree to which tokens exhibit a causal versus correlational relationship with emotion or sentiment, by contrasting the tokens' relative salience to topics versus emotions or sentiments. Results: Contrastive clustering distinguishes correlation from causation for tokens with an F1 score of 0.753. Masking bias prone tokens from the classifier input decreases the classifier's overall F1 score by 0.02 (anger) and 0.033 (negative sentiment), but improves the F1 score for sentences annotated as bias prone by 0.155 (anger) and 0.103 (negative sentiment).

This report describes the first case of a patient with severe COVID-19 at our institution during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to June 2020) who returned to work following rehabilitation management. CASE: A 48-year-old female nurse was admitted with COVID-19 and underwent mechanical ventilation (MV). Respiratory and anti-gravity training was conducted as physical therapy; however, the patient developed PICS, muscle weakness, delirium, and psychological problems. After the withdrawal of MV, muscle strengthening activities, activities of daily living (ADL) training, family visits, and occupational and speech therapy were started. On day 60 post-admission, the patient was able to perform ADL independently and was discharged; however, she continued to experience shortness of breath during exertion. Post-discharge, follow-up assessments for symptoms, respiratory function, and exercise capacity were continued. On day 130, she returned to work as a nurse. DISCUSSION: The PICS noted during hospitalization in this patient improved, but at discharge, the patient had difficulty completing the practical tasks involved in a nurses workload. Follow-up assessments of symptoms, respiratory function, and exercise capacity after discharge helped to determine whether the patient could return to work.","output":"COVID-19 Patient Returned to Work after Long Hospitalization and Follow-up: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La pandmie de COVID 19 bouleverse le monde depuis plus dun an.

METHODS: This survey study was conducted at urology clinic of Ankara City Hospital between March 1 and June 1, 2020, and included 24 male patients who agreed to answer the questionnaires (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] I and II and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Demographical and clinical data (age, time since diagnosis, total serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, risk groups according to the D'Amico classification system, smoking, alcohol habitus, major surgical history and comorbidities) of the patients were collected from hospital software. RESULTS: The mean STAI-I score of the patients (46.7  1.4 [44-49]) was significantly higher than their STAI-II score (41.7  2.4 [39-47]) (P < .001). The negative correlation between the decrease in age and STAI-I score was found to be statistically significant (r = 0.439, P < .05). The mean BDI score of the patients was 4.3  3.2 (0-13), which was compatible with mild depression. There was no statistically significant difference among the time elapsed from diagnosis, PSA levels, smoking and alcohol habitus, major surgical history and comorbidity status and STAI-I, STAI-II and BDI scores (P > .05).

The antibacterial activity of MgO NPs against Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC 25922) was significantly improved as shown by the bactericidal efficacy test results. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, Fe was successfully doped into MgO lattice and mainly adopted interstitial doping. The Fe-doping led to increased oxygen vacancies and O(A) content (from 13.5% to 41.3%) on MgO surface, which may have facilitated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and bacteria death. The wrinkled and sunken E. coli surface after contact with Fe-doped MgO NPs also confirmed the existence of adsorption damage mechanism.

It is well\\\\known that these agents can prolong the QTc interval and potentially induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP). We aim to assess the prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmic events in COVID\\\\19 patients treated with these drugs. METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies reporting peak QTc 500 ms, peak QTc change 60 ms, peak QTc interval, peak change of QTc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, or atrioventricular block (AVB). All meta\\\\analyses were conducted using a random\\\\effects model. RESULTS: Forty\\\\seven studies (three case series, 35 cohorts, and nine randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) involving 13 087 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of peak QTc 500 ms was 9% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3%C18%) and 8% (95%CI, 3%C14%) in patients who received hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, respectively. Likewise, the use of hydroxychloroquine (risk ratio [RR], 2.68; 95%CI, 1.56C4.60) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (RR, 3.28; 95%CI, 1.16C9.30) was associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation compared to no treatment. Ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, and AVB were reported in <1% of patients across treatment groups. The only two studies that reported individual data of lopinavir/ritonavir found no cases of QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID\\\\19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine with or without azithromycin had a relatively high prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation. However, the prevalence of arrhythmic events was very low, probably due to underreporting.

We performed the first study in northern Peru to describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in febrile patients with a suspected diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya fever. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive cross-sectional study was performed in febrile patients attending primary healthcare centers from April 2020 through March 2021. Patients enrolled underwent serum sample collection for the molecular and serological detection of DENV and CHIKV. Also, serological detection of IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was performed. RESULTS: 464 patients were included during the study period, of which (40.51%) were positive for one pathogen, meanwhile (6.90%) presented co-infections between 2 or more pathogens. The majority of patients with monoinfections were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM with (73.40%), followed by DENV 18.09% and CHIKV (8.51%). The most frequent co-infection was DENV + SARS-CoV-2 with (65.63%), followed by DENV + CHIKV and DENV + CHIKV + SARS-CoV-2, both with (12.50%). The presence of polyarthralgias in hands (43.75%, p<0.01) and feet (31.25%, p = 0.05) were more frequently reported in patients with CHIKV monoinfection. Also, conjunctivitis was more common in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM (11.45%, p<0.01). The rest of the symptoms were similar among all the study groups. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were frequently detected in acute sera from febrile patients with a clinical suspicion of arboviral disease. The presence of polyarthralgias in hands and feet may be suggestive of CHIKV infection. These results reaffirm the need to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a main differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness in arboviruses endemic areas, as well as to consider co-infections between these pathogens.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in febrile patients from an endemic region of dengue and chikungunya in Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitals and intensive care units are straining to provide care for a large surge of patients with coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) Contingency plans are being made for the possibility that resources for lifesaving care, including mechanical ventilators, will be in short supply Covid-19 is more severe and more likely to be fatal in older persons Dementia is one of the commonest severe comorbidities of aging Persons with dementia are vulnerable and often need the support of others to make their voices heard This commentary, created by a task force commissioned by the Alzheimer Society of Canada, provides guidance for triaging persons with dementia to scarce medical resources during the Covid-19 pandemic","output":"Pandemic Dementia Scarce Resource Allocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial and ethnic disparities in the severity of COVID\\\\19 in pregnant women in the United States reflect the health consequences of the structural effects of racism.","output":"Racial and ethnic disparities in severity of COVID\\\\19 disease in pregnancy in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adequate information and knowledge about COVID-19 has been shown to induce the confidence and positive performance among healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, assessing the relationship between confidence in knowledge and associated factors among HCWs is vital in the fight against COVID-19. This paper investigates factors associated with HCWs' confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19 in South Africa in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods: Data utilized in this paper were from an online survey conducted among HCWs using a structured questionnaire on a data free online platform. The study population were all the medical fraternity in South Africa including medical and nurse practitioners as well as other healthcare professionals. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to examine the factors associated with confidence in HCWs' overall knowledge about COVID-19. Results: Overall, just below half (47.4%) of respondents indicated that they had confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19. Increased odds of having confidence in the knowledge about COVID-19 were significantly associated with being male [aOR = 1.31 95% CI (1.03-1.65), p < 0.05], having a doctorate degree [aOR = 2.01 (1.23-3.28), p < 0.05], being satisfied with the information about COVID-19 guidelines [aOR = 6.01 (4.89-7.39), p < 0.001], having received training in 6-8 areas [aOR = 2.54 (1.89-3.43), p < 0.001] and having received training in 9-11 areas [aOR = 5.33 (3.81-7.47), p < 0.001], and having already treated COVID-19 patients [aOR = 1.43 (1.08-1.90), p < 0.001].

A typical feature of COVID-19 is the suppression of type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses type I and III IFN induction stimulated by SeV infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1, thus preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 and subsequently impeding the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Consequently, ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and illuminates the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) membrane (M) protein inhibits type I and III interferon production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this work was to perform a temporal quantitative analysis, using the scientometric technique, considering the number of citations that the terms Primary Production of Aquatic Macrophytesand Energetic Ecology received in a 50-year period (1956 to 2006).

In addition, a convenience sample of sera from injured raccoons was also tested, and clinical serological data from the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory were examined. The proportion of dogs with an antibody titre (>or=1:100) to any serovar was 27/158 (17.1%, 95% CI 11.6-23.9), and that proportion among raccoons was 22/115 (19.1%, 95% CI 12.4-27.5) suggesting that the potential for exposure in Washington state is not uncommon.

Drawing from the cognitive activation theory of stress, we investigated the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of the influence of COVID-19-related disruptions on daily mHealth emergency use. METHODS: To test the proposed model, this study adopts the experience sampling method to collect daily data. The experience sampling method helps researchers to capture participants' fluctuations in emotions, mental engagement in an activity, and experienced stress. This study collected 550 cases nested in 110 samples in mainland China to test the conceptual model. In addition, we employed hierarchical linear modeling analysis to test the effect of COVID-19-related disruptions on mHealth emergency use. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19-related disruptions increased COVID-19-induced strain (?3=0.24, P<.001) and mHealth emergency use on a daily basis (?3=0.28, P<.001). COVID-19-induced daily strain mediated this relationship (effect=0.09, 95% CI 0.05-0.14). Promotion regulatory focus moderated the relationship between COVID-19-induced strain and mHealth emergency use (?3=0.35, P=.02). In addition, the indirect relationship between disruptions and mHealth emergency use intentions through COVID-19-induced strain is contingent upon promotion regulatory focus: this relationship was stronger in those with high promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.19) than in those with low promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Event disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic induced mHealth emergency use intention through increased psychological strain. Furthermore, individuals' promotion regulatory focus amplified this indirect relationship. Our findings extend our understanding of the factors underlying mHealth emergency use intention and illustrate the potential contingent role of promotion regulatory focus in the cognitive activation theory of stress. This study also opens avenues for future research on mHealth emergency use intention in other countries and cultural settings.","output":"COVID-19-Related Disruptions and Increased mHealth Emergency Use Intention: Experience Sampling Method Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing body of research suggests that neuropsychiatric disorders are closely associated with a background state of chronic, low-grade inflammation. This insight highlights that these disorders are not just localized to dysfunction within the brain, but also have a systemic aspect, which accounts for the frequent comorbid presentation of chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. It is possible that a treatment resistant subgroup of neuropsychiatric patients may benefit from treatment regimens that target their associated proinflammatory state. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) and exercise (i.e. structured PA) are known to influence mental health. In turn, mental disorders may limit health-seeking behaviors - a proposed \\"bidirectional relationship\\" that perpetuates psychopathology. PA is renowned for its positive physical, physiological and mental health benefits. Evidence now points to inflammatory pathways as a potential mechanism for PA in improving mental illness. Relevant pathways include modulation of immune-neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, the production of tissue-derived immunological factors that alter the inflammatory milieu and neurotrophins that are critical mediators of neuroplasticity. In this paper, we will focus on the role of PA in positively improving mental health through potential modulation of chronic inflammation, which is often found in individuals with mental disorders. In a related paper by Edirappuli and colleagues (2020), we will focus on the role of nutrition (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health. Thus, inflammation appears to be a central process underlying mental illness, which may be mitigated by lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle factors are advantageous as first-line interventions due to their cost efficacy, low side-effect profile, and both preventative and therapeutic attributes. By promoting these lifestyle modifications and addressing their limitations and barriers to their adoption, it is hoped that their preventative and remedial benefits may galvanize therapeutic progress for neuropsychiatric disorders.","output":"The Effect of Exercise on Mental Health: A Focus on Inflammatory Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forests have ecological and sociological functions, including tourism development as well as disaster mitigation efforts.

The SARS COV-2 pandemic has resulted in a plethora of resources to support the well-being of frontline workers. Developing a well-being system for an anesthesia department using these resources may be complex to implement. AIMS: In this article we outline how an anesthesia department can design and implement a framework for wellbeing, regardless of resources and financial constraints. We use the example of a free online toolkit developed in Australia for anesthetists. METHODS: The \\"Long lives, Healthy Workplaces toolkit\\" is a framework which has been specifically developed by mental health experts for anesthetists, and does not require departments to pay for external experts.1 Departments can design a long-term model of evidence-based mental health strategies to meet their unique needs using five steps outlined in the toolkit and detailed in this article. The framework uses cycles of assessment and review to create an adaptable approach to incorporate emerging evidence. We explain how culture can impact the implementation of a well-being framework and we outline how departments can set goals and priorities. CONCLUSION: Departments have different constraints which will alter how they approach supporting anaesthetists' wellbeing. Regardless of location or funding all departments should explicitly address anesthetists well-being. Long term sustainable well-being programs require a strategic and coordinated approach.","output":"Workplace well-being in pediatric anesthesia: How to design and implement a bespoke evidence-based framework in your department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Pharmacist-patient interactions via telehealth have been described in rural settings (Littauer SL, et al Pharm Pract 2017;15(4):1134), long-term care (Kane-Gill SL, et al Consult Pharm 2017;32(2):93-8), and other populations As institutions adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative solutions were needed, and pharmacists were incorporated into telehealth more broadly (Elson EC, et al AJHP 2020;77(13):1005-6) In April, we transitioned a majority of appointments to telehealth The CF team pharmacist maintained current standards of care, but incorporated a virtual medication tour utilizing this new technology to provide a service usually only available via home health visits Methods: Patients 18 years and older were asked by the pharmacist to provide a virtual tour of their medications during the visit They were prompted to show areas of the home where medications were stored The pharmacist evaluated whether or not storage conditions were appropriate This included determining if medications were within reach of children, and appeared to be stored appropriately in regards to temperature, humidity, and light exposure The primary outcome was to determine patient willingness to participate in virtual medication tours The secondary outcome was to identify potential interventions that could be achieved by incorporating this practice Results: Of 20 patients seen via telehealth for a CF clinic appointment between April and June 2020, 13 patients were willing to participate in a virtual medication tour Through this process, we found 3 of 4 participating patients with a child under 12 years old had medications stored in a place accessible to children All patients had their medications stored at the correct temperature Only one patient had a medication stored inappropriately based on potential light exposure Overall, 86 4% of patients had some style of pill organizer, either store-bought or homemade, as part of their medication storage strategy Information about one or more OTC products or supplements was missing from the medication list at the start of 25% of telehealth visits A virtual medication tour allowed for resolution of this information 80% of the time Other discrepancies between the medication list and home medication regimen were identified during only one visit Discussion: Our initial findings demonstrate that a virtual medication tour led by a pharmacist can be successfully incorporated into telehealth visits, and was accepted by a majority of patients Of those who did not participate, most attributed this to being in an alternate location during the telehealth visit, such as office or workplace, or quarantining at another household during the COVID-19 pandemic where they felt medication storage did not accurately reflect their usual practices or habits Based on pharmacist observations during virtual medication tours, most patients were already properly storing medications for stability, but might benefit from targeted education on variation of temperature within refrigerators, light sensitivity of certain medications, and ability of children or pets to inappropriately gain access to supplies We plan to offer a poison prevention education day via webinar to patients and families later this year based on these findings","output":"Virtual medication tour with pharmacist as part of cystic fibrosis telehealth visit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) outbreak is a public health emergency and a global pandemic.

In this study, the protective effect of Yixin-shu (YXS) capsules, a conventional medicine for various cardiovascular diseases, against myocardial ischemia-induced HF in rats was systematically investigated by RNA-seq technology. HF rats treated with YXS (0.8 or 1.6 g/kg/d, ig) for 6 weeks had significantly decreased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and collagen III and attenuated cardiac structure rupture and collagen deposition. Additionally, YXS treatment decreased the levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and TUNEL-positive rate and the nitrotyrosine staining, but increased levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Further experiments demonstrated that YXS restored Trx2 and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, thereby improving cardiac function in the rats with HF. Silencing Trx2 decreased the protection of YXS in the response to H(2)O(2) as evidenced by the increase of caspase-3 activity and decrease of GSH level. Thus, YXS enhanced heart function and decreased myocardial damage through restoring Trx2 and inhibiting JNK and p38 activation in ischemia-induced HF.","output":"Yixin-Shu Capsules Ameliorated Ischemia-Induced Heart Failure by Restoring Trx2 and Inhibiting JNK/p38 Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a concern that as a result of COVID-19 there will be a shortage of ventilators for patients requiring respiratory support.

We argue that there is no ethically relevant difference between withdrawing and withholding treatment and that suggesting otherwise may have problematic consequences. If doctors are discouraged from withdrawing treatment, concern about a future shortage may make them reluctant to provide ventilation to patients who are unlikely to have a successful outcome. This may result in underutilisation of available resources.

However, results are mostly available too late to have an impact on patient management. The latest developments include appropriate DNA- and RNA-based amplification techniques (both NASBA and PCR) for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for LRTI. Real time amplification, the latest technical progress, produces, within a considerable shorter time, results with a lower risk of false positives. As results can be obtained within the same day, patient management with appropriate therapy or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic therapy in LRTI will be possible. A number of technical aspects of these amplification assays, and their advantages are discussed. The availability and use of these new diagnostic tools in virology has contributed to a better understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in LRTI. The increasing importance of the viral agents, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in ARI is illustrated. A great proportion of ARI are caused by viruses, but their relative importance depends on the spectrum of agents covered by the diagnostic techniques and on the populations studied, the geographical location and the season. The discovery of new viruses is ongoing; examples are the hMPV and the increasing number of coronaviruses. Indications for the use of these rapid techniques in different clinical situations are discussed. Depending on the possibilities, the laboratory could optimize its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of immunofluorescence for the detection of RSV an IFL, and a combination of real-time amplification tests for other respiratory viruses and the atypical agents.

It has many faces. One of them are the tragic cases of poisoning of refugees due to eating wild forest mushrooms for socioeconomic reasons in the Western and Northern European countries. The most serious food poisonings in Europe, but not only, are caused by lamellar mushrooms, the most dangerous being Amanita phalloides. Its poisonous properties can be attributed to -amanitin, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor. Unfortunately, as it is characterized by a delayed onset of symptoms, A. phalloides poisoning has a high risk of complications. CASE PRESENTATION: Our article presents a case of A. phalloides poisoning in a 28-year-old man, in which the responding medical emergency unit made errors in diagnosis and treatment. Since the correct diagnosis was made too late, the typical treatment of A. phalloides poisoning was ineffective. The patient suffered a life-threatening liver failure and needed liver transplant from a deceased donor. CONCLUSIONS: Mushroom poisoning is a particularly important problem not only in countries with a mushroom picking tradition, but alsodue to the inflow of refugeesin countries where mushroom poisoning was very rare until recently. In such cases it is crucial to quickly implement the correct procedure, as this can prevent the need for liver transplant or even death. This is a particularly important consideration for the first medical professionals to contact the patient, especially in cases where the patient reports mushrooms consumption and presents alarming symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract.

Our objective was to define if severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased bioactive lipids modulating lung inflammation. A targeted lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by tandem mass spectrometry was done on 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Statistical models to evaluate the different outcomes of the study-arms will include study-arm as a factor along with any covariate that might affect the results. To ensure that the effects of the covariates are confounded to the least possible extent with the effects of the arms, stratified randomization can be applied. However, there is at present no clear-cut procedure when there are multiple covariates. METHODS: For parallel study designs with simultaneous enrollment of all subjects prior to intervention, we propose a D-optimal blocking procedure to allocate subjects with known values of the covariates to the study arms. We prove that the procedure minimizes the variances of the baseline differences between the arms corrected for the covariates. The procedure uses standard statistical software. RESULTS: We demonstrate the potential of the method by an application to a human parallel nutritional intervention trial with three arms and 162 healthy volunteers. The covariates were gender, age, body mass index, an initial composite health score, and a categorical indicator called first-visit group, defining groups of volunteers who visit the clinical centre on the same day (17 groups). Volunteers were allocated equally to the study-arms by the D-optimal blocking procedure. The D-efficiency of the model connecting an outcome with the study-arms and correcting for the covariates equals 99.2%. We simulated 10,000 random allocations of subjects to arms either unstratified or stratified by first-visit group. Intervals covering the middle 95% of the D-efficiencies for these allocations were [82.0, 92.0] and [93.2, 98.4], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Allocation of volunteers to study-arms with a D-optimal blocking procedure with the values of the covariates as inputs substantially improves the efficiency of the statistical model that connects the response with the study arms and corrects for the covariates.

Materials and Methods: single-center, prospective, cohort study included 177 routine cataract surgery cases of two experienced surgeons between November 2019 and December 2020. Inclusion criteria included unremarkable postoperative day one follow-up examination. A set of seven questions regarding complaints with positive or negative answers was presented at the second follow-up visit (PV2)one week (mean 8.34  1.73 days) after the surgery. The outcome measures were the incidence of unexpected management changes (UMCs) at the PV2 visit (change or addition from a prescribed postoperative drop plan, extra procedures, an urgent referral to an ophthalmologist) and UMCs associations with the answers to a question set. Results: 81.4% of patients had no complaints about postoperative ocular status and answered with negative answers, 18.6% reported one or more complaint (positive answer): dissatisfaction with postoperative visual acuity (6.2%, 11 cases), eye pain (4.0%, 7 cases), increase in floaters after the surgery (4.0%, 7 cases), red eye (4.0%, 7 cases) and others. The prevalence of UMCs at PV2 was 1.7% (3 cases), of which 0.6% (1 case) was the prolonged antibiotic prescription due to conjunctivitis, 0.6% (1 case) was the addition of IOP lowering medication and 0.6% (1 case) was additional medication due to uveitis management. None of the complaints (positive answers) at PV2 were associated with the incidence of UMCs (p > 0.05). Conclusions: there were no associations of UMCs determined with positive answers to the questions. The prediction of UMCs incidence based on the positive answers was not obtained.

We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. RESULTS: We included 168 691 people with a recorded diagnosis of RAIRD alive on 01/03/2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5C75.4) years, and 118 379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value of 85%. 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4C3838.1 per 100 000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42C1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher.

Evolutionary psychology has advanced our understanding of why humans suffer psychological distress and mental illness. However, to date, the evolutionary origins of what drives humans to alleviate the suffering of others has received limited attention. Therefore, we draw upon evolutionary theory to assess why humans psychologically support one another, focusing on the interpersonal regulation of emotions that shapes how humans heal and console one another when in psychosocial distress. To understand why we engage in psychological healing, we review the evolution of cooperation among social species and the roles of emotional contagion, empathy, and self-regulation. We discuss key aspects of human biocultural evolution that have contributed to healing behaviors: symbolic logic including language, complex social networks, and the long period of childhood that necessitates identifying and responding to others in distress. However, both biological and cultural evolution also have led to social context when empathy and consoling are impeded. Ultimately, by understanding the evolutionary processes shaping why humans psychologically do or do not heal one another, we can improve our current approaches in global mental health and uncover new opportunities to improve the treatment of mental illness across cultures and context around the world.","output":"Why we heal: The evolution of psychological healing and implications for global mental health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media platforms have become part of many peoples lives.

The present goal was to understand the molecular mechanisms of LYC preventing DEHP-induced lipid metabolism of liver. The mice were intragastrically administered with LYC (5 mg/kg) and/or DEHP (500 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg). Here, we found that LYC attenuated DEHP-caused hepatic histopathological lesions including steatosis. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed that LYC ameliorated DEHP-caused liver function and lipid metabolism disorders. DEHP caused lipid metabolism disorders via activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor / (PPAR/) signal transducer and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/Liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway. As a major regulator of lipid metabolism, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) system was elevated with increased fatty degeneration under DEHP exposure. However, LYC could decrease the levels of HIF-1/PPAR/PPAR/FXR/LXR signaling pathway related factors.

The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health is expected to be immense and likely to be long-lasting, raising a range of global problems that need to be addressed accordingly. AIM: To analyze the Scopus-based depression research and COVID-19, explain the advancement of research nowadays, and comment on the possible hotspots of depression research and COVID-19 to obtain a more global perspective. METHODS: In this report, bibliometric analysis and visualization are used to explain COVID-19's global research status on depression and provide researchers with a guide to identify future research directions. Relevant studies on depression and COVID-19 were retrieved from the Scopus database. Visualization maps were produced using the VOSviewer software, including research collaboration. RESULTS: At the time of data collection (November 18, 2020), 77217 documents were released by Scopus to COVID-19 in all areas of research. By limiting the search to depression and COVID-19 (January 2020 up until November 18, 2020), there are 1274 published articles on depression and COVID-19 in the Scopus. The great majority of which are original articles (n = 1049, 82.34%), followed by 118 review articles (9.26%), 66 letters (5.18%).

Overall, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection generally had milder disease compared to adults, though the cause is not clear. The objective of this study was to compare the humoral response to infection in children vs. adults of a same family. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study at Sainte-Justine University Health Center in Montreal, Canada from July 2020 to March 2021. Children with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were recruited from the COVID-19 clinic (index case), enrollment was offered to all household members. Serum IgG against SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 spike proteins was measured using the Diasorin (Liaison XL) assay, 4-6 months following a positive PCR. A mean antibody threshold of 15 Arbitrary unit per ml (AU/ml) was considered seropositive, with 94.4% positive agreement to plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) at a 1:40 ratio. Antibody titer was compared between children and adults. RESULTS: 111 participants (52 adults and 59 children) were recruited from 50 separate families. Characteristic of participants and their clinical symptoms are described in Table 1. Among all participants, 76.3% children were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive vs. 51.9% of adults (p=0.007).

In the context of alcohol use behaviours, interoceptive signals may shape subjective alcohol experiences and thereby support biobehavioural mechanisms of drinking behaviour change. This study examined the acute effects of alcohol on participants' interoceptive abilities and determined whether pharmacologically induced changes in heart beat detection correlate with subjective alcohol effects, craving and expectancies. Participants completed a two-session, double-blind placebo controlled experiment (n = 27). Participants consumed a beverage containing 0.4 g/kg of alcohol or a placebo. They also completed measurements of alcohol expectancies at baseline, and alcohol-induced changes in mood, craving and light-headedness. Interoceptive ability was measured using the heartbeat discrimination task prior to and following beverage administration, yielding indices of interoceptive accuracy, confidence and meta-cognition. Alcohol administration increased interoceptive accuracy compared with baseline and placebo; and those changes in interoception negatively correlated with negative alcohol expectancies. Further, changes in interoception positively correlated with perceived light-headedness and positive mood after alcohol administration, whereas null effects were found for craving. In the placebo condition, null results were obtained. Alcohol is well established to change bodily states, and here, we find that the extent to which alcohol increases participants' sensitivity to bodily states correlates with their subjective drinking experiences. This was observed in relation to mood, light-headedness and prospective alcohol expectancies. We posit that over successive alcohol experiences, changes in bodily states may feed into the development of alcohol expectancies that could in turn predict future drinking behaviours.","output":"Changes in interoception after alcohol administration correlate with expectancies and subjective effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Outbreak of COVID-19 seems to have exacerbated across the globe, including Bangladesh.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study is conducted in the context of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 positive 5,589 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the COVID-19 testing laboratory, Abdul Malek Ukil Medical College, Noakhali-3800, Bangladesh. For molecular confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), standard diagnostic protocols through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted. Different patient demographics were analyzed using SPSS version 22 for exploring the relationship of three factors C age, sex, and residence with a cumulative number of COVID-19 positive cases and prevalence of COVID-19 in four districts in Chattogram division. The data was recorded between May to July, 2020. RESULTS: Among the three parameters, the present study revealed that 20C40 cohort had the highest incidence of infection rate (51.80%, n = 2895) among the different age groups. Among the infected individuals, 56.8% (n = 3177) were male and 43.2% (n = 2412) were female, denoting males being the most susceptible to this disease. Urban residents (52.7%, n = 2948) were more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those residing in rural areas (47.3%, n = 2641).

Created in the context of a global call for extractive industry accountability, as well as increasing scrutiny of Canadian mining activities for alleged human rights and environmental abuses, the ESTMA aims to deter corruption via financial reporting requirements for Canadian extractive firms operating in Canada and abroad. By mandating that firms publicly disclose payments to various levels of government, however, the ESTMA is constructed atop global corruption discourse that identifies host states in the Global South as the source of social pathologies that facilitate corruption, largely excluding a critical analysis of extractive firms in the Global North. Drawing on interviews, document analysis of material related to the ESTMA and case studies of extractive firm financial reporting, this paper argues that under the ESTMA's financial reporting processes, corporate risk management trumps meaningful social regulation. While the Act does mandate disclosures useful to the advocacy community, limited oversight, a lack of standardized reporting and excluded activities under the Act mean that the ESTMA offers limited leverage to substantively address the human and ecological cost of Canada's extractive industry. As has resulted from transparency policies more broadly, however, the ESTMA provides firms a means to counter broader critique and, in complying with audit culture, promotes investment security.","output":"Enhancing corporate standing, shifting blame: An examination of Canada's Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis at discharge is important in mitigating venous thromboembolism events from colorectal cancer and major abdominopelvic surgery, both of which are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Foundation doctors frequently rotate between departments, and so rely on departmental induction and/or handing down of knowledge to prescribe extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis upon discharge. METHODS: A retrospective audit of all patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at The County Hospital, Hereford, between 1 August 2018 and 31 August 2019, was undertaken to assess departmental compliance with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients underwent elective surgery and 29 patients had emergency surgery. The initial audit revealed a cyclical 4-monthly decline that coincided with foundation doctors' rotations. Six multidisciplinary interventions were implemented. Reaudit demonstrated 100% compliance with prescribing of extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis at discharge. No venous thromboembolism events 30 days post operation were noted. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach involving educating health professionals about the importance of extended venous thromboembolis prophylaxis in patients who have undergone surgery for colorectal cancer can be effective in improving compliance with prescribing practices at discharge.","output":"Improving prescribing of extended prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism at discharge in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Following a pandemic, laboratory medicine is vulnerable to laboratory errors due to the stressful and high workloads. We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. Materials and methods: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra- and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values. Results: When the pre- and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in pre-pandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7&#963; vs. 5.4&#963;, P = 0.003). The sigma values of samples transported inappropriately and haemolysed samples were significantly higher in pre-pandemic period than during pandemic (5.0&#963; vs. 4.9&#963;, 4.3&#963; vs. 4.1&#963;; P = 0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively). Sigma value of tests with inappropriate IQC performances was lower during pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (3.3&#963; vs. 3.2&#963;, P = 0.081). Sigma value of the reports delivered outside the specified time was higher during pandemic than pre-pandemic period (3.0&#963; vs. 3.1&#963;, P = 0.030).

We study the impact of such an event on compliance behaviour in one country C Pakistan C and find that, in a large sample of University students, compliance declines immediately after the religious holiday. Our effects are identified by unprompted delays in fielding a survey measuring compliance with prescribed behaviours. We report a decline in compliance, with no observable decline in other well documented predictors of compliance behaviours (that is, risk perceptions, or trust in the authorities). We find that this decline in compliance is largely attributable to male participants, with one important exception.

The frozenCthawed spermatozoa retain practical fertilization rates after 1 (51%) or even 3 months (25%) with the C57BL/6 J strain, the most sensitive strain for sperm freezing. More than half of the embryos thus obtained developed into offspring after embryo transfer. Importantly, spermatozoa stored at ?80 C can be transferred into liquid nitrogen for indefinite storage. As far as we know, our EQ method is the easiest and quickest method for mouse sperm freezing and should be applicable in all laboratories without expertise in sperm cryopreservation.

METHODS: A literature review was performed, searching all available online databases and resources. The Medical Subject Headings 'tonsillitis', 'pharyngotonsillitis', 'quinsy', 'peritonsillar abscess' and 'epistaxis' were used. Papers discussing out-patient management were reviewed by the authors. RESULTS: Out-patient and ambulatory pathways for tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess are well described for patients meeting appropriate criteria. Safe discharge of select patients is safe and should be encouraged in the current clinical climate. Safe discharge of patients with epistaxis who have bleeding controlled is also well described.

Epidemiological and sociological studies with one or more determinants of the health, as well as relevant qualitative studies characterizing risk factors, well-being indicators, and lifestyles of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in Russia published from 2004 to 2019 in Russian and English languages were included in the review. Despite significant limitations of the available research literature in the field, some patterns in migrants health in Russia and issues that need to be addressed were identified. In particular, the syndemic epidemics of communicable and non-communicable diseases, additively increasing negative health consequences, including cardiovascular diseases and chronic digestive system diseases, high rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, respiratory diseases and a growing percentage of new tuberculosis cases among migrants from the former Soviet Union countries are all of great concern. Possibly, the burden of these co-occurring morbidities is linked to commonly reported issues among this population group, such as poor nutrition and living conditions, high prevalence of unskilled manual labour, non-compliance with sanitary norms, lack of basic vaccinations, lack of basic knowledge about safe sexual practices and risky sexual behaviour, low healthcare seeking behaviour and limited access to health care. Importantly, these findings may urge the government to increase efforts and promote international collaboration in combating the threat of infectious diseases. Additionally, it was found that migrants had higher levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and those who stayed in the receiving country 5 years or more had a higher level of somatic pathology than those whose stay was less than 5 years.

The present study demonstrated that N protein in the MHV virion nucleocapsid and in the intracellular genome-length RNP complex that bound to viral envelope M protein was tightly self-associated such that its association was retained even after extensive RNase A-treatment of the RNP complexes. The RNase A-resistant tight N protein association in the virion nucleocapsid was not mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bridge between N proteins. In contrast, N protein association in the majority of the intracellular RNP complexes was susceptible to RNase A-treatment.

Hitherto, the mechanical properties of the silk fibres have been explored mainly by tensile tests, which provide information on their strength, Young's modulus, strain at break and toughness modulus. Several hypotheses have been based on these data, but the intrinsic and often overlooked variability of natural and artificial silk fibres makes it challenging to identify trends and correlations. In this work, we determined the mechanical properties of Bombyx mori cocoon and degummed silk, native spider silk, and artificial spider silk, and compared them with classical commercial carbon fibres using large sample sizes (from 10 to 100 fibres, in total 200 specimens per fibre type). The results confirm a substantial variability of the mechanical properties of silk fibres compared to commercial carbon fibres, as the relative standard deviation for strength and strain at break is 10-50%. Moreover, the variability does not decrease significantly when the number of tested fibres is increased, which was surprising considering the low variability frequently reported for silk fibres in the literature. Based on this, we prove that tensile testing of 10 fibres per type is representative of a silk fibre population. Finally, we show that the ideal shape of the stress-strain curve for spider silk, characterized by a pronounced exponential stiffening regime, occurs in only 25% of all tested spider silk fibres.","output":"Artificial and natural silk materials have high mechanical property variability regardless of sample size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

It is important to develop reliable biomarker(s) with specificity, sensitivity and convenience for early diagnosis. The role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and survival of GC patients are controversial. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) regulates monocytes/macrophages. Elevated MCSF is correlated with invasion, metastasis and poor survival of tumour patients. IL-34, a ligand of the M-CSF receptor, acts as a twin to M-CSF, demonstrating overlapping and complimentary actions. IL-34 involvement in tumours is controversial, possibly due to the levels of M-CSF receptors. While the IL-34/M-CSF/M-CSFR axis is very important for regulating macrophage differentiation, the specific interplay between these cytokines, macrophages and tumour development is unclear. METHODS: A multi-factorial evaluation could provide more objective utility, particularly for either prediction and/or prognosis of gastric cancer. Precision medicine requires molecular diagnosis to determine the specifically mutant function of tumours, and is becoming popular in the treatment of malignancy. Therefore, elucidating specific molecular signalling pathways in specific cancers facilitates the success of a precision medicine approach. Gastric cancer tissue arrays were generated from stomach samples with TNM stage, invasion depth and the demography of these patients (n = 185). Using immunohistochemistry/histopathology, M-CSF, IL-34 and macrophages were determined. RESULTS: We found that IL-34 may serve as a predictive biomarker, but not as an independent, prognostic factor in GC; M-CSF inversely correlated with survival of GC in TNM IIICIV subtypes. Increased CD68(+) TAMs were a good prognostic factor in some cases and could be used as an independent prognostic factor in male T3 stage GC. CONCLUSION: Our data support the potency of IL-34, M-CSF, TAMs and the combination of IL-34/TAMs as novel biological markers for GC, and may provide new insight for both diagnosis and cellular therapy of GC.","output":"Inverse correlation between Interleukin-34 and gastric cancer, a potential biomarker for prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is currently available.

The questionnaire gathered general demographic information, and included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12); Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire (MBTI); Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21); and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The data were collected automatically and electronically. Univariate analysis was done between all the variables and our dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the associations between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with the associated variables. Results: We collected 505 complete answers. The participants included 269 nurses (53.27%), 206 clinicians (40.79%), 15 administrative staff (2.97%), and 15 other staff (2.97%). Of these, 76.63% declared they would accept the vaccine. The major barriers were concerns about safety, effectiveness, and the rapid mutation in the virus. Moreover, four factors were significantly associated with the willingness to receive the vaccine: (a) understanding of the vaccine (odds ratio (OR):2.322; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.355 to 3.979); (b) worried about experiencing COVID-19 (OR 1.987; 95% CI: 1.197C3.298); (c) flu vaccination in 2020 (OR 4.730; 95% CI: 2.285 to 9.794); and (d) living with elderly individuals (OR 1.928; 95% CI: 1.074C3.462).

The results were used to investigate the effect of daily activities and smoking time on the smoking topography. Moreover, correlations between the smoking topography parameters and biomarkers were assessed. RESULTS No significant effect of either the daily activities or time on the smoking topography of the subjects was observed. Synchronic correlations of the cigarette consumption per day (CPD) and the average flow per puff with both urinary cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine were significant.

Nevertheless, few data are available regarding their force-generating capacities. The objective of this study was to provide a model of the force-length-activation relationships of the hand extensors using non-invasive methods. The extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) were studied as representative of wrist and finger extensors. Ten participants performed isometric extension force-varying contractions in different postures on an ergometer recording resultant moment. The joint angle, the myotendinous junction displacement and activation were synchronously tracked using motion capture, ultrasound and electromyography. Muscle force was estimated via a musculoskeletal model using the measured joint angle and moment. The force-length-activation relationship was then obtained by fitting a force-length model at different activation levels to the measured data. The obtained relationships agreed with previously reported data regarding muscle architecture, sarcomere length and activation-dependent shift of optimal length. Muscle forces estimated from kinematics and electromyography using the force-length-activation relationships were comparable, below 15% differences, to those estimated from moment via the musculoskeletal model. The obtained quantitative data provides a new insight into the different muscle mechanics of finger and wrist extensors.

Most reporting on these disparities is based on predetermined administrative districts that may not reflect true neighborhoods. We undertook a ranking project to describe health at the neighborhood level and used Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as our case study. METHODS: To create neighborhood health rankings, we first divided the city into neighborhoods according to groups of contiguous census tracts. Modeling our ranking methods and indicators on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings, we gathered census tractClevel data from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions 500 Cities Project and local sources and aggregated these data, as needed, to each neighborhood. We assigned composite scores and rankings for both health outcomes and health factors to each neighborhood. RESULTS: Scores for health outcomes and health factors were highly correlated. We found clusters of neighborhoods with low rankings in Philadelphias northern, lower northeastern, western, and southwestern regions. We disseminated information on rankings throughout the city, including through a comprehensive webpage, public communication, and a museum exhibit. CONCLUSION: The Philadelphia neighborhood health rankings were designed to be accessible to people unfamiliar with public health, facilitating education on drivers of health in communities.

Methods: We included 244 COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with no preexisting cardiovascular disease or renal dysfunction. We analyzed the data including patients' clinical characteristics, cardiac biomarkers, severity of medical conditions, and 30-day in-hospital fatality. We performed multivariable Cox regressions and the receiver operating characteristic analysis to assess the association of cardiac biomarkers on admission with disease severity and prognosis. Results: In this retrospective observational study, 11% of COVID-19 patients had increased hs-cTnI levels (>40 ng/L) on admission. Of note, serum hs-cTnI levels were positively associated with the severity of medical conditions (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 6.00 [6.00-6.00] ng/L in 91 patients with moderate conditions, 6.00 [6.00-18.00] ng/L in 107 patients with severe conditions, and 11.00 [6.00-56.75] ng/L in 46 patients with critical conditions, P for trend=0.001). Moreover, compared with those with normal cTnI levels, patients with increased hs-cTnI levels had higher in-hospital fatality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 4.79 [1.46-15.69]). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the inclusion of hs-cTnI levels into a panel of empirical prognostic factors substantially improved the prediction performance for severe or critical conditions (area under the curve (AUC): 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78) vs. 0.65 (0.58-0.72), P=0.01), as well as for 30-day fatality (AUC: 0.91 (0.85-0.96) vs. 0.77 (0.62-0.91), P=0.04). A cutoff value of 20 ng/L of hs-cTnI level led to the best prediction to 30-day fatality. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients with no preexisting cardiovascular disease, 11% had increased hs-cTnI levels. Besides empirical prognostic factors, serum hs-cTnI levels upon admission provided independent prediction to both the severity of the medical condition and 30-day in-hospital fatality.

While the body of literature on the relationship of COVID transmission and mobility is large, studies mostly captured a relatively short timeframe. Moreover, spatial non-stationarity has garnered less attention in these explorative models. Therefore, the major concern of this study is to see the relationship of mobility and COVID on a broader temporal scale and after mitigating this methodological gap. OBJECTIVE: In response to this concern, this study first explores the spatiotemporal pattern of mobility indicators. Secondly, it attempts to understand how mobility is related to COVID infection rate and how this relationship has been changed over time and space after controlling several sociodemographic characteristics, spatial heterogeneity, and policy-related changes during different phases of Coronavirus. DATA AND METHOD: This study uses GPS-based mobility data for a wider time frame of six months (March 20-August20) divided into four tiers and carries analysis for all the US counties (N = 3142). Space-time cube is used to generate the spatiotemporal pattern. For the second objective, Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Error Model (SEM), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were used. RESULT: The spatial-temporal pattern suggests that the trip rate, out-of-county trip rate, and miles/person traveled were mostly plummeted till the first wave reached its peak, and subsequently, all of these mobility matrices started to rise. From spatial models, infection rates were found negatively correlated with miles traveled and out-of-county trips. Highly COVID infected areas mostly had more people working from home, low percentages of aged people and educated people, and high percentages of poor people. CONCLUSION: This study, with necessary policy implications, provides a comprehensive understanding of the shifting pattern of mobility and COVID. Spatial models outperform OLS with better fits and non-clustered residuals.","output":"Spatial association of mobility and COVID-19 infection rate in the USA: A county-level study using mobile phone location data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"L'obesite est un facteur de risque d'intubation dans formes graves de pneumopathie COVID-19 : une etude cas-controles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HCWs). We aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCWs in comparison to the stress brought on by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Saudi Arabia. METHOD: Between February 5th and 16th, 2020, 811 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary care teaching hospital were invited to fill a questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the novel coronavirus pandemic, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Anxiety Severity screening tool. RESULTS: Out of 582 HCWs who completed the survey questionnaire (response rate of 71.8%), about 40% were exposed previously to MERS-CoV infected or suspected patients during a previous hospital outbreak. While there were no COVID-19 cases reported yet in Saudi Arabia at the time of data collection, still, the anxiety level from COVID-19 was significantly higher than that from MERS-CoV or seasonal influenza: 41.1% were more worried about COVID-19, 41.4% were similarly worried about both MERS-CoV and COVID-19, and 17.5% were more stressed by the previous MERS-CoV hospital outbreak. The most frequent concern was transmitting the infection to family and friends (2.71/5) than to themselves only (2.57/5). CONCLUSION: Pandemic and epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19 or MERS-CoV impose a significant level of anxiety and stress on healthcare workers who are caring of infected patients, with their main concern being the risk of transmitting the infection to their families or to acquire it themselves. Therefore, optimizing the compliance of healthcare workers with the proper infection prevention and control measures is paramount during the infectious disease outbreak, to ensure their safety, to decrease the likelihood of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others, and consequently to alleviate their psychological stress and anxiety.","output":"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers in a MERS-CoV endemic country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an active pandemic that has required rapid conversion of practice patterns to mitigate disease spread.

Our research question was how can an educational vignette, depicting a fictitious patient with a history of substance use and mental health disorders accessing dental care, promote an open dialogue about stigma? METHODS: An educational vignette was developed based on individuals lived-experiences with a variety of substance use and/or mental health disorders. This vignette was used to generate in-class discussion involving all the DMD and BDSc-DH undergraduate students enrolled between 2015/16 and 2018/19 who attended a mandatory 2.5 h didactic session using an inverted classroom approach. Students were also encouraged to provide a post-class voluntary written reflection, between 200 and 300 words, around stigma. The authors took written field notes on students response to the vignette and used excerpts from students de-identified reflections to illustrate the impact of such an educational tool. RESULTS: A total of 323 DMD and BDSc-DH students attended the didactic sessions between 2015/16 and 2018/19, and 148 reflections were submitted over the same time period.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to examine research on interventions addressing social media skills and safety, with a focus on people living with health conditions; free web-based resources for the general public on social media skills training; and currently available online support groups for people with ABI. METHODS: An integrative scoping review was conducted, with a systematic search strategy applied in March and November 2020 across OvidSP (MEDLINE, AMED, PsycINFO, and Embase), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Google, and Facebook. The data collected were critically appraised and synthesized to describe the key content and features of social media training resources. RESULTS: This review identified 47 peer-reviewed academic articles, 48 social media training websites, and 120 online support groups for people with ABI.

Higher levels of attachment behaviors generally associated with improved trauma coping self-efficacy at the next wave within and across partners, and higher levels of trauma coping self-efficacy appeared to offset later anxiety within partners. On the other hand, within partners, greater loss is associated with lower levels of attachment behaviors within partners across time. Furthermore, higher anxiety is associated with lower levels of TCSE and higher levels of loss within partners across most lags. Finally, higher trauma coping self-efficacy is associated with less loss within men at one lag, and greater loss within men at the later lag, which may demonstrate stress and efforts to mobilize to meet it. Indirect effects were found implying the intermediary nature of anxiety and trauma coping self-efficacy in explaining wave 3 anxiety. Implications for practice and further research are discussed.","output":"Longitudinal anxiety in couples during a global pandemic: Considering loss, attachment behaviors, and trauma coping self-efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is well established that the data reported for the daily number of infected cases during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were inaccurate, primarily due to insufficient tracing across the populations. Due to the uncertainty of the first wave data mixed with the second wave data, the general conclusions drawn could be misleading. We present an uncertainty quantification model for the infected cases of the pandemic's first wave based on fluid dynamics simulations of the weather effects. The model is physics-based and can rectify a first wave data's inadequacy from a second wave data's adequacy in a pandemic curve.

Telemedicine decreases barriers to health care and brings medical specialists to underserved areas and populations. We have seen a tremendous increase in the need and utilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the lockdowns and social distancing efforts. Virtual care continues to be extended to patients to maintain their health care needs when in-person clinic appointments are not feasible or ideal such as seen during a pandemic. Telemedicine is an additional tool that has proven vital to our healthcare system. To provide optimal care, a strong technological infrastructure must be in place. Once in practice, positive outcomes have been noted for patients and healthcare providers as diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate triage can be made virtually and at the patients' convenience. To ensure high-quality care is provided through the Veterans Affairs teledermatology consultation service, we investigated the concordance of teledermatology diagnoses with clinical examination findings through a retrospective chart review covering a one-year time period. Our study found a concordance of 75.3% between the teledermatology diagnoses and the in-person clinical diagnoses. The main limitation we found to virtual examination is the inability to perform total body skin examinations. We found that 60.2% of patients had additional diagnoses when examined in person, with 8.4% of patients having an additional malignant diagnosis. These findings highlight the need for in-person examinations when feasible to ensure that no other diagnoses go undiscovered if not captured on the submitted images for teledermatology consultation. Despite the limitations posed by photographic examination, teledermatology can be used as a reliable method for diagnosis when a conventional in-person examination is not readily available or ideal, such as during a pandemic, and can serve as a powerful triaging tool.","output":"Assessing the Diagnostic Accuracy of Teledermatology Consultations at a Local Veterans Affairs Dermatology Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Because the association between erectile dysfunction (ED) and prostate biopsy is variable in the available literature, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of sexual dysfunction in males within six months of prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in four databases [MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library] and included studies focused on sexual dysfunction in men of all age groups undergoing transrectal (TRUS) or transperineal (TPBx) prostate biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer. We included studies with the International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5) scores pre-biopsy and post-biopsy at 1, 3, or 6 months. We performed an effect size meta-analysis comparing patients' baseline IIEF-5 with post-biopsy IIEF-5. RESULTS We identified nine studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which 6 examined TRUS, 2 examined TPBx, and 1 examined both. At 1-month after biopsy, the mean IIEF-5 decreased by approximately 2.2 points as determined by the effect size (-0.43, p=0.002). However, at 3 and 6-months post-biopsy, there was no difference compared to baseline (effect size=-0.08 with p=0.52 and effect size=-0.11 with p=0.18, respectively). An exploratory subgroup analysis examining TRUS at 3-months showed a statistically significantly lower mean IIEF-5 score compared to baseline (p=0.047), corresponding to an approximately 1.25-point decrease in IIEF-5.

METHODS: Laboratory data of adult COVID-19 patients (n=74) was collected in this retrospective cohort. Logistic regression was employed for risk factor evaluation and receiver operating curve was used for comparison of these risk factors for the prediction of serious outcome. Multiple regression was applied to determine the association between routine analytes and LOS. RESULTS: Higher levels of CRP (3 times), white blood cells (20%), and neutrophil counts (40%) were seen in the serious category. Odds ratio for CRP for the serious outcome was 1.052 (p=0.007) and RDW for the serious outcome was 1.218 (p=0.040) in unadjusted model and odds ratio for CRP for the serious outcome was 1.048 (p=0.024) and for RDW 1.286 (p=0.023) in adjusted model. In a multivariate regression analysis for the LOS of the unadjusted models consisting of NLR, monocyte lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the beta coefficients (BC) for the CRP were 0.006 (NLR), 0.005 (MLR) and 0.006 (PLR), whereas -0.029 (NLR), -0.034 (MLR) and -0.027 (PLR) were BCs for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients have been increasing at an alarming rate. The mortality is much higher in older individuals, especially the ones suffering from respiratory distress, cardiac abnormalities, renal diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. Existing evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 makes its entry into human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) followed by the uptake of virions through cathepsin L or transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2-mediated abnormalities in particular cardiovascular and neurological ones and the damaged coagulation systems require extensive research to develop better therapeutic modalities. As SARS-CoV-2 uses its S-protein to enter into the host cells of several organs, the S-protein of the virus is considered as the ideal target to develop a potential vaccine. In this review, we have attempted to highlight the landmark discoveries that lead to the development of various vaccines that are currently under different stages of clinical progression. Besides, a brief account of various drug candidates that are being tested to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 was also covered.

The present review discussed the origin, nature, mechanism of action, emerging aspects of genetic engineering for designing novel proteases, genome editing of fungal strains through CRISPR technology, present challenges and future recommendations of fungal proteases. The emerging evidence revealed that fungal proteases show a protective role to many environmental exposures and discovered that an imbalance of protease inhibitors and proteases in the epithelial barriers leads to the protection of chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation. Moreover, mitoproteases recently were found to execute intense proteolytic processes that are crucial for mitochondrial integrity and homeostasis function, including mitochondrial biogenesis, protein synthesis, and apoptosis. The emerging evidence revealed that CRISPR/Cas9 technology had been successfully developed in various filamentous fungi and higher fungi for editing of specific genes. In addition to medical importance, fungal proteases are extensively used in different industries such as foods to prepare butter, fruits, juices, and cheese, and to increase their shelf life.

METHODS: A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020. Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included. RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included. No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections. Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms, but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections.

Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days.

The generation of irregular rough surface is based on a random algorithm, in which the power spectrum of the roughness height function along with its probability density function can be directly prescribed. The hydrodynamic properties of the roughness are investigated and compared to those obtained from full-size DNS for 12 roughness topographies with systematically varied PDF and PS at four roughness height. The comparison confirms the viability of the minimal channel approach for characterization of rough surfaces providing excellent agreement in roughness function and zero-plane displacement across various types of roughness and different regimes. Results also indicates that different realizations of roughness, with a fixed PS and PDF, translate to similar values of roughness function with a small scatter. In addition to the global flow properties, the distribution of time-averaged surface force exerted by the roughness onto the fluid is examined and compared to the roughness height distribution for different cases. It is shown that the surface force distribution has an anisotropic structure with spanwise-elongated coherent regions. The anisotropy translates into a very small streamwise integral length scale, which weakly depends on the considered roughness topography, while the larger spanwise integral length scale shows a stronger dependence on roughness characteristics. It is also shown that the sheltering model describes well the spatial distribution of the surface force. Finally, existing roughness correlations are assessed using the present dataset.

The objective of this study was to examine the correlation of SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate per capita and COVID-19 associated deaths with number of dialysis stations and demographics of residents within ZIP codes in Cook County, Illinois. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological analysis SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on SARS-CoV-2 tests and COVID-19 associated deaths during January 21- June 15, 2020 among the 5,232,412 residents living within the 163 ZIP codes in Cook County, Illinois were merged with demographic and income data from U.S. Census Bureau. The total number of positive tests in this population was 84,353 and the total number of deaths was 4007. ASSESSMENTS: Number of dialysis stations and stations per capita within a ZIP code was calculated. The SARS-CoV-2 positive tests per capita was calculated as number of positive tests divided by the ZIP code population. COVID-19 deaths per capita were calculated as the COVID-19 deaths among residents for a given ZIP code divided by the ZIP code population. ANALYTIC APPROACH: Spearmans rank correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the correlation of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests per capita and COVID-19 deaths per capita with dialysis stations, demographics and household poverty. To account for multiple testing, statistical significance was considered as p<0.005. RESULTS: Among the 163 Cook County ZIP codes, there were 2501 dialysis stations. Positive tests per capita were significantly associated with number of dialysis stations (r = 0.25; 95% CI 0.19, 0.29; P < 0.005) but not with dialysis stations per capita (r=0.02; 95% CI -0.03, 0.08; P = 0.7). Positive tests per capita also correlated significantly with number of households living in poverty (r= 0.57; 95% CI 0.53, 0.6; P < 0.005), and percentage of residents reporting Black race (r = 0.28 p < 0.005, CI = 0.23, 0.33) and Hispanic ethnicity (r = 0.68 p < 0.001, CI: 0.65  0.7). COVID-19 deaths per capita correlated significantly with the percentage of residents reporting Black race (r=0.24; 95% CI 0.19, 0.29; P < 0.005) and with percentage of households living in poverty (r=0.34; 95% CI 0.29, 0.38; P < 0.005). The association between the number of COVID-19 deaths per capita and total number of dialysis stations (r=0.20; 95% CI 0.14, 0.25; P = 0.01) did not achieve a priori significance, while the association with dialysis stations per capita (r=0.12; 95% CI 0.07, 0.17; P = 0.01) was not significant. LIMITATIONS: Analysis is at the ZIP code level and not at the person level. CONCLUSION: The number of dialysis stations within a ZIP code correlates with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate per capita in Cook County, Illinois and this correlation may be driven by population density and the demographics of the residents. These findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for patients with ESRD living in poor urban areas.","output":"Dialysis, COVID-19, Poverty, and Race in Greater Chicago: An Ecological Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare and analyze the clinical and CT features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among four different age groups. METHODS: 97 patients (45 males, 52 females, mean age, 66.2  5.0) with chest CT examination and positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) from January 17, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into four age groups (children [0C17 years], young adults [18C44 years], middle age [45C59 years], and senior [ 60 years]) according to their age after the diagnosis was made based on PCR test and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset (two or more confirmed cases in a small area) is more common in the children group and senior group. Older patients were found to have a higher incidence of the highest clinical classification (severe or critical) in these four groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Child patients are mostly negative for chest CT or with involvement of only one lobe of the lung; while in older patients, there was a higher incidence of involvement of four or five lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement was also found to have significant differences in the four age groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging features of patients in different age groups were found to be significantly different. A better understanding of the age differences in comorbidities, cluster onset, highest clinical classification, large/multiple GGO, numbers of lobes affected, and frequency of lobe involvement can be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients of different ages.","output":"Clinical and CT features of the COVID-19 infection: comparison among four different age groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic illness which has spread rapidly and widely since December, 2019, and is identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization The pandemic to date has been characterized by ongoing cluster community transmission Quarantine intervention to prevent and control the transmission are expected to have a substantial impact on delaying the growth and mitigating the size of the epidemic To our best knowledge, our study is among the initial efforts to analyze the interplay between transmission dynamics and quarantine intervention of the COVID-19 outbreak in a cluster community In the paper, we propose a novel Transmission-Quarantine epidemiological model by nonlinear ordinary differential equations system With the use of detailed epidemiologic data from the Cruise ship Diamond Princess, we design a Transmission-Quarantine work-flow to determine the optimal case-specific parameters, and validate the proposed model by comparing the simulated curve with the real data First, we apply a general SEIR-type epidemic model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 without quarantine intervention, and present the analytic and simulation results for the epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number, the maximal scale of infectious cases, the instant number of recovered cases, the popularity level and the final scope of the epidemic of COVID-19 Second, we adopt the proposed Transmission-Quarantine interplay model to predict the varying trend of COVID-19 with quarantine intervention, and compare the transmission dynamics with and without quarantine to illustrate the effectiveness of the quarantine measure, which indicates that with quarantine intervention, the number of infectious cases in 7 days decrease by about 60%, compared with the scenario of no intervention Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to simulate the impacts of different parameters and different quarantine measures, and identify the optimal quarantine strategy that will be used by the decision makers to achieve the maximal protection of population with the minimal interruption of economic and social development [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Mathematical Models & Methods in Applied Sciences is the property of World Scientific Publishing Company and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Transmission dynamics and quarantine control of COVID-19 in cluster community: A new transmission-quarantine model with case study for diamond princess"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the structural validity and internal consistency of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation attitudes questionnaire among Allied Health Professions (AHP) university students.

Two undergraduate student cohorts (n = 40) at two Canadian universities participated in semi-structured focus groups/interviews, describing how the course may have impacted their perceptions of the aging process and of older adults. An iterative collaborative qualitative analysis demonstrated that course content stimulated a deeper understanding of the aging process, prompting a reduction in and increased awareness of ageism, and enhanced personal connection with aging, ultimately facilitating the development of an age-conscious student.

However, some people are more vulnerable to the risk of this deadly virus. The frailty of senior citizens put them at the top of this list. The past 6 months have not only presented a threat to their physical health but to mental health also. Although lockdown was necessary to check the spread of the coronavirus it culminated in an exponential rise in the problems of loneliness, anxiety, fear, helplessness, and depression. The present paper reviews the role of social networking sites, apps, and other digital platforms in saving and enriching the lives of the elderly, especially those who spent the lockdown alone and were devoid of a regular support system due to unavailability of transport and administrative restrictions on the movement of people. It also analyzes the efficiency of the virtual world in reducing their anxiety of being alone by connecting them with others and also make them feel empowered. The review is based on the online data collected about the insurgence in the percentage of elderly people using such platforms, recent studies analyzing the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on senior citizens. Besides this personal telephonic discussions were conducted with some elderly people who spent their lockdown alone in their homes. The study was primarily focused on three objectives. Firstly it attempts to understand the ways in which senior citizens made use of social networking sites and various digital platforms for managing life better. Secondly, it analyses the process of adopting technology, and finally, it examined the width and depth of the impact technology created in their life and also the permanence of this change. The analysis clearly suggests an increase in the digital life of elderly people.

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation. METHODS: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation. RESULTS: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","output":"Does non-COVID-19 lung lesion help? investigating transferability in COVID-19 CT image segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed a serious challenge not only for microbiology laboratories, but also for the clinicians in interpretation of the results. In the specialized world of medicine, knowledge of immunological and infectious diseases has been relegated to the background in many disciplines over time due to the success of antimicrobial therapies and widespread vaccination, so updating them is an urgent and essential part of the fight against the pandemic. Diagnostic tests are important tools for controlling the epidemic and caring for patients, but understanding the interaction between the virus and the human body is essential to form a correct epidemiological and medical opinion. This paper summarizes the medical methods for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the serological testing of the specific immune response of the immune system, their place, role and criteria of their evaluation according to current scientific knowledge.

The concentration of biochemical neurotransmitter alteration in the brain by MAO is directly related with several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Activated MAO also contributes to the amyloid beta (A?) aggregation by two successive cleft ?-secretase and ?3-secretase of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Additionally, activated MAO is also involved in aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive destruction through the cholinergic neuronal damage and disorder of the cholinergic system.

All emergency referrals requiring operative intervention by the plastic and reconstructive surgery unit of our institution were included. Patient demographics, place and mechanism of injury, drug and alcohol involvement, delays to presentation, length of admission and complication rates were collected. RESULTS: Demographics and complication rates were similar across all groups. A 31.8% reduction in total number of emergency cases was seen during the lockdown period. Increase in do-it-yourself injuries (P = 0.001), bicycle injuries (P = 0.001) and injuries acquired via substance abuse (P = 0.041) was observed. Head and neck injuries, mostly due to animal bites and falls, were also more prevalent compared to the same period the previous year (P = 0.007). As expected, over 80% of plastic surgery operations during the COVID-19 period were due to injuries acquired at home, a significant increase compared to previous periods. CONCLUSION: Despite changes in the pattern of presentations requiring plastic and reconstructive emergency surgery, traumatic injuries continued to occur during the pandemic. Thus, planning will be essential to ensure resource allocation for emergency procedures is sustained as second and third waves of COVID-19 cases emerge worldwide.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on emergency plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may shape population health for many years to come. Failure to address the mental health issues stemming from the pandemic is likely to prolong its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant global challenge and, in lower-income countries, even a disruption of mental health services. Given our experience with previous pandemics, the present COVID-19 crisis can be expected to cause psychological trauma, and steps are needed to address this issue proactively. A focus on the long-term mental health consequences may be at least as important as the measures currently seeking to mitigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 and to save lives. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health call for a greater focus on the needs of those with mental disorders and on mental health issues affecting health care workers and the general public. Timely preventive and therapeutic mental health care is essential in addressing the psychosocial needs of populations exposed to the pandemic. In addition to specialist care, task-shifting and digital technologies may provide cost-effective means of providing mental health care in lower-income countries worldwide as well as in higher-income countries with mental health services overwhelmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the ever-increasing pressure on global health systems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting and adapting task-shifting, i.e. the delegation of psychotherapeutic interventions to trained non-specialists, as an element of the provision of mental health services, is overdue. Digital technologies can be used to enhance social support and facilitate resilience to the detrimental mental health effects of the pandemic; they may also offer an efficient and cost-effective way to provide easy access to mental health care.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and global mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traveling to different destinations is a big part of our lives.

Indeed, those who have legalized the drug have previously approved its therapeutic use. This 'justifying a project phase' stage seems unavoidable. Therefore, it is appropriate to recall the effects and misdeeds of the drug during its recreational use. The general population surveys carried out in France for 25 years by public health France and the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction, have followed the evolution of psychoactive substances consumption. Particular attention was focused on cannabis use, which, in a context of wide dissemination for a quarter of a century, rose steadily higher among younger generations, but also among older adults. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of cannabis use among young people and adults. Last 25 years, its diffusion has continued to expand, and the experimentation rate multiplied by near 4. Estimated at 12.7% in 1992, it reached 44.8% in 2017. Moreover, 25% of users in the year aged from 18 to 64 years old were at high risk of problematic use or dependence in 2017.

Much remains unknown about host cells and tissues affected by coronavirus infections, including the hematopoietic system. Here, we discuss the recent findings examining effects that coronavirus infection or exposure has on hematopoietic cells and the clinical implications for these effects. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have centered on SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature immune cells may be susceptible to infection and are impacted functionally by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These findings have important implications regarding hematologic complications arising from COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced disease, which we discuss here. SUMMARY Infection with coronaviruses sometimes leads to hematologic complications in patients, and these hematologic complications are associated with poorer prognosis. These hematologic complications may be caused by coronavirus direct infection or impact on primitive hematopoietic cells or mature immune cells, by indirect effects on these cells, or by a combination thereof.

CHARM2 (counseling Husbands and wives to Achieve Reproductive Health and Marital Equity) builds upon a prior three-session male engagement intervention by integrating female-focused sessions emphasizing women's choice and agency (i.e., gender synchronization). We hypothesized that CHARM2 participants will be more likely to report marital contraceptive use and communication and women's contraceptive agency, and less likely to report unintended pregnancy, relative to participants in the control condition. METHODS: We conducted a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of CHARM2 on marital contraceptive use, communication, decision-making; women's contraceptive agency, and pregnancy among young married couples in rural Maharashtra, India (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03514914, complete). 40 geographic clusters, defined based on the catchment areas of subcenter health facilities (the most proximal level of community health care within India's public health system) were randomized to control (n = 20) and intervention (n = 20). We assigned all participants within that geographic cluster to the corresponding cluster treatment condition; participants, investigators, and study staff were not masked to treatment assignment. Eligibility criteria included wife aged 18C29, couple residing together for at least six months with no plan for migration, and neither spouse sterilized or infertile. The CHARM2 intervention included five provider-delivered sessions on gender equity and family planning, two delivered in parallel to husbands and wives separately by gender-matched providers, and one final joint session, delivered within the four months subsequent to baseline survey. We conducted surveys and pregnancy testing at baseline and 9-month and 18-month follow-up. We used difference-in-differences multilevel mixed effects logistic regressions to assess CHARM2 effects on marital contraceptive use and communication, and women's contraceptive agency; we used single time point mixed effects logistic regressions for pregnancy outcomes. All analyses used an intention-to-treat approach. FINDINGS: 1201 couples were recruited between September 2018 and June 2019; 600 intervention and 601 control. All couples were included in outcome analyses. Full couple retention was 902% (n = 1083) at 9-month follow-up and 905% (n = 1087) at 18-month follow-up. Modern contraceptive use was higher among intervention participants at 9-month but not 18-month follow-up (9-month adjusted ratio of odds ratio [AROR] 15, 95% CI 103C23; 18-month AROR 08, 95% CI 04C14). Communication (9-month AROR 19, 95% CI 10C36; 18-month AROR 27, 95% CI 15C48) and agency (9-month AROR 51, 95% CI 12C224; 18-month AROR 81, 95% CI 14C482) both improved at both time points. There was no significant difference in pregnancy between groups over the 18-month period (AOR 08, 95% CI 07C1.1) However, for women who expressed fertility ambivalence at baseline, unintended pregnancy was marginally less likely among intervention participants (47% vs 19%) (p = 007).

The current process of risk management for clinics is to follow a clinic-specific HVAC formula, which is typically calculated once a year and assumes perfect mixing of the air within the space, to determine how many minutes each procedural room refreshes [Formula: see text] of its air between procedures when doors are closed.

We use our data gathered from over 1500 GI cases in one clinical suite to understand the correlation between air quality and standard procedure types as well as identify the risks involved with any HVAC system in a clinical suite environment. Thanks to this system, we demonstrate that standard GI procedures generate large quantities of aerosols, which can potentially promote viral airborne transmission among patients and healthcare staff. We provide a solution for the clinic to improve procedure turnover times and throughput, as well as to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission of the virus.","output":"Gastroenterology Procedures Generate Aerosols: An Air Quality Turnover Solution to Mitigate COVID-19s Propagation Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers face a high risk of contagion during a pandemic due to their close proximity to patients. The situation is further exacerbated in the case of a shortage of personal protective equipment that can increase the risk of exposure for the healthcare workers and even non-pandemic related patients, such as those on dialysis. In this study, we propose an emergency, non-invasive remote monitoring and control response system to retrofit dialysis machines with robotic manipulators for safely supporting the treatment of patients with acute kidney disease. Specifically, as a proof-of-concept, we mock-up the touchscreen instrument control panel of a dialysis machine and live-stream it to a remote users tablet computer device. Then, the user performs touch-based interactions on the tablet device to send commands to the robot to manipulate the instrument controls on the touchscreen of the dialysis machine. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct an accuracy test. Moreover, we perform qualitative user studies using two modes of interaction with the designed system to measure the user task load and system usability and to obtain user feedback. The two modes of interaction included a touch-based interaction using a tablet device and a click-based interaction using a computer. The results indicate no statistically significant difference in the relatively low task load experienced by the users for both modes of interaction. Moreover, the system usability survey results reveal no statistically significant difference in the user experience for both modes of interaction except that users experienced a more consistent performance with the click-based interaction vs. the touch-based interaction. Based on the user feedback, we suggest an improvement to the proposed system and illustrate an implementation that corrects the distorted perception of the instrumentation control panel live-stream for a better and consistent user experience.","output":"A COVID-19 Emergency Response for Remote Control of a Dialysis Machine with Mobile HRI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the progress made in the field of the health sector across the globe From the Indian perspective, we have become the third most affected nation across the globe and the trends of the novel infection continues to worsen further All these estimates are a clear marker of the fact that we have not been up to the mark in terms of both preparedness activities as well as the public health response to the infection Amidst all these developments, there is an indispensable need that we have to divert our all our resources and adopt a multi-sectoral response for the effective containment of the infection with the active and concerted support of all the stakeholders In conclusion, the COVID-19 cases in India has been increasing on an alarming note and it is the need of the hour to continue to improve our outbreak readiness and emergency response Further, we cannot defeat the COVID-19 until we all are together in the battle against the novel infection and continue to support the Government in all their planned strategies","output":"Containment of coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in India: Need to adopt a concerted and multisectoral response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 85 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths worldwide since it occurred twelve months ago in Wuhan, China. Here we conceptualized the time-series evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January in Wuhan to early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. By scrutinizing cases from early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations has become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic. By analyzing 4,013 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to visualize the genomic diversity over a 14-week timespan since the outbreak in Wuhan. 2,954 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified with 31 of the 4,013 genomes remaining as ancestral type, and 952 (32.2%) mutations recurred in more than one genome. 11 major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were identified. As the pandemic has been unfolding for more than one year, we also used the same approach to analyze 261,323 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. including all the available viral genomes in the GISAID database as of 25 December 2020) in order to recapitulate our findings in a real-time fashion and to present a full catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We demonstrated the viral genotypic dynamics from different geographic locations over one-year timespan reveal transmission routes and indicate subsequent expansion. This study, to our knowledge, is heretofore the largest and most comprehensive genomic study of SARS-CoV-2. It indicates the viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, and guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and last but not the least help assess their accuracy and efficacy.","output":"Distinct mutations and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Olsenella uli is anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria, commonly found in oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract, which has not been reported to be associated with lower respiratory tract infection.

Research has focused on antecedents and outcomes of disclosure. More research is needed to understand the lived experiences related to disclosure decision-making and actual navigation of disclosure and concealment at work. PURPOSE To understand the experiences of persons with non-visible disabilities and illnesses regarding workplace disclosure decision-making, navigating disclosure and/or concealment, and experiential differences across disability and illness types, ages, geographic locations, and genders. METHODS We conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis using Noblit and Hare's seven steps of meta-ethnography. Searches were conducted via six databases. Studies were analyzed to develop conceptual categories, third-order constructs (themes), and a line-of-argument with comparisons drawn from the disclosure decision making model, disclosure process model, and consideration of disability and illness types, genders, ages, and geographic locations. RESULTS Twenty-four studies were included involving 489 participants, aged 16 to 81, from nine countries, focusing on one non-visible disability or illness, or multiple. We developed four themes for the disclosure decision-making process (self- and other-focused, experiential, and environmental/workplace factors) and two themes for the disclosure/concealment event (disclosure/concealment logistics and timing) and noted emerging trends across ages, genders, disability and illness types, and geographic locations.

Several models were tested through structural equation modelling. Moderation analyses reported that maladaptive strategies moderated positively anxiety, whereas adaptive strategies moderated negatively anxiety. Also, the best fitted mediation model found that worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety was mediated by CERS in different directions. Maladaptive CERS increased anxiety, whereas adaptive CERS reduced anxiety. Age (not gender) also moderated this mediation, were younger adults presented an indirect effect only through maladaptive CERS, but older adults through both adaptive and maladaptive.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected information on participants' characteristics and behavior regarding lifestyle before and during the lockdown, through the CoviDIAB web application, which is available freely for people with diabetes in France. We stratified the cohort according to BMI (25 kg/m2vs < 25 kg/m2) and examined the determinants of weight loss (WL), WL > 1 kg vs no-WL) in participants with a BMI 25 kg/m2, in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Of the 5280 participants (mean age, 52.5 years; men, 49%; diabetes, 100% by design), 69.5% were overweight or obese (mean BMI, 28.6 kg/m2 (6.1)). During the lockdown, patients often quit or decreased smoking; overweight/obese participants increased alcohol consumption less frequently as compared with normal BMI patients. In addition, overweight/obese patients were more likely to improve other healthy behaviors on a larger scale than patients with normal BMI: increased intake of fruits and vegetables, reduction of snacks intake, and reduction of total dietary intake. WL was observed in 18.9% of people with a BMI 25 kg/m2, whereas 28.6% of them gained weight. Lifestyle favorable changes characterized patients with WL.

The objective of this study was to analyze phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in city of Ribeir?o Preto at the beginning of the pandemic and during the actual second wave. Twenty-nine nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive samples were sequenced by nanopore technology (18 obtained at the initial period of the pandemic and 11 during the second wave) and analyzed them phylogenetically. The performed analysis demonstrated that the majority of the strains obtained in the initial period of the pandemic in Ribeir?o Preto belonged mainly to the B1.1.33 lineage (61.1%), but B.1.1 (27.8%) and B.1.1.28 (11.1%) lineages were also identified.

In an EIT system, the measured signal has a large dynamic range from V to mV, which requires high-RES (analog to digital conversion) cards. The logarithmic amplifier reduces the dynamic range by expanding lower values and compressing higher values, thereby improving the sensitivity and at the same time preventing the signal from saturation. In addition, a low-RES analog to digital conversion (ADC) cards can be used, making the system cost effective. This work evaluates the performance of a logarithmic amplifier and a linear amplifier used for signal conditioning in a low-cost EIT system. APPROACH: Two EIT systems based on a linear amplifier and logarithmic amplifier were designed. Phantom experiments were carried out with very small amounts of current injection. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image quality, minimum detectable size and minimum detectable conductivity change were obtained. MAIN RESULTS: The logarithmic amplifier-based EIT system increased the average SNR by 4 dB. It also showed improvement in the RES and contrast-to-noise ratio of the images. The minimum size detectable by the logarithmic amplifier-based system was of radius 0.25 cm in a tank of radius 11 cm and the minimum change in conductivity detectable was 11%.

All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed. RESULTS One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black.

Our scientific attempt is to coagulate a stable position and integrate current opposing views by advancing the idea that rather than applying the uniform lockdown policy, one could recommend instead an improved model targeting more strict and more prolonged lockdowns to vulnerable risk/age groups while enabling less stringent measures for the lower-risk groups, minimizing both economic losses and deaths.
