We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 related-health care interruption (HCI) on the physical, psychological, social relationships and environment QoL-dimensions, and explored factors associated with QoL when patients were reincorporated to the outpatient clinic, and after six-month follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study phase-1 consisted of a COVID-19 survey administered from June 24(th)-October 31(st) 2020, to outpatients with rheumatic diseases who had face-to-face consultation at outpatient clinic reopening. Study phase-2 consisted of 3 consecutive assessments of patients QoL (WHOQOL-BREF), disease activity/severity (RAPID-3), and psychological comorbidity/trauma (DASS-21 and IES-R) to patients from phase-1 randomly selected. Sociodemographic, disease and treatment-related information, and comorbidities were obtained. Multiple linear regression analysis identified factors associated with the score assigned to each WHOQOL-BREF dimension. RESULTS: Patients included (670 for phase-1 and 276 for phase-2), had primarily SLE and RA (44.2% and 34.1%, respectively), and all the dimensions of their WHOQOL-BREF were affected. There were 145 patients (52.5%) who referred HCI, and they had significantly lower dimensions scores (but the environment dimension score). Psycho-emotional factors (primarily feeling confused, depression and anxiety), sociodemographic factors (age, COVID-19 negative economic impact, years of scholarship, HCI and having a job), and biomedical factors (RAPID-3 score and corticosteroid use) were associated with baseline QoL dimensions scores. Psycho-emotional factors showed the strongest magnitude on dimensions scores. Most consistent predictor of six-month follow-up QoL dimensions scores was each corresponding baseline dimension score, while social determinants (years of scholarship and having a job), emotional factors (feeling bored), and biomedical aspects (RAPID 3) had an additional impact. CONCLUSIONS: HCI impacted the majority of patients QoL dimensions. Psycho-emotional, sociodemographic and biomedical factors were consistently associated with QoL dimensions scores, and these consistently predicted the QoL trajectory.","output":"Quality of life of patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: The biopsychosocial path"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are still few observational reports related to the incidence of re-detectable SARS-CoV-2 virus among recovered COVID-19 patients.

We evaluated baseline clinical characteristics, efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab, a next-generation humanised type-2 anti-CD20 antibody licensed for haematological malignancies in SLE patients with 2NDNR to rituximab. METHODS: We collated data from SLE patients receiving obinutuzumab for secondary non-response to rituximab in BILAG centres. Disease activity was assessed using BILAG-2004, SLEDAI-2K and serology before, and 6 months after, obinutuzumab 2x1000mg infusions alongside methylprednisolone 100 mg. RESULTS: All 9 patients included in the study received obinutuzumab with concomitant oral immunosuppression. At 6 months post-obinutuzumab, there were significant reductions in median SLEDAI-2K from 12 to 6 (p= 0.014) and total BILAG-2004 score from 21 to 2 (p= 0.009). Complement C3 and dsDNA titres improved significantly (both p= 0.04). Numerical, but not statistically significant improvements were seen in C4 levels.

Beyond these measures, cancer patients have faced up to the threat of the risk of severe COVID-19 infections and the adaptations of medical oncology practices, with potential impact on their psychological well-being. We aimed to follow Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and other Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) over this period among cancer patients from the French COVIPACT study. Methods: The COVIPACT study (NCT04366154) included patients with solid/hematologic malignancy receiving medical treatment during the first lockdown in outpatient departments of two cancer centers. Patients were asked to fulfill validated questionnaires on PTSD symptoms (IES-R), insomnia (ISI), quality of life (FACT-G) and cognition (FACT-Cog) at baseline (M0, first lockdown, Apr/May 2020), 3 months (M3, postlockdown, Jul/Aug 2020) and 6 months (M6, second lockdown, Oct/Nov 2020). PTSD was defined as an IES-R score 33 and moderate/severe insomnia as an ISI score 15. Higher values on the FACT-G (range 0-108) and FACT-Cog (PCI subscale range 0-72) indicated better quality of life and cognition, respectively. Changes in PROs over time were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures. Results:Among the 734 patients included in COVIPACT, 579, 347 and 328 completed the questionnaires at M0, M3 and M6, respectively: median age, 64 years, 72% women, 59% metastatic status. Patients were mostly treated for breast (44%), lung, head and neck (20%), digestive (16%) and gynecologic cancers (11%). We observed a J-shaped evolution of PTSD over time, affecting 21.2% of patients during the first lockdown, 13.6% the post-lockdown and 23.6% during the second lockdown (p for time &lt; 0.001). Moreover, patients reported linear deterioration of cognitive function over follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). No change was observed in any dimension of quality of life (p for time = 0.06). 24.3%, 27.1% and 28.1% of the patients reported insomnia at M0,M3 and M6 (p for time = 0.35). At each time, PTSD was associated with more insomnia, worst quality of life and cognitive complain. At all the times, 50% of patients with PTSD reported insomnia compared to 23% in non-PTSD patients (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was a clinically significant difference of 16 points on the FACT-G and 8 points on the FACT-Cog PCI between PTSD and non-PTSD patients (p &lt; 0.001) at the all times. Conclusions: More than 20% of patients have developed PTSD during the different periods of lockdown, with strong association with poor quality of life, cognitive complain and insomnia. Psychosocial support promoting emotional resilience should be largely offered to cancer patients to prevent and/or reduce PTSD.","output":"Evolution of post-traumatic stress disorder and patient reportedoutcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer patients of the French longitudinal COVIPACT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in cancellation of medical peer meetings The Chest Wall Injury Society Annual Summit was scheduled for April 2020 Due to safety concerns, the Society altered the meeting to an online format The purpose of this paper is to describe how this was accomplished and also to highlight its outcomes METHODS: An online survey of participants was carried out to assess their views on the educational yield and technical difficulties encountered as compared to in-person meetings RESULTS: Sixty two of 275 (23%) registered participants filled out the survey Eighty four percent felt that the educational quality was excellent/good Seventy five percent and 95% felt in-person meetings are better for education and for networking, respectively Eighty seven percent preferred in-person meetings in the future but would attend a virtual meeting again Thirteen percent had technical difficulties accessing the meeting CONCLUSION: Online meetings are feasible but in-person meetings have more educational and networking value","output":"Use of the Internet to Facilitate an Annual Scientific Meeting: A Report of the First Virtual Chest Wall Injury Society Summit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus can lead to variable clinical outcomes Approximately 40% of those infected will remain asymptomatic;with a similar percentage developing a mild to moderate illness, essentially localized to the respiratory system A markedly more severe and extensive illness involving multiple organs occurs in the remaining approximately 20% of those infected A further intriguing consequence of Covid-19 disease is the continuing illness in about 10% of those with either the mild to moderate or the more severe acute Covid-19 disease This Long Covid-19 syndrome has many features in common with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) The concept of coinfecting virus pathogens is central to understanding several human diseases Another useful concept is that of stealth adapted viruses These viruses differ from the viruses from which they are derived in not typically evoking inflammation This is because of deletion or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few virus components that are normally targeted by the cellular immune system It is a generic process that can potentially apply to all viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus Stealth adaptation has occurred with the cytomegaloviruses of rhesus and African green monkeys Kidney cells from African green monkeys are still being used to produce poliovirus vaccines DNA sequencing studies on these monkey-derived stealth adapted viruses show that in addition to deletions or mutations of some of the originating virus genes, stealth adaptation can involve the incorporation of additional genetic sequences from cells, other viruses, and bacteria These ?renegade? sequences become components within the reformed, replicating and infectious stealth adapted viruses The variable and diverse genetic compositions of different stealth adapted viruses are likely to at least occasionally include some elements that are interactive with genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus This could lead to the potentiation of either or both viruses with added pathogenicity for the infected individual Moreover, although the residual virus components may not be ordinarily immunogenic, some may become so if the virus levels are greatly increased and/or the immune system is sufficiently stimulated A strong case can be made for a role of stealth adapted viruses in patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome These patients can be divided into those who had similar but milder symptoms prior to Covid-19 and those who had previously been asymptomatic The former patients were probably infected earlier with a stealth adapted virus, which has now become potentiated through its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus The later patients are likely to be newly infected with a stealth adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus The next step in exploring this hypothesis is to culture the blood of patients for evidence of infection with stealth adapted viruses, followed by genetic sequencing of the positive cultures The testing should include patients who have experienced severe acute Covid-19 illness and patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome Identifying severe acute Covid-19 illness as a co-infection and the realization that the Long Covid-19 syndrome is also an infectious and transmissible disease will have important Public Health implications with regards to an expanding spectrum of human illnesses","output":"Do Stealth Adapted Viruses Predispose to More Severe and Prolonged Covid-19 Illness?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy-related (ATG) gene products regulate macroautophagy, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and LC3-dependent extracellular vesicle loading and secretion (LDELS).

It is enhanced by both innovative port technology and technical expertise learned by developing natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). DESIGN Sigmoidectomy in a human via a single laparoscopic port. SETTING University hospital. Patient A 40-year-old woman with previously documented diverticular abscess. INTERVENTIONS The multichannel single port (Triport; Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) was placed at the umbilicus. The sigmoid was retracted by both intraluminal sigmoidoscopy and magnetic anchoring. Mesenteric dissection between the mid-descending colon and the colorectal junction was carried out close to the colon using a Ligasure Advance (Covidien, Valley lab, Norwalk Connecticut). The stapler anvil was passed retrogradely per ano to lie within the descending colon. A linear stapler effected proximal and distal sigmoidal transection. Magnetic attraction then delivered the in situ anvil pike into a colotomy placed adjacent to the proximal staple line. After its position was secured with an endoloop, the pike was mated with its stapler head positioned in the rectal stump. This allowed creation of a double-stapled colorectal anastomosis 10 cm from the anal verge. Specimen retrieval was performed via the umbilical port site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Extent of scarring, occurrence of surgical complications, technical adequacy, and clinical outcome. RESULTS No intraoperative complications occurred during the 90-minute procedure. A total of 40 cm of sigmoid was resected. The patient convalesced without complication and went home 4 days after surgery. At the 1-month review, she was fully recovered and her single umbilical scar was well healed.

Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in an outpatient department (OPD). Several factors influence the high and unjustified antibiotic use in a common ailment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical audit was performed to assess antibiotic prescription rate (APR) for URTI in the pediatric OPD against the available benchmark. The prescription pattern was assessed, and interventions were formulated to improve prescription behavior. Data of all children attending OPD and fulfilling the criteria for URTI group were collected from the online hospital management system and analyzed. Interventions, in the form of discussions, presentations, posters, and guidelines (Indian Ministry of Health Guidelines for URTI) regarding etiology of URTI, and indications for antibiotic prescription were implemented. Data were monitored and feedback to consultants was given. RESULTS: The baseline APR was 14.7%. There was wide variation in APR (4.1%C53.1%) among consultants. Three consultants had a rate of 53.1%, 29.7%, and 28.6%, which was very high. Postintervention, the average APR decreased to 8.7%, a reduction of 40.8%. There was a reduction in APR among consultants with high APR as well. There was reduction in the use of azithromycin, a drug recommended for patients with penicillin allergy, from 21.2% to 14.4% (32.1% reduction). Amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid combination and amoxicillin alone continued to be the most prescribed antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Interventions through clinical audit were useful in reducing APR.

In this study, we investigated the factors associated with in-hospital outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and AKI. METHOD: In this multicenter retrospective observational study, we evaluated the characteristics and in-hospital renal and patient outcomes of 578 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and AKI. Data were collected from 34 hospitals in Turkey from March 11 to June 30, 2020. AKI definition and staging were based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Patients with end-stage kidney disease or with a kidney transplant were excluded. Renal outcomes were identified only in discharged patients. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 69 years, and 60.9% were males. The most frequent comorbid conditions were hypertension (70.5%), diabetes mellitus (43.8%), and chronic kidney disease (41.5%). The proportions of AKI stages 1, 2, and 3 were 54.0%, 24.7%, and 21.3%, respectively. 291 patients (50.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Renal improvement was complete in 80.7% and partial in 17% of the patients who were discharged. Renal outcomes were worse in patients with AKI stage 3 or baseline CKD. The overall in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 38.9%.

Our objective was to provide a detailed clinical description of an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that occurred after a sporting and social event during the early days of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study of a curling bonspiel in Edmonton held on Mar. 11C14, 2020. We used standardized interviews between Apr. 17 and May 5, 2020, to collect demographic data, travel history, symptoms (type, onset and duration), self-reported testing results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and clinical outcomes. We also obtained results of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G serology. RESULTS: All 73 curlers (55 active health care workers) who participated in the bonspiel were interviewed for the study. Convalescent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G serology was completed in 62 (85%) participants. Of the 73 participants (55 [75%] male, median age 51 [range 26C79] yr, 58 [79%] physicians), 40 curlers (55%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR; an additional 16 participants developed symptoms but had negative swabs or were not tested (14 were probable cases), for a 74% attack rate (confirmed or probable cases). Anosmia with ageusia or dysgeusia occurred in 39 of 54 (72%) confirmed or probable cases. The clinical course was mild in most participants (1 emergency visit, no hospital admissions). Transmission likely occurred from multiple individuals with minor nonspecific symptoms during the event, possibly during shared meals. INTERPRETATION: The 74% attack rate (confirmed or probable cases) highlights the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 during sporting and social events. This reinforces the need for public health measures (masking, physical distancing and limiting the size of social gatherings) during future waves of COVID-19 in Canada.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak among physicians at a Canadian curling bonspiel: a descriptive observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In childhood, a multitude of causes lead to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), an excessive surfactant accumulation in the alveolar space, limiting gas exchange.

This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19-free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared with hospitals with no defined pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19-free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS: Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19-free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19-free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score-matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76).

The current study aimed to explore the trust level and compliance with the physical distancing relationship among Arab minority and Jewish populations during three lockdowns during the COVID -19 outbreak in Israel. Three cross-sectional online surveys were conducted among a convenience sample of Jews and Arabs adults (18 years old) citizens of Israel following the first (April to June 2020), second (October to November 2020), and third lockdown (January to February 2021). The surveys collected demographic data, compliance with physical distancing, and trust level in official sources. In total, 613 (N = 281 Arab, N = 281 Jewish) participants completed the first online survey, 542 (N = 223 Arab, N = 319 Jewish) completed the second survey, and 98 (N = 38 Arab, N = 60 Jewish) completed the third survey. In the three surveys, both populations, Arabs and Jews, reported higher levels of trust in health professionals than in politicians. The level of trust and keeping physical distancing during the three lockdowns were significantly lower among Arab compared to the Jewish participants. However, the association between trust and social distancing was significant only in the first lockdown (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.37-2.97) but not in the second and third lockdowns. Trust in official directives is an important determinant of citizens' compliance with physical distancing guidelines during a pandemic. Minority groups have lower trust levels and face more challenges for keeping physical distancing. This should be brought to the policymakers' attention to increase trust and physical distancing among them. KEY MESSAGES: Understanding the relationship between trust and compliance and its potential consequences during a pandemic warrant particular attention in the present context of a global pandemic. It is of utmost importance to identify the unique characteristics of sub-populations and minority populations in which there may be additional factors affecting compliance.","output":"Trust the directives and physical distancing during three COVID-19 lockdowns in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is one of the major environmental problems that endanger human health. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an excellent opportunity to investigate the possible methods to improve Beijings air quality meanwhile considering Beijings economic impact. We used the TVP-VAR model to analyze the dynamic relationship among the pandemic, economy and air quality based on the daily data from 1 January to 30 August 2020. The result shows that the COVID-19 pandemic indeed had a positive effect on air governance which was good for human health, while doing business as usual would gradually weaken this effect. It shows that the Chinese authoritys production restriction effectively deals with air pollution in a short period of time since the pandemic is just like a quasi-experiment that suddenly suspended all the companies. However, as the limitation stops, the improvement decreases. It is not sustainable. In addition, a partial quarantine also has a positive impact on air quality, which means a partial limitation was also helpful in improving air quality and also played an important role in protecting peoples health. Second, the control measures really hurt Beijings economy. However, the partial quarantine had fewer adverse effects on the economy than the lockdown. It is supposed to be a reference for air governance and pandemic control. Third, the more the lag periods were, the smaller their impact. Thus, restrictions on production can only be used in emergencies, such as some international meetings, while it is hard to improve the air quality and create a healthy and comfortable living environment only by limitation in the long-term.","output":"The Dynamic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Air Quality: The Beijing Lessons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following topics are under this section:Fastest or Most Precise?The Viral SolutionThe Modern-Day Nostradamus: George Yuan XianzhiCORONAVIRUSES: A PRIMER PART 2","output":"Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound is a well-defined diagnostic modality in the point of care emergency medicine concept.

But for hypoplastic condyles, the implantation of Mitek anchors may cause condylar resorption. A new disc repositioning technique that sutures the disc to the posterior articular capsule through open incision avoids the implantation of the metal equipment, but the stability when combined with orthognathic surgery is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc repositioning by open suturing in patients with hypoplastic condyles when combined with orthographic surgery. METHODS: Patients with ADD and jaw deformity from 2017 to 2021 were included. Disc repositioning by either open suturing or mini-screw anchor were performed simultaneously with orthognathic surgery. MRI and CT images before and after operation and at least 6 months follow-ups were taken to evaluate and compare the TMJ disc and jaw stability. ProPlan CMF 1.4 software was used to measure the position of the jaw, condyle and its surface bone changes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with 20 hypoplastic condyles were included in the study. Among them, 12 joints had disc repositioning by open suturing and 8 by mini-screw anchor. After an average follow-up of 18.1 months, both the TMJ disc and jaw position were stable in the 2 groups except 2 discs moved anteriorly in each group. The overall condylar bone resorption was 8.3% in the open suturing group and 12.5% in the mini-screw anchor group.

At 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) as well as serum levels of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1) and creatinine were measured, and kidney tissue samples were taken for histological examination. We have found that low and high doses of rhBNP could significantly reduce kidney tissue damage, such as tubular epithelial swelling and atrophy, and interstitial cell swelling in response to LPS injection in the dog sepsis models. rhBNP administration significantly reduced SVRI and serum levels of creatinine in dogs with LPS-induced sepsis in a dose-dependent manner, and attenuated the rise in the circulating HMGB-1. In conclusion, these findings suggest that rhBNP may exert dose-dependent protective effect on kidney tissue with endotoxin-induced injury, and this effect may be associated with the changes in blood levels of HMGB-1. rhBNP may be considered as therapeutic agents for treating sepsis-induced AKI.","output":"Protective effect of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide on acute renal injury induced by endotoxin in canines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent articles have highlighted the impact of infectious diseases, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 1-3 in a developing country Pakistan,4-6 and their drastic outcomes are still going on.

COVID certification has been introduced, yet there are no empirical evaluations of its impact on vaccine uptake. Methods. Mirroring an RCT, we designed a synthetic control model comparing six countries (Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland) that introduced certification (May-August 2021), with 20 control countries. Our estimates provide a counterfactual trend estimating what would have happened in virtually identical circumstances if certificates were not introduced. The primary outcome was daily COVID-19 vaccine doses, with supplementary analyses of COVID-19 infections. Findings. COVID-19 certification led to increased vaccinations 20 days prior to implementation, with a lasting effect up to 40 days after. Countries with lower than average pre-intervention uptake had a more pronounced increase. In France, doses exceeded 25,895 vaccines per million capita (pmc) or in absolute terms, 1,749,589 doses prior to certification and 11,434 pmc after (772,563 doses). There was no effect in countries with higher uptake (Germany) or when introduced during limited supply (Denmark). There was higher uptake for <20 years and 20-29 years. Access restrictions linked to certain settings (nightclubs, events >1,000) were associated with higher uptake <20 years. When extended to broader settings, uptake remained high in the youngest group, but also observed in older age groups. The relationship of the intervention with reported infections was difficult to assess based on available data. Interpretation. We provide the first empirical assessment of the relationship between COVID-19 certification and vaccine uptake. Interpretation should recognise additional factors, including age eligibility changes and pandemic trajectories. We provide evidence that certification could increase vaccine uptake.

In some patients, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA has been detected in platelets. Together, this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with platelets. However, controversy remains on which receptors mediate SARS-CoV-2 platelet interactions. Most, but not all, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses fail to observe the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2, or the cellular serine protease necessary for viral entry, TMPRSS2, on platelets and megakaryocytes.

The aim of this study was to provide detailed maps of changes in sacral bone density across a series of patients using opportunistic quantitative computed tomography. We hypothesized that there would be significant differences in local cortical and trabecular bone density associated with age and sex. Fifty-four three-dimensional sacral models were segmented from routine clinical computed tomography scans, and detailed bone density estimates were derived for each bone using a calibrated opportunistic quantitative CT approach. The effects of age and sex on cortical and trabecular bone density were determined across the sample. Overall cortical bone loss averaged 2.1 mg/cc and 0.9 mg/cc per year, and trabecular bone loss was 1.6 mg/cc and 0.7 mg/cc for female and males respectively. Several regions had loss rates several times greater. Areas that were significantly affected by age included the vertebral bodies, bilateral ala, apex, and areas adjacent to both the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. Areas that were significantly affected by sex were the anterior sacral promontory, aspects of the ala. Bone density distribution across the sacrum changes non-uniformly due to factors including sex and age. Despite these overall trends, there remains significant variability between individuals.

This ij loop plays a role in the cholesterol dependence of membrane fusion and is specifically susceptible to proteolysis in the protease-resistant E1 homotrimer. The SFV ij loop contains a histidine residue at position 230. Sequence comparisons revealed that an analogous histidine is completely conserved in all alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins. An E1 H230A mutant was constructed using the SFV infectious clone. Although cells infected with H230A RNA produced virus particles, these virions were completely noninfectious and were blocked in both cell-cell fusion and lipid mixing assays. The H230A virions efficiently bound to cell surface receptors and responded to low pH by undergoing acid-dependent conformational changes including dissociation of the E1/E2 dimer, exposure of the fusion loop, association with target liposomes, exposure of acid-conformation-specific epitopes, and formation of the stable E1 homotrimer. Studies with a soluble fragment of E1 showed that the mutant protein was defective in lipid-dependent conformational changes.

Moreover, the flow cytometry study and survival rate analysis revealed that the csa3a deletion strain was more sensitive to the DNA-damaging reagent. Importantly, CRISPR self-targeting and DNA transfer experiments revealed that Csa3a was involved in regulating Ups- and Ced-mediated repair of CRISPR-damaged host genomic DNA. These results explain the interplay between Csa3a functions in activating CRISPR adaptation and DNA repair systems, and expands our understanding of the lost link between CRISPR self-immunity and genome stability.","output":"A CRISPR-associated factor Csa3a regulates DNA damage repair in Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) causes severe and economically significant disease in almost all birds. However, factors that affect NDV replication in host cells are poorly understood. NDV generates long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules during transcription of single-stranded genomic RNA. Protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by dsRNA. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of PKR in NDV infection. RESULTS: NDV infection led to the activation of dsRNA-dependent PKR and phosphorylation of its substrate, translation initiation factor eIF2, in a dose-dependent manner by either the lentogenic strain LaSota or a velogenic strain Herts/33. PKR activation coincided with the accumulation of dsRNA induced by NDV infection. PKR knockdown remarkably decreased eIF2 phosphorylation as well as IFN- mRNA levels, leading to the augmentation of extracellular virus titer. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown or phosphorylation of eIF2 or okadaic acid treatment significantly impaired NDV replication, indicating the critical role of the PKR/eIF2 signaling cascade in NDV infection. CONCLUSION: PKR is activated by dsRNA generated by NDV infection and inhibits NDV replication by eIF2 phosphorylation. This study provides insight into NDV-host interactions for the development of candidate antiviral strategies.","output":"Activation of the PKR/eIF2 signaling cascade inhibits replication of Newcastle disease virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to present a brief historical analysis of the Australian mining industry and the development of its social licence to operate. Commencing with the discovery of coal in the 18th century, to gold and copper and base metals in the 19th century, to the world class iron ore, mineral sands and diamond mines of the 20th century to the current day, the paper will attempt to determine how and why an industry, formerly well-respected by the public, is considered to be a pariah in the eyes of many sections of society. The theory of social licence and its use in the Australian minerals industry is briefly described and a working definition of \\"an honest, transparent engagement resulting in a beneficial outcome to all parties before, during and after mining\\" is adopted throughout the paper. Case studies illustrating examples where mining operations were, and continue to be sustained for decades, provide clear evidence of having a social licence to operate. On the other hand, examples are provided illustrating where poor environmental management practices, tailings dam failures, disputes with landowners, and/or government intervention have resulted in the loss of the social licence and early, unplanned closure. The paradox is that despite the industry's acknowledged contribution to the Australian economy, particularly in times of global ructions such as the GFC and the current coronavirus pandemic, there is considerable antipathy towards the industry by the public. Furthermore, the Australian mining industry's approach to environmental management and sustainable development is regularly used as a model for emerging mining economies. The industry has pioneered remediation and rehabilitation on challenging sites, including prime agricultural land, forests, riverine and beach environments. Successes are rarely acknowledged however but failures are highlighted, by the media, opponents of the industry, and governments. Clearly, the business as usual approach is not enough. Mining industry leaders need to take strong measures to ensure the industry is sustainable and maintains its social licence including eliminating all fatalities and serious injuries, ensuring the safety and stability of tailings storage facilities, accelerating progressive rehabilitation particularly on open cut coal mines, successfully closing mines, and lifting the environmental performance of all mines, not just a few.","output":"The devolution of the social licence to operate in the Australian mining industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few studies have examined the effects of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions on the shift in human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) season in Japan. This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014-2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient -0.02; P<0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient -0.30; P<0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient -0.18; P<0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","output":"Shifts in the epidemic season of human respiratory syncytial virus associated with inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions in Japan, 2014-2017: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repeating the BinaxNOW antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 by two groups of readers within 30 minutes resulted in high concordance (98.9%) in 2,110 encounters.

The present study aimed to evaluate the improvement of cardiac and endothelial functions of XFZYD for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Six databases were searched to collect RCTs related to the treatment of XFZYD for ACS. The primary outcomes were cardiac and endothelial functions, including the levels of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) in echocardiography, as well as the changes in the levels of nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the serum. The secondary outcomes were the blood levels of oxidative damage markers (including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), C-reactive protein (CRP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as well as the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Weighted mean difference (WMD) was estimated for all the outcomes with the random effects model. This type of analysis was conducted in the subgroups of the ACS subtypes, and the methodological quality was assessed using the handbook of Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: A total of 1,658 records were identified, and 16 randomized controlled trials (1,171 patients) were included. The primary outcomes suggested that XFZYD combined with routine treatment improved LVEF, reduced LVEDD and LVESD, and also improved the serum levels of NO, and reduced the levels of ET-1 and ICAM-1. XFZYD combination therapy significantly ameliorated the blood levels of SOD, MDA, BNP, CK-MB, and cTnI. However, the results indicated no significant difference between XFZYD plus routine treatment and routine treatment for the levels of VCAM-1 and CRP. Moreover, all the ADRs reported in the included studies were slight and the patients recovered soon. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that XFZYD may improve the cardiac and endothelial functions of ACS patients without serious ADRs. However, based on the mediocre methodological quality, the aforementioned conclusion should be confirmed in a multicenter, large-scale, and accurately designed clinical trial.","output":"The Improvement of Cardiac and Endothelial Functions of Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu Decoction for Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans are capable of solving cooperation problems following social norms. Social norms dictate appropriate behaviour and judgement on others in response to their previous actions and reputation. Recently, the so-called leading eight norms have been identified from many potential social norms that can sustain cooperation through a reputation-based indirect reciprocity mechanism. Despite indirect reciprocity being claimed to extend direct reciprocity in larger populations where direct experiences cannot be accumulated, the success of social norms have been analysed in models with global information and evolution. This study is the first to analyse the leading eight norms with local information and evolution. We find that the leading eight are robust against selfish players within most scenarios and can maintain a high level of cooperation also with local information and evolution. In fact, local evolution sustains cooperation under a wider set of conditions than global evolution, while local reputation does not hinder cooperation compared to global reputation. Four of the leading eight norms that do not reward justified defection offer better chances for cooperation with quick evolution, reputation with noise, larger networks, and when unconditional defectors enter the population.","output":"Local reputation, local selection, and the leading eight norms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Lifestyle interventions are effective in diabetes management, with smartphone apps that manage health data and dietary and exercise schedules gaining popularity. However, limited evidence from randomized clinical trials exists regarding the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a culturally contextualized smartphone-based intervention with usual care on weight and metabolic outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial conducted at multiple primary care centers in Singapore included 305 adults with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) of 23 or greater who had literacy in English and smartphone access. Participants were recruited between October 3, 2017, and September 9, 2019, and were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by gender, age, and BMI) to intervention (99 participants) or control (105 participants) groups. Participants data were analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Both control and intervention participants received diet and physical activity advice from a dietitian at a baseline face-to-face visit. Intervention participants additionally used a smartphone app to track weight, diet, physical activity, and blood glucose and then communicated with dietitians for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in body weight, while secondary outcomes were changes in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and diet. Post hoc analyses included glycemic changes in the subgroup with HbA(1c) levels of 8% or greater and diabetes medication changes. RESULTS: Among the 204 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [9.7] years; 132 [64.7%] men), baseline mean (SD) BMI was 30.6 (4.3). Compared with the control group, intervention participants achieved significantly greater reductions in weight (mean [SD] change, ?3.6 [4.7] kg vs ?1.2 [3.6] kg) and HbA(1c) levels (mean [SD] change, ?0.7% [1.2] vs ?0.3% [1.0]), with a greater proportion having a reduction in diabetes medications (17 participants [23.3%] vs 4 participants [5.4%]) at 6 months. The intervention led to a greater HbA(1c) reduction among participants with HbA(1c) levels of 8% or higher (mean [SD] change, ?1.8% [1.4] vs ?1.0% [1.4]; P = .001). Intergroup differences favoring the intervention were also noted for fasting blood glucose, diastolic blood pressure, and dietary changes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention was more effective in achieving weight and glycemic reductions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care, supporting the use of apps in lifestyle intervention delivery.

The present study explored the role of IGF-1R in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the possibility of IGF-1R silencing by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as a therapeutic target for HCC. We showed that IGF-1R mRNA was up-regulated in Huh7 and Hep3B cells and human HCC tissues, and that IGF-1R knockdown by RNAi led to decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased migration and invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Further, the in vivo study indicated that IGF-1R knockdown markedly diminished the tumorigenesis and metastasis of Huh7 xenograft. Moreover, the intratumoral administration of lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA led to significant tumor growth inhibition in an established Huh7 xenograft model. Mechanistic investigations showed that midkine was found to be the most significantly down-regulated protein in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R knockdown, and ectopic overexpression of midkine significantly rescued inhibition of Huh7 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion caused by IGF-1R suppression. Collectively, these data suggest that IGF-1R inhibition by RNAi can significantly suppress HCC growth and invasion at least partially through down-regulating midkine expression, and IGF-1R is a potential target for HCC gene therapy.","output":"Lentivirus-mediated RNAi knockdown of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibits the growth and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma via down-regulating midkine expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genome is an RNA virus consisting of approximately 30,000 bases.

RESULTS The moisture distribution, recrystallization and thermal properties of BWNs during refrigerated or ambient temperature storage were determined. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that KGM addition induced left-shifts of T21 and T22 values, indicating that KGM limited the mobility of bound and immobile water among noodle matrices. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that KGM did not change the crystal patterns of BWNs but could inhibit the starch recrystallization after refrigerated storage. The Tp and H values of retrograded samples notably (p<0.05) decreased with the increase of KGM addition, suggesting the hinderance of starch retrogradation behavior by KGM. The shelf life of BWNs was predicted by accelerated storage test combined with Arrhenius Equation.

We have previously shown that face-mask sampling (FMS) can detect exhaled tubercle bacilli and have adapted its use to quantify exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients admitted to hospital with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Between May and December 2020, we took two concomitant FMS and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) over two days, starting within 24 h of a routine virus positive NPS in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK. Participants were asked to wear a modified duckbilled facemask for 30 min, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, as well as International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) mortality and deterioration scores were obtained. Exposed masks were processed by removal, dissolution and analysis of sampling matrix strips fixed within the mask by RT-qPCR. Viral genome copy numbers were determined and results classified as Negative; Low: &#8804;999 copies; Medium: 1000-99,999 copies and High &#8805; 100,000 copies per strip for FMS or per 100a?l for NPS. RESULTS: 102 FMS and NPS were collected from 66 routinely positive patients; median age: 61 (IQR 49 - 77), of which FMS was positive in 38% of individuals and concomitant NPS was positive in 50%. Positive FMS viral loads varied over five orders of magnitude (<10-3.3 x 106 genome copies/strip); 21 (32%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. High FMS viral load was associated with respiratory symptoms at time of sampling and shorter interval between sampling and symptom onset (FMS High: median (IQR) 2 days (2-3) vs FMS Negative: 7 days (7-10), pa?=a?0.002). On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher FMS viral loads were associated with higher ISARIC mortality (Medium FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 15.7, 95% CI 3.7-27.7, pa?=a?0.01) and deterioration scores (High FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 37.6, 95% CI 14.0 to 61.3, pa?=a?0.002), while NPS viral loads showed no significant association. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a simple and effective method for detecting and quantifying exhaled SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Higher FMS viral loads were more likely to be associated with developing severe disease compared to NPS viral loads. Similar to NPS, FMS viral load was highest in early disease and in those with active respiratory symptoms, highlighting the potential role of FMS in understanding infectivity.","output":"Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 quantified by face-mask sampling in hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis profoundly disguised the vulnerability of human societies and healthcare systems in the situation of a pandemic. In many instances, it became evident that the quick and safe reduction of viral load and spread is the foremost principle in the successful management of such a pandemic. However, it became also clear that many of the established routines in healthcare are not always sufficient to cope with the increased demand for decontamination procedures of items, healthcare products, and even infected tissues. For the last 25 years, the use of gas plasma technology has sparked a tremendous amount of literature on its decontaminating properties, especially for heat-labile targets, such as polymers and tissues, where chemical decontamination often is not appropriate. However, while the majority of earlier work focused on bacteria, only relatively few reports are available on the inactivation of viruses. We here aim to provide a perspective for the general audience of the chances and opportunities of gas plasma technology for supporting healthcare during viral pandemics such as the COVID-19 crisis. This includes possible real-world plasma applications, appropriate laboratory viral test systems, and critical points on the technical and safety requirements of gas plasmas for virus inactivation.","output":"Gas Plasma Technology-An Asset to Healthcare during Viral Pandemics Such as the COVID-19 Crisis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Surface expression of mutant proteins was evident by immunofluorescence analysis and surface biotinylation. Intracellularly retained S proteins only contained endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans, whereas mutant proteins that migrated to the plasma membrane acquired N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. Corresponding tyrosine residues are present in the cytoplasmic tails of the S proteins of other animal CoV but not in the tail portion of the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Changing the SEPV tetrapeptide in the cytoplasmic tail to YEPI resulted in intracellular retention of the S protein of SARS-CoV.

The most common adverse effect is pulmonary toxicity including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). As centers adopt more advanced treatment planning techniques for TBI, total marrow irradiation (TMI), or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) there is a greater need to understand treatment-related risks for IPS for patients treated with conventional TBI. However, definitions of IPS as well as risk factors for IPS remain poorly characterized. In this study, we perform a critical review to further evaluate the literature describing pulmonary outcomes after TBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of publications from 1960-2020 was undertaken in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Search terms included total body irradiation, whole body radiation, radiation pneumonias, interstitial pneumonia, and bone marrow transplantation. Demographic and treatment-related data was abstracted and evidence quality supporting risk factors for pulmonary toxicity was evaluated. RESULTS: Of an initial 119,686 publications, 118 met inclusion criteria. Forty-six (39%) studies included a definition for pulmonary toxicity. A grading scale was provided in 20 studies (17%). In 42% of studies the lungs were shielded to a set mean dose of 800cGy. Fourteen (12%) reported toxicity outcomes by patient age. Reported pulmonary toxicity ranged from 0-71% of patients treated with TBI, and IPS ranged from 1-60%. The most common risk factors for IPS were receipt of a TBI containing regimen, increasing dose rate, and lack of pulmonary shielding. Four studies found an increasing risk of pulmonary toxicity with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Definitions of IPS as well as demographic and treatment-related risk factors remain poorly characterized in the literature. We recommend routine adoption of the diagnostic workup and the definition of IPS proposed by the American Thoracic Society. Additional study is required to determine differences in clinical and treatment-related risk between pediatric and adult patients. Further study using 3D treatment planning is warranted to enhance dosimetric precision and correlation of dose volume histograms with toxicities.","output":"Pulmonary Toxicity After Total Body Irradiation C Critical Review of the Literature and Recommendations for Toxicity Reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism are common after stroke. In small trials of patients undergoing surgery, graduated compression stockings (GCS) reduce the risk of DVT. National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence. We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke. METHODS In this outcome-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK, Italy, and Australia. Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS (n=1256) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS (n=1262). A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7-10 days and, when practical, again at 25-30 days after enrolment. The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN28163533. FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 126 (10.0%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 (10.5%) allocated to avoid GCS, resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI -1.9% to 2.9%). Skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use (64 [5%] vs 16 [1%]; odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 2.40-7.27). INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke.

Myocardial injury and thrombo-embolism are known complications for those with severe forms of disease. The incidence and risk factors for these complications for those patients who are asymptomatic or with mild forms of COVID-19 is unknown. CASE SUMMARY: In this report we describe the case of a 35-year-old man with no past cardiac history who presented with chest pain and a high-sensitivity troponin level of 386 ng/L in the context of an unspecified mild viral illness 1 month previously. Diagnostic evaluation revealed a new cardiomyopathy, left ventricular thrombus, and mid right coronary artery thrombosis. The coronary thrombosis was treated with thrombectomy. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies returned positive. He initially did well post-procedure; however, prior to discharge, he developed a second arterial thrombo-embolism event, a middle cerebral artery stroke. He was treated with thrombectomy and remains hospitalized. DISCUSSION: Recognition that mild COVID-19 can be complicated by subsequent cardiac injury and/or coagulopathy is important. As more people recover from this viral illness and return to normal activity levels, discussion among cardiac experts has begun regarding screening for occult myocardial injury in those who plan to resume competitive athletic activity. This case highlights the need for investigation regarding (i) the duration of thrombophilia after recovery from illness; (ii) the population that should receive thromboprophylaxis; and (iii) the duration of thromboprophylaxis therapy for COVID-19.","output":"Coronary and cerebral thrombosis in a young patient after mild COVID-19 illness: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral proteases are indispensable for successful virion maturation, thus making them a prominent drug target. Their enzyme activity is tightly spatiotemporally regulated by expression in the precursor form with little or no activity, followed by activation via autoprocessing. These cleavage events are frequently triggered upon transportation to a specific compartment inside the host cell. Typically, precursor oligomerization or the presence of a co-factor is needed for activation. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms will allow ligands with non-canonical mechanisms of action to be designed, which would specifically modulate the initial irreversible steps of viral protease autoactivation. Binding sites exclusive to the precursor, including binding sites beyond the protease domain, can be exploited. Both inhibition and up-regulation of the proteolytic activity of viral proteases can be detrimental for the virus. All these possibilities are discussed using examples of medically relevant viruses including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, retroviruses, picornaviruses, caliciviruses, togaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses.","output":"Precursors of Viral Proteases as Distinct Drug Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management of patients with lung cancer continues to be challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the increased risk of complications in this subset of patients.

Dentistry has had to adjust to the new epidemic situation to not only bring relief to suffering patients but also to avoid becoming a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: A comprehensive, cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 6 and 16, 2020 among 875 Polish dental practitioners. The aim of the research was to assess dentists' attitudes and professional approaches resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 71.2% of dentists who responded to the questionnaire decided to suspend their clinical practice during that particular time. The main factors for this fact were the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the respondents' subjective perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 contraction and a general feeling of anxiety and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 situation. The authors observed a significant decrease in the number of patients admitted weekly in April 2020 (12.06; SD, 11.55) in comparison to that in the time before the state of pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020 (49.21; SD, 24.97). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the unpreparedness of the dental sector, both in national health and private settings, most of the Polish dentists decided to voluntarily suspend their clinical practice in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. The COVID-19 outbreak has revealed numerous shortcomings in the dental care system, especially regarding the insufficient coordination of health services related to the pandemic and lack of advanced PPE. This has led to an overwhelming feeling of fear, confusion and anxiety among dental professionals in Poland and a sudden decrease in the number of performed dental procedures.

For the first time, an Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude dramatically engulfed several countries in West Africa since December 2013. Major failures of implementing measures to prevent human-to-human transmissions are the main cause of this large-scale Ebola outbreak. After about one-week incubation period, the Ebola virus disease is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever leading to multiple hemorrhages and to widespread organ failure. Several bat species constitute the main reservoirs of Ebola viruses. Human contamination would occur either directly from bats, widely consumed by the local populations, or through animal species susceptible to Ebola infection, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Alongside this natural cycle, an epidemic cycle involving domestic animals living in villages such as dogs or pigs, is seriously suggested. Thus, according to the diversity of concerned animals and their clinical infection form, modalities of human contamination can be multiple and are still largely unknown. In this context, all efforts that could be made to unravel the mystery of the Ebola virus emergence in humans and clarify modalities of the virus transmission, would allow for predicting or for anticipating the future occurrence of epidemics.

Common triggers for diabetic ketoacidosis include infection, cardiovascular events, drug use, medication non-adherence, and new onset diabetes. Early evidence suggests a correlation between COVID-19 infection and DKA. Based on the limited data, it is unclear at this time if increases in DKA are triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, or secondary factors from the pandemic such as lack of access to care or acute stress. In this study, we examine trends in DKA prevalence among patients at an underserved urban public ED within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is a retrospective study using administrative report data of all ED encounters. Cases of DKA, found using top 5 ICD10 ED diagnoses, were identified from 2019 and 2020. COVID-19 infection was pulled from laboratory data and merged to create one data set. Poisson regression was utilized to compare incidence rates of DKA (1) between 2019 and 2020 and (2) among COVID positive and COVID negative patients with DKA for the year of 2020. Yearly trends were examined month by month. Results: There were 180,158 patient visits in 2019 and 138,012 in 2020. Compared to 2019, incidence rates of DKA increased by 23% in 2020 (95% CI 4% to 42%, p=0.017). Among all those tested for COVID in 2020 (n=25,867), patients with positive COVID-19 tests trended to higher DKA rate (37% higher (95% CI -6% to 81% increase, p=0.098) than patients with negative COVID-19 tests. The increase was most prominent from April 2020 onward, with the largest increase in December 2020, correlating with the COVID surge at our hospital. (Figure 1). In December 2019, 20 out of 14,324 visits (0.14%) were coded as DKA, while in December 2020, 37 out of 10,942 visits (0.34%) were coded DKA. In December 2020, 11 DKA cases were COVID-19 positive and 26 were COVID-19 negative. When excluding the 11 cases of DKA with positive COVID-19 tests, the rate of DKA in 12/2020 would be 0.24%. Conclusions: We found the incidence rate ratio of DKA in 2020 increased compared to 2019, with an almost doubling of DKA rates in the month of December, the peak months of our pandemic surge. Our findings suggest a correlation between COVID-19 positivity and DKA, but is limited by small numbers at a single site. There is also limited data to suggest secondary factors may also play a role in increased rates. When removing COVID positive DKA cases in December 2020, the prevalence that month continued to 0.10% higher than in December 2019. While small numbers prevent firm conclusions, itis possible factors outside of COVID infection are attributing to higher rates. Various studies have shown reduced access to care for conditions managed in ambulatory settings during the COVID pandemic. Given this, decreased access to care for medication refill and titration may also be contributing to the rise in DKA rates. As more data becomes available, further research is required to establish the role of access to care versus inflammation from COVID-19 infection in triggering DKA.

A machine learning-based method, termed Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction (IMSP), was developed to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved public health attention, and eight highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins.

The aim of our study was to use the official epidemiological data to forecast the epidemic curves (daily new cases) of the COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), then to compare and validate the predicted models with the observed data. METHODS: We used publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create a training dataset, then we employed RNNs with gated recurring units (Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM units) to create two prediction models. Our proposed approach considers an ensemble-based system, which is realized by interconnecting several neural networks. To achieve the appropriate diversity, we froze some network layers that control the way how the model parameters are updated. In addition, we could provide country-specific predictions by transfer learning, and with extra feature injections from governmental constraints, better predictions in the longer term are achieved. We have calculated the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to thoroughly compare our model predictions with the observed data. RESULTS: We reported the predicted curves for France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The result of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve are to be anticipated. Besides, the errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seem to be low. CONCLUSION: Our proposed model has shown satisfactory accuracy in predicting the new cases of COVID-19 in certain contexts. The influence of this pandemic is significant worldwide and has already impacted most life domains. Decision-makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI-based models are useful tools for forecasting epidemics as these models can be recalculated according to the newly observed data to get a more precise forecasting.","output":"Predicting the epidemic curve of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) using artificial intelligence: An application on the first and second waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a COVID-19 patient is an aerosol-generating procedure Guidelines for personal protective equipment (PPE) use and providing CPR to COVID-19 patients have been developed locally for the purpose of improving patient and HCW safety Medical simulation is used to educate HCWs We aimed to the determine the utility of COVID-19 CPR simulation in improving HCWs ability, confidence and knowledge in managing medical emergencies Methods: 108 HCWs participated in a standardised 1-h moderate-fidelity CPR simulation designed and delivered in the medical simulation laboratory at our tertiary metropolitan hospital in Sydney, Australia Participant-filled surveys were collected pre and post-simulation Data was categorised into assessment of perceived knowledge, confidence and ability in PPE use and providing CPR using a 5-point Likert scale Statistical analyses were performed using the MannCWhitney U test Results: Of 108 participants, 94 were doctors and 14 nurses The mean subjective scores of confidence in providing CPR pre and post-simulation were 2 3 and 3 9 respectively (p &lt; 0 001);perceived ability to provide CPR pre and post-simulation were 2 5 and 4 0 respectively (p &lt; 0 001);confidence in PPE use pre and post-simulation were 3 1 and 4 2 respectively (p &lt; 0 001);perceived ability in PPE use pre and post-simulation were 3 3 and 4 2 respectively (p &lt; 0 001) (see Fig 1) Adequate knowledge of specific elements of newly developed guidelines improved from 14% to 97% of participants pre and post-simulation Conclusion: Our study shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, simulation of medical emergency scenarios is a valuable tool in improving knowledge, confidence and perceived ability of HCWs in PPE use and providing CPR in medical emergencies where real-life experience may be limited Inadequate preparation before encountering real-life scenarios in COVID-19 patients may compromise the safety of both patients and healthcare workers","output":"The utility of simulation in preparing the healthcare workforce for providing CPR during medical emergencies in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hook-up apps are an increasingly popular way for women to meet other people for sex, dating, relationships, and more.

Methods: This long-term study was carried out in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from July 2020 to July 2021. After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 1000 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged. The participants were followed up after 30 and 90 days. Results: At the time of enrollment, there were 602 (60.2%) males and 398 (39.8%) females. The most common neurological symptom on 30-day follow-up was headache (8.8%), followed by insomnia. The most common neurological symptom on day 90 follow-up was insomnia (5.07%), followed by an altered sense of smell (3.3%). Conclusion: COVID-19 tends to produce a wide range of neurological symptoms, ranging from headache to anosmia to increased risk of stroke, that complicates clinical management. Potential neurologic effects and drug interactions have been reported secondary to the medications used to treat COVID-19. In light of the aforementioned facts, COVID-19 could potentially have a long-term effect on the brain.

The collection, processing, and analysis of data is critical in providing a useful response-especially as information of fundamental importance to such decision making (base rates and transmission rates) is lacking. We propose that scarce testing resources should be diverted away from confirmatory analysis of symptomatic people, as laboratory diagnosis appears to have little decision value in treatment choice over clinical diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms. In contrast, the exploratory use of testing resources to reduce ambiguity in estimates of the base rate of infection appears to have significant value and great practical import for public policy purposes.

The use of data-driven models enables clinicians to accurately interpret potential information, examine the progression of CD4 count, and deal with patient heterogeneity due to patient-specific effects. Quantile-based regression models can be used to illustrate the entire conditional distribution of an outcome and identify various covariates effects at the respective location. METHODS: This study uses the quantile mixed-effects model that assumes an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the error term. The model also incorporated multiple random effects to consider the correlation among observations. The exact maximum likelihood estimation was implemented using the Stochastic Approximation of the ExpectationCMaximization algorithm to estimate the parameters. This study used the Centre of the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 002 Acute Infection Study data. In this study, the response variable is the longitudinal CD4 count from HIV-infected patients who were initiated on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), and the explanatory variables are relevant baseline characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: The analysis obtained robust parameters estimates at various locations of the conditional distribution. For instance, our result showed that baseline BMI (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text] ), baseline viral load (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] ), and post-HAART initiation (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text] ) were major significant factors of CD4 count across fitted quantiles. CONCLUSIONS: CD4 cell recovery in response to post-HAART initiation across all fitted quantile levels was observed. Compared to HIV-infected patients with low viral load levels at baseline, HIV-infected patients enrolled in the treatment with a high viral load level at baseline showed a significant negative effect on CD4 cell counts at upper quantiles. HIV-infected patients registered with high BMI at baseline had improved CD4 cell count after treatment, but physicians should not ignore this group of patients clinically. It is also crucial for physicians to closely monitor patients with a low BMI before and after starting HAART.

In this study, the delivery of health services is investigated both before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at public hospitals in Yemen to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the utilisation of health services. METHOD: Data collected from 127 hospitals in Yemen were reviewed using the DHIS2 system. The data represented 3 months before the outbreak of COVID-19 between January and March 2020 and during the outbreak of COVID-19 outbreak between April and June 2020. The results were then compared with the same period in 2019. The utilisation pattern of healthcare services during the period of investigation was compiled and analysed by applying a generalised estimating equation (GEE) to examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen. The data collected from the targeted hospitals included information related to consultations, surgeries, deliveries, C-sections and penta-3rd dose immunisation. RESULTS: The trendline of health services used during the pandemic showed a gradual decline beginning from April 2020 for consultations, surgeries and penta-3rd dose utilisation. The GEE model revealed a significant effect (p<0.05) during the outbreak compared with preoutbreak in the consultation services (B=?1,343.9; 95% CI ?1,767.2 to ?920.6; (2)=38.718), surgeries (B=?54.98; 95% CI ?79.13 to ?30.83, (2)=19.911) and penta-3rd dose (B=?24.47; 95% CI ?30.56 to ?18.38 and (2)=62.010).

We trained an RL prescription algorithm that recommends a treatment regimen optimizing patients cumulative health outcomes using their individual characteristics and medical history at each encounter. The RL recommendations were evaluated on an independent subset of patients. RESULTS: The single-outcome optimization RL algorithms, RLCglycemia, RLCblood pressure, and RLCCVD, recommended consistent prescriptions as that observed by clinicians in 86.1%, 82.9%, and 98.4% of the encounters, respectively. For patient encounters in which the RL recommendations differed from the clinician prescriptions, significantly fewer encounters showed uncontrolled glycemia (A1c > 8% in 35% of encounters), uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 140 mmHg in 16% of encounters), and high CVD risk (risk > 20% in 25% of encounters) under RL algorithms compared with those observed under clinicians (43%, 27%, and 31% of encounters, respectively; all p < 0.001).

However, most evaluations of antigen tests have been performed before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Thus, an assessment of the diagnostic performance of antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the circulation of Omicron variant is required. Methods: This prospective observational study evaluated QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a rapid antigen detection test between December 2021 and February 2022 in Japan, using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as a reference. Two nasopharyngeal samples were simultaneously collected for antigen testing and for RT-PCR. Variant analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was also performed. Results: In total, nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 1,073 participants (417 positive; 919 symptomatic; 154 asymptomatic) for analysis. Compared with those of RT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.2% (95% CI: 91.6%-96.3%), 99.5% (95% CI: 98.7%-99.9%), 99.2% (95% CI: 97.8%-99.8%), and 96.5% (95% CI: 94.8%-97.7%), respectively. The sensitivity among symptomatic individuals was 94.3% (95% CI: 91.5%-96.4%). Overall, 85.9% of sequences were classified as Omicron sublineage BA.1, 12.4% were Omicron sublineage BA.2, and 1.6% were Delta B.1.617.2. (Delta variant). Most of the samples (87.1%) had Ct values <25.

We examined exhaled air dispersion during HFNC therapy versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on a human patient simulator (HPS) in an isolation room with 16 air changesh-1. METHODS The HPS was programmed to represent different severity of lung injury. CPAP was delivered at 5-20 cmH2O via nasal pillows (Respironics Nuance Pro Gel or ResMed Swift FX) or an oronasal mask (ResMed Quattro Air). HFNC, humidified to 37C, was delivered at 10-60 Lmin-1 to the HPS. Exhaled airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualisation and revealed by laser light-sheet. Normalised exhaled air concentration was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. Significant exposure was defined when there was 20% normalised smoke concentration. RESULTS In the normal lung condition, meansd exhaled air dispersion, along the sagittal plane, increased from 18634 to 26427 mm and from 20711 to 33234 mm when CPAP was increased from 5 to 20 cmH2O via Respironics and ResMed nasal pillows, respectively. Leakage from the oronasal mask was negligible. Meansd exhaled air distances increased from 6515 to 17233 mm when HFNC was increased from 10 to 60 Lmin-1. Air leakage to 620 mm occurred laterally when HFNC and the interface tube became loose.

Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires a coordinated effort through engaging public and service providers in preventive measures. The government of Ethiopia had already announced prevention guidelines for the public. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based data on the public knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and response of the service providers regarding COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the public KAP and service providers' preparedness towards the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from late March to the first week of April 2020. Participants were conveniently sampled from 10 different city sites. Data collection was performed using a self-administered questionnaire and observational assessment using a checklist. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient and chi-square tests were performed. RESULT: A total of 839 public participants and 420 service providers enrolled in the study. The mean age was 30.30 (range = 18-72) years. The majority of the respondents (58.6%) had moderate knowledge about COVID-19, whereas 37.2% had good knowledge. Moreover, 60.7% and 59.8% of the participants had a positive attitude towards preventive measures and good practice to mitigate the pandemic, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitude, whereas the correlations between knowledge and practice and attitude and practice were weak. With regard to service providers' preparedness, 70% have made hand-washing facilities available. A large majority of the respondents (84.4%) were using government-owned media followed by social media (46.0%) as a main source of information. CONCLUSION: The public in Addis Ababa had moderate knowledge, an optimistic attitude and descent practice. The information flow from government and social media seemed successful seeing the majority of the respondents identifying preventive measures, signs and symptoms and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge and attitude was not associated with practice, thus, additional innovative strategies for practice changes are needed. Two thirds of the service provider made available hand washing facilities which seems a first positive step. However, periodic evaluation of the public KAP and assessment of service providers' preparedness is mandatory to combat the pandemic effectively.","output":"COVID-19 and the public response: Knowledge, attitude and practice of the public in mitigating the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, SiO(2) nanoparticles surface coated with Ag nanoparticles (SA particles) were fabricated to coat a medium air filter. The pressure drop, filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter were evaluated against aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 in a continuous air flow condition. A mathematical approach was developed to measure the anti-viral ability of the filter with various virus deposition times. Moreover, two quality factors based on the anti-viral ability of the filter, and a traditional quality factor based on filtration efficiency, were calculated. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop increased with decreasing media velocity and with increasing SA particle coating level. The anti-viral efficiency also increased with increasing SA particle coating level, and decreased by with increasing virus deposition time. Consequently, SA particle coating on a filter does not have significant effects on filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating level to produce the highest anti-viral quality.","output":"Fabrication of an anti-viral air filter with SiO(2)CAg nanoparticles and performance evaluation in a continuous airflow condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last decades, organoselenium compounds gained interest due to their important biological features.

As an application of this model, we perform a case study for Hamilton County, the fourth-most populous county in the US state of Tennessee and a region with high prevalence of chronic conditions. Our data fitting and simulation results quantify the high risk of COVID-19 for the population group with underlying health conditions.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a preregistered study using an online U.S. sample we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p=.016, n=117) and standing closer to others while outside (p<.001, n=114). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Reduced social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has already had serious worldwide health, socio-economic, political, and educational consequences. In the present study, we investigated what factors can motivate young adults to comply with the recommended preventive measures against coronavirus infection. Even though young people are less likely to suffer severe medical consequences from the virus, they can still transmit it to more vulnerable individuals. Surprisingly, we found no significant effects of previously successful experimental manipulations (e.g., enhancing self-efficacy, and visual aids) that aimed to improve risk understanding and impact COVID-19 related behavioral intentions. Instead, intentions toward preventive behaviors were predicted by self-reported worry, perceived controllability of the pandemic, and risk perception. Interestingly, worry about health, and worry about restricting personal freedom predicted behavioral intentions in diverging directions. In particular, participants who were worried about health, were more willing to obey strict hygiene and social distancing restrictions. In contrast, participants who were worried about personal restrictions, were less ready to adopt these preventive actions.","output":"Worry, Risk Perception, and Controllability Predict Intentions Toward COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on understanding and explaining the technologies that affect the governance of the risk of Covid-19 in Turkey. To assess how this risk is governed by individuals, the study focuses on discussions around this disease within a Turkish Facebook group. The aim is to understand how individuals conduct themselves and establish norms of conduct against the risk of illness that, in this case of an infectious disease, involves governing the self while managing others. The results show that the discourse created around the governance of infection risk is very much in line with notions of neoliberal governmentality, individual responsibility, citizens as consumers, and individuals as entrepreneurs. Governing the risk of Covid-19 is related to prevalent ways of prioritising or recognising economic explanations, and cost calculation and assessment of successful governance using quantifiable variables, such as the number of new cases and deaths. Concepts like herd immunity and natural selection are open to discussion. Individuals who believe that the government is primarily responsible for risk governance assert that they are paying taxes and advocate that, disciplinary measures should be taken by the government, whereas the opposing view states that individuals are responsible for the governance of Covid-19 risk. We interpret both these opposing views as illustrating neoliberal governmentality and representing contractual and familial stateCcitizen relationships.

Recent methods attempting to address this issue while respecting the ordinal structure of the labels have resorted to converting ordinal regression into a series of extended binary classification subtasks. However, the adoption of such methods remains inconsistent due to theoretical and practical limitations. Here we address these limitations by demonstrating that the subtask probabilities form a Markov chain. We show how to straightforwardly modify neural network architectures to exploit this fact and thereby constrain predictions to be universally rank consistent. We furthermore prove that all rank consistent solutions can be represented within this formulation. Using diverse benchmarks and the real-world application of a specialized recurrent neural network for COVID-19 prognosis, we demonstrate the practical superiority of this method versus the current state-of-the-art. The method is open sourced as user-friendly PyTorch and TensorFlow packages.","output":"Universally Rank Consistent Ordinal Regression in Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: POD Adventures is a gamified mental health intervention delivered via a smartphone app and supported by counsellors for a target population of secondary school students in India. This paper describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial of a remotely delivered version of the intervention in the context of COVID-19 restrictions. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives are to assess the feasibility of research procedures and intervention delivery and to generate preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of the intervention to inform the sample size calculation of a full-scale trial. METHODS: We will conduct a parallel, 2-arm, individually randomized pilot controlled trial in 11 secondary schools in Goa, India. This pilot trial aims to recruit 70 participants with a felt need for psychological support. Participants will receive either the POD Adventures intervention delivered over 4 weeks or usual care comprising information about local mental health services and national helplines. Outcomes will be assessed at two timepoints: baseline and 6 weeks post randomization. RESULTS: The first participant was enrolled on January 28, 2021, and 6-week assessment completed on April 4, 2021. Owing to a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, schools in Goa were closed on April 22, 2021. Trial participants are currently receiving the intervention or completing follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will help understand the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a remotely delivered digital mental health intervention in a low-resource setting.

Here, we summarise details of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to assist understanding of the emergence, evolution and diagnosis of this deadly new virus. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on high similarities in the genome sequences, the virus is thought to have arisen from SARS-like CoVs in bats but the lack of an intermediate species containing a CoV with even greater similarity has so far eluded discovery. The critical determinant of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the spike (S) gene encoding the viral structural protein that interacts with the host cell entry receptor ACE2. The S protein is sufficiently adapted to bind human ACE2 much more readily than SARS-CoV, the most closely related human CoV. SUMMARY: Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is undergoing subtle evolution in humans through mutation that may enhance transmission, there is limited evidence for attenuation that might weaken the virus. It is also still unclear as to the events that led to the virus emergence from bats. Importantly, current diagnosis requires specific recognition and amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome by qPCR, despite these ongoing viral genome changes. Alternative diagnostic procedures relying on immunoassay are becoming more prevalent.","output":"Decoding Covid-19 with the SARS-CoV-2 Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about kidney transplant recipients are rising. However, the incidence, clinical course, outcome, and predictive factors of disease severity are obscured. METHODS: We describe clinical and laboratory manifestations, radiologic findings, clinical course, and finally outcome of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 2493 kidney transplant recipients under follow-up in our clinic, 19 cases (4 cases diagnosed based on radiologic findings) were admitted. The mean age of patients was 47.6  12.4 years, and the mean time from transplantation was 115.6  70.3 months. Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were 84.2% and 78.9%, respectively. Nine patients did not survive the hospital course. History of acute rejection during the past 12 months, diabetes, higher N/L ratio, lower platelet count, elevated N/L x CRP, higher levels of LDH, positive D-dimer, higher troponin, and prolonged PT were associated with mortality. Among patients with positive COVID-19 test, history of acute rejection, low platelet count, and positive D-dimer were associated with poor outcome. Treatment with cyclosporine was associated with better clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Low rate of admission in transplant recipients specially in the very first years of transplantation might be due to protective effects of immunosuppressive agents against cytokine storm or modification of immunity function. We suggest evaluation of T-cell number, function, and cytokine profile as a guide to manage COVID-19 mainly in patients with higher risk of mortality.","output":"Low rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients-A battle between infection and immune response?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antiviral activity of the drug Kagocel?, which has a high safety profile and proven efficacy for the prevention and treatment of influenza and AVRI as an interferon inducer, was studied against a new pandemic strain of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in Vero C1008 cell culture The results of the study revealed that at the addition of the substance Kagocel? at the concentration of 5000 mg/ml into the cell culture 1 h before the virus infection and 1 h after, there was 100% inhibition of the cytopathic activity of the virus It was also found that Kagocel? at the dose of 5000 mg/ml effectively suppressed the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, variant B, in Vero C1008 cell culture by 1 75 lg, the inhibition coefficient was 97 83 % ٧֧ߧ ڧӧӧڧߧѧ ѧܧڧӧߧ ݧ֧ܧѧӧ֧ߧߧԧ ֧ѧѧ ѧԧ֧?, ڧާ֧֧ԧ ӧܧڧ ڧݧ ҧ֧٧ѧߧ  էܧѧ٧ѧߧߧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ էݧ ڧݧѧܧڧܧ  ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ԧڧ    ܧѧ֧ӧ ڧߧէܧ ڧߧ֧֧ߧ,  ߧ֧ߧڧ ߧӧԧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ֧ܧԧ ѧާާ SARS-CoV-2  ܧ֧ڧާ֧ߧѧ in vitro  ܧݧ ܧݧ֧ Vero C1008 ֧٧ݧѧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ӧӧڧݧ,   ӧߧ֧֧ߧڧ ҧѧߧڧ ѧԧ֧?  ܧݧ ܧݧ֧ ٧ 1  է ڧߧڧڧӧѧߧڧ  ֧֧ 1  ݧ  ܧߧ֧ߧѧڧ 5000 ާܧ/ާ ާ֧ѧݧ էѧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ڧѧڧ֧ܧ ѧܧڧӧߧ ӧڧ ߧ 100% ѧܧا ҧݧ ѧߧӧݧ֧ߧ,  ѧԧ֧? ֧ܧڧӧߧ էѧӧݧ֧ ֧էܧڧ ӧڧ SARS-CoV-2, ӧѧڧѧߧ ,  ܧݧ ܧݧ֧ Vero C1008  է٧ 5000 ާܧ/ާ ߧ 1,75 lg,   ܧڧڧ֧ߧ ڧߧԧڧҧڧӧѧߧڧ  էѧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ֧էܧڧ ӧڧ ѧӧڧ 97,83%","output":"Antiviral Activity of Kagocel? in vitro Against Virus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Comorbidities making up metabolic syndrome (MetS), such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and chronic cardiovascular disease can lead to increased risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) with a higher morbidity and mortality.

Here we aimed to investigate the distribution of global epidemic clones of carbapenemase-producing ExPEC from Argentina in representative clinical isolates recovered between July 2008 and March 2017. Carbapenemase-producing ExPEC (n = 160) were referred to the Argentinean reference laboratory. Of these, 71 were selected for genome sequencing. Phenotypic and microbiological studies confirmed the presence of carbapenemases confirmed as KPC-2 (n = 52), NDM-1 (n = 16), IMP-8 (n = 2), and VIM-1 (n = 1) producers. The isolates had been recovered mainly from urine, blood, and abdominal fluids among others, and some were from screening samples. After analyzing the virulence gene content, 76% of the isolates were considered ExPEC, although non-ExPEC isolates were also obtained from extraintestinal sites. Pan-genome phylogeny and clonal analysis showed great clonal diversity, although the first phylogroup in abundance was phylogroup A, harboring CC10 isolates, followed by phylogroup B2 with CC/ST131, mostly H30Rx, the subclone co-producing CTX-M-15.

This study analyzes the effects of non-supervised osteoporosis prevention programs on bone mineral density. Non-supervised exercise increases femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral density in adult women. Thus, it might be effective for preventing or treating osteoporosis or osteopenia in this population. INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a major health issue worldwide. Social distancing measures due to COVID-19 have hindered the chances to take part in supervised osteoporosis prevention exercise programs. The purpose of the present study is to systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of non-supervised osteoporosis prevention exercise programs on bone mineral density (BMD) in adult women. METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases (n = 7) was conducted including (a) prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing at least one exercise group vs. a control group with sedentary lifestyle or sham exercises; (b) baseline and follow-up BMD values, or BMD changes from baseline, at any skeletal site; (c) women over 30 years old; and (d) non-supervised exercise programs only. Subgroup analyses were performed for menopausal status, intervention duration, type of exercise, and osteopenia/osteoporosis status. RESULTS: Ten studies were included (n = 668). Random effect analyses showed that unsupervised exercise had beneficial effects on lumbar spine (LS) BMD with standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03C0.77), and femoral neck (FN) BMD with SMD = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.16C0.85). Unsupervised exercise increased LS (SMD = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.13C1.33)) and FN BMD (SMD = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.33C1.37)) in women with osteopenia/osteoporosis, but not in healthy counterparts. CONCLUSION: Non-supervised exercise improves FN and LS BMD in adult women. Beneficial effects of exercise on FN and LS BMD might be more pronounced in those with poor bone health compared with healthy counterparts. More RCTs prescribing non-supervised, osteogenic exercise are required in this population. It is necessary to investigate the efficacy of remote/assistive technologies for delivering and monitoring non-supervised exercise interventions.

As existing face recognizers and mask detectors have high performance in their respective tasks, it is significantly challenging to simultaneously fool them and preserve the transferability of the attack. We formulate the new task as the generation of realistic&adversarial-faced mask and make three main contributions: First, we study the naive Delanunay-based masking method (DM) to simulate the process of wearing a faced mask that is cropped from a template image, which reveals the main challenges of this new task. Second, we further equip the DM with the adversarial noise attack and propose the adversarial noise Delaunay-based masking method (AdvNoise-DM) that can fool the face recognition and mask detection effectively but make the face less natural. Third, we propose the adversarial filtering Delaunay-based masking method denoted as MF2M by employing the adversarial filtering for AdvNoise-DM and obtain more natural faces. With the above efforts, the final version not only leads to significant performance deterioration of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based FRS, but also remains undetected by the SOTA facial mask detector, thus successfully fooling both systems at the same time.","output":"Masked Faces with Faced Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early protection, early identification, early diagnosis, and early isolation are crucial to combat with Covid-19 outbreaks","output":"Strategies for the prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell or taste. Neurological complications include cerebrovascular incidents, acute polyneuropathy and myelitis. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the prevalence of chronic pain in COVID-19 patients. Methods: All participants were prospectively evaluated. Pain was assessed with the use of the painDETECT and the DN4 questionnaires. Results: Fifty-two COVID019 patients (67% females, mean age 48.4  16.1 years) and 52 age and gender matched healthy volunteers were recruited. Patients were evaluated on average 4.2  2.9 months after being diagnosed with COVID-19. From the classic acute COVID-19 symptoms, 50% had anosmia/hyposmia, 48% ageusia/hypogeusia, 48% fatigue, 40% cough, 39% headache, 35% myalgias and 31% fever. The prevalence of chronic pain was 70% in the COVID-19 group and 73% in the healthy volunteer group. The most commonly reported painful area in both groups was lower back (35% in the COVID-19 group and 31% in the healthy control group). In 7 patients chronic pain (6 neuropathic, 1 nociceptive) developed after COVID-19 whereas 3 patients reported worsening of their pre-existing chronic pain (2 neuropathic, 1 nociceptive). In the COVID-19 group, patients with pain were significantly older compared to patients without (51.8  17.0 years vs 40.9  10.7 years, p = 0.022). No differences between the two sub-groups were found regarding gender, BMI, COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms duration or interval since COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: Chronic pain is very prevalent in patients suffered from COVID-19 and its prevalence is similar to the prevalence observed in the general population. However, one in 5 COVID-19 patients reports that chronic pain developed or deteriorated after their infection. Chronic pain, particularly neuropathic, should be considered as a symptom of the post-COVID syndrome. ? 2021, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

Moreover, exercise seems to induce improvements in the bone turnover of osteopenic and osteoporotic subjects, increasing bone health. Incidence of osteoporosis increases in postmenopausal women due to hormonal factors that lead to an imbalance in bone remodeling. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic period induced general population to decrease the level of physical activity, increasing the incidence of several diseases, including osteoporosis. During this year, the use of technology has been applied to continue rehabilitation program, as well as the gym session, to reduce the sedentary level both in healthy population and in patients.

They also lose interest in activities, concentrating and appetite, they finally may attempt suicide. Depression is the second chronic disease, as a source of the global burden of disease, after heart disease. Its prevalence elevated seven times during the COVID-19. AIM: The current study was designed to evaluate camphor neuroprotective role against rats' ciprofloxacin-induced depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Depression was induced by administration of ciprofloxacin (50 mg/kg; orally) for 21 days. Wister albino male rats were divided into five groups. Group I (normal control): rats were given normal saline. Group II: rats received camphor (10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days. Group III (depression control): rats received ciprofloxacin only. Groups IV and V: rats received camphor (5 and 10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days concurrent with ciprofloxacin. Behavior tests as forced swimming test, activity cage, and rotarod were estimated. Oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) besides inflammatory biomarkers as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) as well as neurotransmitters were determined. Finally, histopathological examination was done.

This public health emergency was followed by a significant loss of human life; the ensuing social restrictions led to loss of employment, lack of interactions, and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making. This study exploited AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviors in global emergencies, which could lead to improved planning and policy making for future crises.","output":"Emotions of COVID-19: Content Analysis of Self-Reported Information Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ever since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO in late March 2020, more and more people began to share their opinions online about the anxiety, stress, and trauma they suffered because of the pandemic.

Demand on capacity, concerns for transplant recipients, including the risks of nosocomial infection, and the availability and safety of donors, lead to continuation of transplantation for only urgent and super-urgent, in-patient candidates, in the UK from March to May 2020. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of these practice changes on heart and lung donor utilisation during the pandemic period. Methods Data on all adult and paediatric heart and lung donors offered, and transplants performed, between 1 March and 30 September 2019 and 1 March and 30 September 2020 were obtained from the UK Transplant Registry. The early pandemic period is defined as 1 March to 31 May 2020. Ideal lung donors are defined as age <56 years and no smoking history. Results Lung transplant activity during the early pandemic period fell by 77% (13 transplants compared to 56 in 2019). Heart transplant activity fell by 10% (38 compared to 42 heart transplants in 2019). The number of donors, who donated at least 1 solid organ, fell by 51%. The lung donor utilisation rate during the early pandemic period was 11%, compared to 24% for the same period of 2019. The heart donor utilisation rate during the pandemic period was 35% compared to 26% during the same period of 2019. The proportion of ideal lung donors, from donors where lung(s) were offered, was 23% in 2020 compared to 24% in 2019. Following the early pandemic period (1 June to 30 September 2020), there has been an increase in the number of lung donors, lung transplant activity and utilisation, rising from 11% in March to May to 14% in June to September. This compares with a utilisation rate of 21% for the same period of 2019. Conclusion During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, changes to practice led to the continuation of heart transplantation, with minimal impact on activity, whilst lung transplant activity fell. The number of organ donors fell, while the quality of potential lung donors remained unchanged. As the evidence base guiding clinical practice is evolving, along with improved donor testing, lung transplant activity is again increasing, however the utilisation of donors remains lower than in 2019. On-going analysis of activity is required to fully assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the UK lung transplant population.","output":"Cardiothoracic Organ Utilisation during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While cyber security has become a prominent concept of emerging information governance, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been dealing with severe threats to individual and organizational IT systems for a long time.

The only case in which no improvements are possible is when one of the single forecasts is already the optimal one in terms of MSE. The kinds of combination methods are various, ranging from the simple average (SA) to more robust methods such as the one based on median or Trimmed Average (TA) or Least Absolute Deviations or optimization techniques (Stock and Watson in J Forecast 23(6):405C430, 2004). Standard regression-based combination approaches may fail to get a realistic result if the forecasts show high collinearity in several situations or the data distribution is not Gaussian. Therefore, we propose a forecast combination method based on Lp-norm estimators. These estimators are based on the Generalized Error Distribution, which is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution, and they can be used to solve the cases of multicollinearity and non-Gaussianity. In order to demonstrate the potential of Lp-norms, we conducted a simulated and an empirical study, comparing its performance with other standard-regression combination approaches.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to 23 March 2020 restrictions. To do that, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model which estimated unreported cases and infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by reporting biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that R0 was 2.43 (95%CI= 2.42 C2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic, and that 92.9% (95%CI= 92.5% - 93.1%) of total cases were not reported.

Using the lockdown in spring 2020 as a naturalistic context to study consumer responses to restrictions of choice freedom, results of an online study in Austria support these predictions. These findings advance a view of maximizers as lay existentialists, who view choice as a meaning-making device that is tightly linked to their sense of identity.

The responsible virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is mainly characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the disease can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which are mostly fatal for the patient. The severity of disease progression was hypothesized to be related to an overshooting immune response and was correlated with age and comorbidities, including cancer. A lot of research has lately been focused on the pathogenesis and acute consequences of COVID-19. However, the possibility of long-term consequences caused by viral infections which has been shown for other viruses are not to be neglected. In this regard, this opinion discusses the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer with special focus on the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage caused by infection. We summarize the available literature on COVID-19 suggesting an increased risk for severe disease progression in cancer patients, and we discuss the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to cancer development. We offer lines of thought to provide ideas for urgently needed studies on the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Cancer Patients Have a Higher Risk Regarding COVID-19Cand Vice Versa?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Testing of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may result in delayed detection of infection. Given the number of people affected in pandemic, it is important to use a test that gives faster results and can be used on large number of sample size to cope with the increased testing capacity. Rapid Antigen detection test fulfills both the criteria. Aims and Objectives: The study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen detection test compared to RT-PCR on the same patients in District Hospital. Materials and Methods: Subjects were tested by both Rapid antigen detection testing and RT-PCR in District Hospital. The present study compared RAT and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimen.756 Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2, Contacts of CoV2 patients, pre-operative patients in District Hospital. Results: Of 756 nasopharyngeal samples, 81 (10.71%) were positive and 675 (89.28%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test's sensitivity 55.04% and specificity was 99.2%, respectively. Positive predictive value 93.42%, Negative predictive value 91.47%, Diagnostic Accuracy 91.67%, Cohen's Kappa Coefficient 0.6482, 95% CI: 0.5801-0.7163. Conclusion: The rapid antigen detection test showed comparable sensitivity and specificity with RT-PCR assay. These results support the fact that RAT is an accurate alternative to RT-PCR in areas where there is increased testing burden, for screening of asymptomatic carriers, in areas that lack suitable laboratories to perform RT-PCR, in areas such as airport, train stations, and bus stands.

The main cause is smoking tobacco, but other factors have been identified. Several pathobiological processes interact on a complex background of genetic determinants, lung growth, and environmental stimuli. The disease is further aggravated by exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe disease, up to 78% of which are due to bacterial infections, viral infections, or both. Comorbidities include ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. Bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of treatment: 2 agonists and long-acting anticholinergic agents are frequently used (the former often with inhaled corticosteroids). Besides improving symptoms, these treatments are also thought to lead to some degree of disease modification. Future research should be directed towards the development of agents that notably affect the course of disease.","output":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We proposed a delay differential model, associated with the response time for individuals to the current infection, to examine the media impact on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.

As these characteristics easily lead to global pandemics, studying the evolutionary relationship between viruses is essential for clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing has played an important role in evolutionary analysis. Recent alignment-free methods can overcome the problems of traditional alignment-based methods, which consume both time and space. This paper proposes a novel alignment-free method called the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV), which defines a correlation measure of the L-step delay of a nucleotide location from its location in the original DNA sequence. The numerical feature is a 16  L-dimensional numerical vector describing the distribution characteristics of the nucleotide positions in a DNA sequence. The proposed L-step delay correlation measure is interestingly related to some types of L + 1 spaced mers. Unlike traditional gene comparison, our method avoids the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment, and hence improves the speed of sequence comparison. Our method is applied to evolutionary analysis of the common human viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Dengue virus, Hepatitis B virus, and human rhinovirus and achieves the same or even better results than alignment-based methods. Especially for SARS-CoV-2, our method also confirms that bats are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Alignment-free sequence comparison for virus genomes based on location correlation coefficient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global incidence of tuberculosis remains unacceptably high, with new preventative strategies needed to reduce the burden of disease.

We evaluated the effect of meditation and breathing exercises on the well-being of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection under institutional isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized control trial on 84 subjects, 18 years and above, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients under institutional isolation. Subjects were randomly and equally divided into a control group and interventional group. We measured the depression, anxiety, and stress levels as well as quality of sleep in patients after 7 days of meditation and breathing exercises in the intervention group versus standard care in the control group. RESULTS: Meditation and breathing exercises had a statistically significant effect on the depression level (P < 0.001), stress level (P = 0.004), and the quality of sleep [trouble falling asleep (P = 0.007), trouble staying asleep (P = 0.004), and feel tired after waking up in the morning (P = 0.003)].

A recent study suggested that treatment with autophagy inhibitors, in particular hydroxychloroquine, would be a potential therapeutic option for PBD-ZSD patients carrying the PEX1-G843D mutation. Here, we studied whether autophagy inhibition by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and 3-methyladenine indeed can improve peroxisomal functions in four different cell types with the PEX1-G843D mutation, including primary patient cells. Furthermore, we studied whether autophagy inhibition may be the mechanism underlying the previously reported improvement of peroxisomal functions by L-arginine in PEX1-G843D cells. In contrast to L-arginine, we observed no improvement but a worsening of peroxisomal metabolic functions and peroxisomal matrix protein import by the autophagy inhibitors, while genetic knock-down of ATG5 and NBR1 in primary patient cells resulted in only a minimal improvement.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the most relevant data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the review's methodology and the characteristics and methodological quality of the retrieved studies. METHODS: We searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 42 assessed the effect of social distances measure of physical health and 27 on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods.

Household surveys that record childrens vaccination dates can be used to quantify occurrence of MOSVs and their impact on achievable vaccination coverage. We recently automated some MOSV analyses in the World Health Organizations freely available software: Vaccination Coverage Quality Indicators (VCQI) making it straightforward to study MOSVs for any Demographic & Health Survey (DHS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), or Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) survey. This paper uses VCQI to analyze MOSVs for basic vaccine doses among children aged 12C23 months in four rounds of DHS in Colombia (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) and five rounds of DHS in Nigeria (1999, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018). Outcomes include percent of vaccination visits MOSVs occurred, percent of children who experienced MOSVs, percent of MOSVs that remained uncorrected (that is, the missed vaccine had still not been received at the time of the survey), and the distribution of time-to-correction for children who received the MOSV dose at a later visit.","output":"Using Household Surveys to Assess Missed Opportunities for Simultaneous Vaccination: Longitudinal Examples from Colombia and Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The next influenza pandemic may be imminent. Because antiviral agents and vaccines will be unavailable to people in most countries, we need to determine whether other agents could offer clinical benefits. Influenza is associated with an increase in acute cardiovascular diseases, and influenza viruses induce proinflammatory cytokines. Statins are cardioprotective and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and they thus might benefit patients with influenza. This hypothesis should be evaluated by using administrative databases to search for reduced rates of hospitalization and death due to influenza-related conditions among people taking statins. These studies should be followed by laboratory studies of statins in animal and cell-based models of influenza virus infection and, later, by clinical trials. Positive results from such studies would provide physicians in all countries with something to offer patients for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza. Generic statins will be widely distributed and inexpensive.

At the same time, oncology and surgery societies altered treatment guidelines, favoring postponement of surgery. The aim of the present study is to determine the impact of the pandemic in the management of colorectal cancer patients. We confirmed that during the pandemic, patients were more likely to present with metastatic cancer, often requiring emergent or palliative interventions. In addition, neoadjuvant therapy and conventional open surgery utilization rates were increased in the pandemic era. These observed changes in clinical practice may be associated with tumor upstaging, which carries significant implications regarding the long-term oncologic survival of patients with colorectal neoplasias. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the management of colorectal cancer patients requiring surgery and to examine whether the restructuring of healthcare systems led to cancer stage upshifting or adverse treatment outcomes; (2) Methods: A systematic literature search of the MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI databases was performed (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021288432). Data were summarized as odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs); (3) Results: Ten studies were examined, including 26,808 patients. The number of patients presenting with metastases during the pandemic was significantly increased (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02C2.67, p = 0.04), with no differences regarding the extent of the primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) status. Patients were more likely to have undergone neoadjuvant therapy (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09C1.37, p < 0.001), while emergency presentations (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.07C2.84, p = 0.03) and palliative surgeries (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13C3.36, p = 0.02) were more frequent during the pandemic. There was no significant difference recorded in terms of postoperative morbidity; (4) Conclusions: Patients during the pandemic were more likely to undergo palliative interventions or receive neoadjuvant treatment.","output":"Colorectal Surgery in the COVID-19 Era: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia in China and it spread quickly to other countries Although Covid-19 causes severe pneumonia, it is known that it can be associated with different diseases and prognosis of disease can be due to many of disorders such as hyponatremia A 65-year-old female patient with sarcoidosis, cronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension and congestive heart failure presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and fever Oropharyngeal swab for Covid-19 PCR test was positive After the initiation of treatment, the patient developed hyponatremia This case is remarkable because there is no reported case of Covid-19 and inappropriate ADH syndrome coexistence and it demonstrates that there may be a correlation between Covid-19 infection prognosis and hyponatremia","output":"A case of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Syndrome Associated with COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Niclosamide is an oral anthelmintic drug, approved for use against tapeworm infections.

In the present study, we functionally characterised the contribution of the aniline 4-NO(2) group on niclosamide to its cellular activities. We demonstrated that niclosamide induces genome-wide DNA damage that is mechanistically uncoupled from its antitumour effects mediated through mitochondrial uncoupling. Elimination of the nitro group in ND-Nic analogue significantly reduced H2AX signals and DNA breaks while preserving its antitumour mechanism mediated through a calcium signalling pathway and arachidonic acid metabolism. Lipidomics profiling further revealed that ND-Nic-treated cells retained a metabolite profile characteristic of niclosamide-treated cells. Notably, quantitative scoring of drug sensitivity suggests that elimination of its nitro group enhanced the target selectivity of niclosamide against p53 deficiency. Importantly, the results also raise concern that niclosamide may impose a pleiotropic genotoxic effect, which limits its clinical efficacy and warrants further investigation into alternative drug analogues that may ameliorate any potential unwanted side effects.","output":"Nitro-Deficient Niclosamide Confers Reduced Genotoxicity and Retains Mitochondrial Uncoupling Activity for Cancer Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate the effectiveness of the containment on the epidemic spreading of the new Coronavirus disease 2019, we carry on an analysis of the time evolution of the infection in a selected number of different Countries, by considering well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law We also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law Our data analysis permits an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals The daily data must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under control From our analysis, it appears that the spreading reached saturation in China, due to the strong containment policy of the national government In Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new strong spreading For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals","output":"Data analysis on Coronavirus spreading by macroscopic growth laws"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane particles that contribute to cancer progression and metastases by transporting biologically significant proteins and nucleic acids.

However, the proteomic content of EVs isolated from young womens breast cancer patients and the mechanisms underlying the influence of EVs on tumor cell behavior have not yet been reported. METHODS: In our current translational studies, we compared the proteomic content of EVs isolated from invasive breast cancer cell lines and plasma samples from young womens breast cancer (YWBC) patients and age-matched healthy donors using mass spectrometry. We analyzed the functionality of EVs in two dimensional tumor cell invasion assays and the gene expression changes in tumor cells after incubation with EVs. RESULTS: We found that treatment with EVs from both invasive breast cancer cell lines and plasma of YWBC patients altered the invasive properties of non-invasive breast cancer cells. Proteomics identified differences between EVs from YWBC patients and healthy donors that correlated with their altered function. Further, we identified gene expression changes in non-invasive breast cancer cells after treatment with EVs that implicate the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) signaling pathway as a potential targetable pathway affected by breast cancer-derived EVs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the proteome of EVs from breast cancer patients reflects their functionality in tumor motility assays and may help elucidate the role of EVs in breast cancer progression.","output":"Extracellular vesicles from young womens breast cancer patients drive increased invasion of non-malignant cells via the Focal Adhesion Kinase pathway: a proteomic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine how local government websites quality in implementing sound governance principles, transparency, accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, and website features.

METHODS: Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with PN stakeholders (n=17) from diverse cancer care settings. Thematic content analysis was conducted by deductively coding major themes based on constructs from the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainability framework and by inductively coding emergent themes. RESULTS: Facilitators in the outer context included payer guidelines, accreditation requirements, community partnerships, and demonstrated need and demand for services. Inner context factors such as alignment with organizational and leadership priorities, appropriate staff support and workloads, and relative advantage were important to program success. Innovation characteristics such as the presence of innovation champions, clear role and scope of practice, clear protocols, strong communication channels, and innovation fit were facilitators of program success.

Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Objective: To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (>14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those &#8805;80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW >14.5% vs &#8804;14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.","output":"Association of Red Blood Cell Distribution Width With Mortality Risk in Hospitalized Adults With SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of children admitted to the PICU for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 394 patients, 171 (43.4%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were more likely younger (2-12 yr vs adolescents; p < 0.01), Black (35.6% vs 21.9%; p < 0.01), present with fever/abdominal pain than cough/dyspnea (p < 0.01), and less likely to have comorbidities (33.3% vs 61.9%; p < 0.01) compared with those without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Inflammatory marker levels, use of inotropes/vasopressors, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants were higher in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients (p < 0.01). Overall mortality was 3.8% (15/394), with no difference in the two groups. Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was associated with longer duration of hospitalization as compared to nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (7.5 d[interquartile range, 5-11] vs 5.3 d [interquartile range, 3-11 d]; p < 0.01). Critical illness occurred in 164 patients (41.6%) and was more common in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children compared with those without (55.6% vs 30.9%; p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis failed to show an association between critical illness and age, race, sex, greater than or equal to three signs and symptoms, or greater than or equal to two comorbidities among the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children cohort. Among nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients, the presence of greater than or equal to two comorbidities was associated with greater odds of critical illness (odds ratio 2.95 [95% CI, 1.61-5.40]; p < 0.01).

The viral titers increased to 10(7.6) TCID(50)/mL (100th) by serial passages. The spike (S) gene and the whole gene of the SDSX16 virus was fully sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness to previously identified PEDV. Along with successive passage in vitro, there were 18 nucleotides (nt) deletion occurred in the spike (S) gene resulting in a deletion of six amino acids when the SDSX16 strain was passaged to the 64th generation, and this deletion was stable until the P100. However, the ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3 genes had only a few point mutations in amino acids and no deletions.

Here, we did whole blood immunophenotyping along with plasma cytokine, chemokine, antibody isotyping and viral load determination from oropharyngeal swab to understand the immune pathology in the T2DM patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Methods: Blood samples from 25 Covid-19 positive patients having T2DM, 10 Covid-19 positive patients not having T2DM and 10 Covid-19 negative, non-diabetic healthy controls were assessed for various immune cells by analyzing for their signature surface proteins in mass cytometry. Circulating cytokines, chemokines and antibody isotypes were determined from plasma. Viral copy number was determined from oropharyngeal swabs. All our representative data corroborated with laboratory findings. Results: Our observations encompass T2DM patients having elevated levels of both type I and type II cytokines and higher levels of circulating IgA, IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 as compared to NDM and healthy volunteers. They also displayed higher percentages of granulocytes, mDCs, plasmablasts, Th2-like cells, CD4+ EM cells, CD8+ TE cells as compared to healthy volunteers. T2DM patients also displayed lower percentages of pDCs, lymphocytes, CD8+ TE cells, CD4+, CD8+ EM.

Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020, were recruited from two hospitals. Respiratory samples were collected and tested with LAMP and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. The inconsistent samples between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. In addition, we tested the RT-LAMP on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections. Results We finally collected a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and the independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). RT-LAMP was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The median time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample to result.

The DID results further show that the price surge peaked in the fourth week of lockdown but gradually came down to the level of a normal year by week 11. However, the price rose again (though to a much smaller extent) in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in a few provinces in early-mid April but quickly returned to the normal level in week 15 when the lockdown measures were largely removed.

The Krebs Von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) as a sensitive marker reflects the degree of fibrosis and this study will focus on analyzing the evaluative efficacy and predictive role of KL-6 in COVID-19 secondary pulmonary fibrosis. The study lasted more than three months and included total 289 COVID-19 patients who were divided into moderate (n=226) and severe groups (n=63) according to the severity of illness. Clinical information such as inflammation indicators, radiological results and lung function tests were collected. The time points of nucleic acid test were also recorded. Furthermore, based on Chest radiology detection, it was identified that 80 (27.7%) patients developed reversible pulmonary fibrosis and 34 (11.8%) patients developed irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that KL-6 could diagnose the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.862) and predict the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (AUC = 0.741) and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (AUC=0.872). Importantly, the cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that KL-6 rises earlier than the development of lung radiology fibrosis, thus also illuminating the predictive function of KL-6. We set specific values (505U/mL and 674U/mL) for KL-6 in order to assess the risk of pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The survival curves for days in hospital show that the higher the KL-6 levels, the longer the hospital stay (P<0.0001).

Four main domains stood out: health communication, prevention, support and research. Strengthening local surveillance systems, geographic contact tracing, support for clinical practice and data collection of real-time longitudinal data at the population level are some of the main advantages of the applications reported so far. The potential conflict to data privacy urges for discussion on their use in a responsible manner. Along with fair regulation and close monitoring of data collection and process, data anonymisation must be a standard and personal data must be deleted after its usage. Preparation is key for effective containment of a public health crisis and learning lessons on the role of mobile technologies is useful for future challenges in global health.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest challenge for pancreatic surgeons is the difficulty in providing oncological care. In this review article, from the standpoint of surgeons, we explain the concept of triaging of patients with pancreatic tumors under the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actual impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumors. The most vital points in selecting the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic are (1) Oncologists need to tailor the treatment plan based on the COVID-19 phase, tumor malignant potential, and patients comorbidities;and (2) Optimal treatment for pancreatic cancer should be planned according to the condition of each patient and tumor resectability based on national comprehensive cancer network resectability criteria. To choose the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic, we need to tailor the treatment plan based on elective surgery acuity scale (ESAS). Newly established ESAS for pancreatic tumor and flowchart indicating the treatment strategy of pancreatic cancer, are feasible to overcome this situation. ?The Author(s) 2021.

While tectonic plate motions provide evidence for this relation, the mechanism by which mantle processes influence near-surface tectonics remains elusive. Here, we present an azimuthal anisotropy model for the Pacific Northwest crust that strongly correlates with high-velocity structures in the underlying mantle but shows no association with the regional mantle flow field. We suggest that the crustal anisotropy is decoupled from horizontal basal tractions and, instead, created by upper mantle vertical loading, which generates pressure gradients that drive channelized flow in the mid-lower crust. We then demonstrate the interplay between mantle heterogeneities and lithosphere dynamics by predicting the viscous crustal flow that is driven by local buoyancy sources within the upper mantle. Our findings reveal how mantle vertical load distribution can actively control crustal deformation on a scale of several hundred kilometers.","output":"Seismic anisotropy reveals crustal flow driven by mantle vertical loading in the Pacific NW."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused series of lockdown in Malaysia which led to the significant financial impact to dental practitioner in Malaysia.

This special issue devoted to the resulting disease COVID-19 was not planned but instead the articles accumulated organically as researchers in the cell stress response field noticed similarities among the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections and the responses that they studied in contexts unrelated to viral infection. We preface the issue with an introductory article which begins with a brief review of the structure and biology of SARS-CoV-2. As we collected and compared the COVID-19 articles, several shared themes emerged. In the second part of the introduction, each article is summarized briefly and the common themes that link each into a spontaneously arising chain of ideas and hypotheses are emphasized. These themes include growing evidence of molecular mimicry among the viral proteins and the proteins of patients. The realization that much of the consequences of such immune mimicry may play out on the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells raised the specter of autoimmune-induced vascular endothelial damage in multiple organs. Proposals of new therapeutic approaches have coalesced around the theme of inducing protection of the vascular endothelium. New chemical treatments that are proposed include stannous chloride, inducers of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide such as sodium thiosulfate and inducers of the cytoprotective stress protein heme oxygenase. Oxygen delivered by ventilators is already in extensive use to provide life support for patients with severe COVID-19. Two articles propose to advance the use of oxygen to the level of a therapeutic treatment early in the detection of the virus in infected patients by delivering oxygen under elevated pressure in hyperbaric chambers. At elevated blood plasma concentrations, hyperbaric oxygen is capable of achieving results far beyond the capability of ventilators as it promotes the activation of transcription factors that control the establishment of inducible cellular defense systems.","output":"Coronaviruses and stress: from cellular to global"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the outbreak has reached every region of the world, it is undeniable that countries in the southern hemisphere seem to be less affected, where cases have been reported, these have been imported and travel related.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2016, data were prospectively collected for patients who underwent ch-EVAR using long PGs. Data included patient demographics and aortic anatomy, technical success, patency and reintervention rate. RESULTS A total of 29 long PGs were placed in 18 patients (males 16, average age 71 years). Nine (50%) suffered from thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 4 (22%) from juxtarenal aortic aneurysms and 3 (17%) from suprarenal aortic aneurysms and 2 (11%) were treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms that required revascularization of a pelvic kidney. Twenty (70%) of the PGs were 100 mm in length, and 9 (30%) were 150 mm. Long PGs were successfully placed in 16 (89%) patients. Two patients (11%) expired in the perioperative period. Mean period of follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Sac size decreased in size or remained unchanged in 13 patients (72%). Three patients with sac enlargement underwent successful endovascular treatment the type 1A gutter endoleaks. None required reintervention of the PGs. Three patients expired, none from aneurysm-related deaths. CONCLUSION The use of long PGs is a feasible technique and provides a durable repair of complex aortic aneurysms in midterm follow-up. Despite the length of the PGs, gutter endoleaks are encountered only in a minority of the cases and can be treated minimally invasive techniques.","output":"Long Parallel Stent Grafts for the Treatment of Complex Aortic Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poxviruses are important pathogens of man and numerous domestic and wild animal species.

Emerging adults are clinically challenging in terms of harmful cannabis use due to perceptions of high rates of peer use, social acceptance, and low risk of harm. Brief interventions to increase awareness and promote motivation to change are therefore particularly important for this age group. There is existing evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions for alcohol in emerging adults, but it is not clear if comparable evidence is present for cannabis. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the existing literature of brief interventions for cannabis use both narratively, to describe the content and delivery of existing interventions, and meta-analytically, to determine the aggregated efficacy of these interventions on cannabis use and other outcomes (e.g., other substance use, mental health, help-seeking behaviors, and academic and occupational outcomes). METHODS A systematic search of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental trials, and pre-post designs will be conducted in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO. Ongoing trials will be identified using the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov , and Current Controlled Trials. Unpublished trials will be identified using Proquest Dissertations, OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and brief interventions on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration webpage. Two authors will independently screen and extract data from articles using a predetermined screening and extraction forms (which will include risk of bias assessments). Calibration exercises will be performed prior to full screening and extraction. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer.

The goal of this study was to investigate survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients who received prophylactic or therapeutic dose AC and analyze the mortality rate with respect to detailed demographic and clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York who received either prophylactic (n = 158) or therapeutic dose AC (n = 153). Primary outcome was in-hospital death assessed by survival analysis and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: For the first 3 weeks of ICU stay, we observed similar survival curves for prophylactic and therapeutic AC groups. However, after 3 or more weeks of ICU stay, the therapeutic AC group, characterized by high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), had markedly higher death incidence rates with 8.6 deaths (95% CI = 6.2C11.9 deaths) per 1,000 person-days and about 5 times higher risk of death (adj. HR = 4.89, 95% CI = 1.71C14.0, p = 0.003) than the prophylactic group (2.4 deaths [95% CI = 0.9C6.3 deaths] per 1,000 person-days). Among therapeutic AC users with prolonged ICU admission, non-survivors were characterized by older males with depressed lymphocyte counts and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise the possibility that prolonged use of high dose AC, independent of thrombotic events or clinical background, might be associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AKI, age, lymphocyte count, and cardiovascular disease may represent important risk factors that could help identify at-risk patients who require long-term hospitalization with therapeutic dose AC treatment.","output":"Prophylactic versus therapeutic dose anticoagulation effects on survival among critically ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Workplace demands, support, and relationships differ according to employment status (e.g., employment that is full-time, part-time, or self-employed) and may lead to unequal opportunities to keep diabetic appointments. We investigated the association between employment status and outpatient diabetic appointment non-attendance among working-age adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial (the Japan diabetes outcome intervention trial 2 large-scale trial). The analysis included 2010 trial participants (40-65 years old) with type 2 diabetes who were regularly followed by primary care physicians (PCPs). The outcome measure was the first non-attendance (defined as a failure to visit a PCP within 2 months of the original appointment) during the one-year follow-up. The association between baseline employment status and non-attendance was examined using Cox proportional hazard model in men and women. RESULTS: During the 1279 and 789 person-year follow-up periods, 90 men and 34 women, respectively, experienced their first appointment non-attendance. Among men, self-employed participants had a higher risk of non-attendance compared with full-time employees (adjusted HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.15, 2.95). The trial intervention (attendance promotion) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of non-attendance among self-employed participants (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.99). Among women, a significant association between employment status and non-attendance was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Self-employed men with type 2 diabetes had a twofold increased risk of non-attendance than did full-time employees.

Methods: : The general data, epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging characteristics of 38 patients with suspected COVID-19, admitted between January 21 and March 5, 2020, were analyzed. Results: : According to the results of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing, the patients were divided into study group (RNA positive) and control group (RNA negative). Ultimately, 8 cases were RNA-positive and diagnosed as CDVID-19, and 30 cases were negative. Approximately half of the patients in the study group returned to Chongqing from Wuhan;this number was significantly larger than that of the control group (P<0.05). The number of subjects in close contact with the confirmed cases with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive and the incidence of aggregation was significantly larger in the study group than in the control group (both P<0.05). The clinical symptom of the study group was mainly low fever (with or without cough). The patients with decreased white blood cells (WBC) in the study group were significantly more than those in the control group (P<0.05). Both group had reduced lymphocytes (Lym) but the number of patients with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) in the study group was significantly more than that in the control group (P<0.05). There were different degrees of chest CT abnormalities in both study and control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The epidemiological investigations in screening for infectious diseases is crucial. The risk of infection was high from the primary epidemic area and/or in close contact with the confirmed case. The most common form of clustering occurrence was family aggregation. CDVID-19 was mainly characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, although asymptomatic infection may also occur. Decreased WBC, decreased Lym, and increased CRP are common characteristics but can also be combined with other respiratory tract virus infections.

To confirm the effect of mass vaccination, this study analyzed the patterns of confirmed cases within Korean military units. METHODS: From August 1 to September 15, 2021, all epidemiological data regarding confirmed COVID-19 cases in military units were reviewed. The number of confirmed cases in the units that were believed to have achieved herd immunity (i.e.,  70% vaccination) was compared with the number of cases in the units that were not believed to have reached herd immunity (< 70% vaccination). Additionally, trends in the incidence rates of COVID-19 in the military and the entire Korean population were compared. RESULTS: By August 2021, 85.60% of military personnel were fully vaccinated. During the study period, a total of 174 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the 39 units. More local transmission (herd immunity group vs. non-herd immunity group [%], 1 [0.91] vs. 39 [60.94]) and hospitalizations (12 [11.01] vs. 13 [27.08]) occurred in the units that were not believed to have achieved herd immunity. The percentage of fully vaccinated individuals among the confirmed COVID-19 cases increased over time, possibly due to the prevalence of the delta variant. Nevertheless, the incidence rate remained lower in military units than in the general Korean population. CONCLUSION: After completing mass vaccination, the incidence rates of COVID-19 infection in the military were lower than those in the national population. New cluster infections did not occur in vaccinated units, thereby suggesting that herd immunity has been achieved in these military units. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which levels of non-pharmacological intervention can be reduced in the future.","output":"Analyses of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases Among Korean Military Personnel After Mass Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disordered social media use, often referred to as social media addiction, has not been officially recognized by medical bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association or the World Health Organization.

However, the diff operation introduced in the literature is merely instrumental to this purpose and has only a purely formal meaning (it is obtained from the Skolemization of the extensionality axiom). Our maxdiff operation significantly increases the level of expressivity; however, obtaining interpolation results for the resulting theory becomes a surprisingly hard task.

We previously reported that lower SERPINA1 expression in tumor tissues and higher levels of plasma AAT are associated with worse survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we sought to examine TMPRSS2 and SERPINA1/AAT expression in tumor and adjacent lung tissues from 347 NSCLC patients. Based on clinical data and gene expression analysis, we performed Cox regression for the survival analysis, and correlated TMPRSS2 and AAT protein levels in tissue samples by immunohistochemical and western blot analyses. We found that lower TMPRSS2 expression in tumor compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues is linked to a poor overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and those who are current smokers. IHC staining of TMPRSS2 validated our findings in regard to overall survival while we did not observe a correlation with AAT staining. Based on western blot analyses, we found only a slight negative correlation between full-length TMPRSS2 and AAT in non-tumor tissues, which seems to be related to smoking status.

Due to a paucity of literature and experience surrounding display use and standardization in pathology, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) has currently restricted FDA-cleared whole-slide imaging systems to a specific model of display for each system, which at this time consists of only medical-grade (MG) displays. Further, given that a pathologists display will essentially become their new surrogate microscope, it becomes exceedingly important that all pathologists have a basic understanding of fundamental display properties and their functional consequences. This review seeks to: (a) define and summarize the current and emerging display technology, terminology, features, and regulation as they pertain to pathologists and review the current literature on the impact of different display types (e.g. MG vs. consumer off the shelf vs. professional grade) on pathologists diagnostic performance and (b) discuss the impact of the recent digital pathology device componentization and the coronavirus disease 2019 public emergency on the pixel pathway and display use for remote digital pathology. Display technology has changed dramatically over the past 20 years and continues to change at a rapid rate. There is a paucity of published studies to date that investigate how display type affects pathologist performance, with more research necessary in order to develop standards and minimum specifications for displays in digital pathology. Given the complexity of modern displays, pathologists must become better informed regarding display technology if they wish to have more choice over their future microscopes.","output":"Display Characteristics and Their Impact on Digital Pathology: A Current Review of Pathologists Future Microscope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various anthropogenic and natural events over the years have gradually increased human exposure to various heavy metals. Several of these heavy metals including cadmium, mercury, nickel, chromium, and the metalloid arsenic among others, have created major public health concerns for their high level of toxicities. Identification of the general as well as the differentially affected cellular metabolic pathways will help understanding the molecular mechanism of different heavy metal-induced toxicities. In this study, we analyzed 25 paired (control vs. treated) transcriptomic datasets derived following treatment of various human cells with different heavy metals and metalloid (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel and vanadium) to identify the affected metabolic pathways. The effects of these metals on metabolic pathways depend not only on the metals per se, but also on the nature of the treated cells. Tissue of origin, therefore, must be considered while assessing the effects of any particular heavy metal or metalloid. Among the metals and metalloid, arsenic appears to have relatively more pleiotropic influences on cellular metabolic pathways including those known to have association with diabetes. Although only two stem cell derived datasets are included in the current study, effects of heavy metals on these cells appear to be different from other mature cells of similar tissue origin. This study provides useful information about different heavy metal affected pathways, which may be useful in further exploration using wet-lab based techniques.","output":"Effects of arsenic and heavy metals on metabolic pathways in cells of human origin: Similarities and differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised children might be predisposed to serious infections from human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including strains OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E; however, the virologic and clinical features of HCoV infection in immunocompromised children have not been compared to those in nonimmunocompromised children. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children who presented to Seattle Childrens Hospital and in whom HCoV was detected by a multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasal sample between October 2012 and March 2016. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was defined as possible or definite infiltrate seen in chest imaging, need for oxygen, or abnormal lung examination in conjunction with a physician diagnosis of LRTD. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate risk factors for LRTD and LRTD that necessitated oxygen use (severe LRTD), including an immunocompromised state, in children with HCoV infection. RESULTS: The median ages of 85 immunocompromised and 1152 nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV infection were 6.3 and 1.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of LRTD and of severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients (22% vs 26% [LRTD] and 15% vs 11% [severe LRTD], respectively); however, in a multivariable model, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased likelihood of severe LRTD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2C4.9]; P = .01). Younger age, having an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the presence of respiratory syncytial virus were also associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. The risks of LRTD or severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD. Recognizing risk factors for severe respiratory illness might assist in risk stratification.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Coronavirus Infection in Children: The Role of Viral Factors and an Immunocompromised State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the analysis of the Gender Diversity Index (GDI), which is an Index developed by Solactive AG and is calculated and distributed by this provider.

Effectively cutting the transmission of COVID-19 is essential to reduce the impact. Previous studies have observed the potential relationship between the built environment and COVID-19 transmission, however, to date, stringent studies investigating these relationships at the individual level are still insufficient. Here, we aim to examine the relationship between household types and COVID-19 infection (or mental health) during the early stages of the pandemic by using the All of Us Research Program COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) Survey data. Design: Based on 62,664 participants' responses to COPE from May to July 2020, we matched the cases of self-reported COVID-19 status, anxiety, or stress, with controls of the same race, sex, age group, and survey version. We conducted multiple logistic regressions between one of the outcomes and household type under the adjustment of other related covariates, such as ethnicity, age, social distancing behavior, and house occupancy. Results: Household type with a shared component was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; p=2x10-4), anxiety (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4; p=1.1x10-6), and stress (OR=1.29, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4, p=4.3x10-10) as compared to free-standing houses after adjusted for the abovementioned confounding factors. Further, frequent nonessential shopping or outings, another indicator of built environment, was also associated with COVID-19 infection (OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; p=0.02), but not associated with elevated mental health conditions. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the built environment of houses with a shared component tends to increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission, which consequently led to more anxiety and stress for their dwellers. It also suggested the necessity to improve the quality of the built environment through planning, design, and management toward a more resilient society in coping with future pandemics.","output":"Built environment's impact on COVID-19 transmission and mental health revealed by COVID-19 Participant Experience data from the All of Us Research Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global economy is in the midst of an unprecedented slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The analysis indicates that the prevalence of infectious diseases has an economically and statistically significant negative effect on nonfinancial corporate performance. This adverse impact is particularly pronounced on smaller and younger firms, compared to larger and more established corporations. We also find that a higher number of infectious-disease cases in population increases the probability of failure among nonfinancial firms, particularly for small and young firms.

Infection also consistently leads to transient immune-suppression. BoHV-1 is the number one infectious agent in cattle that is associated with abortions in cattle. BoHV-1, as other -herpesvirinae subfamily members, establishes latency in sensory neurons. Stressful stimuli, mimicked by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone, consistently induce reactivation from latency in latently infected calves and rabbits. Increased corticosteroid levels due to stress have a two-pronged effect on reactivation from latency by: (1) directly stimulating viral gene expression and replication, and (2) impairing antiviral immune responses, thus enhancing virus spread and transmission. BoHV-1 encodes several proteins, bICP0, bICP27, gG, UL49.5, and VP8, which interfere with key antiviral innate immune responses in the absence of other viral genes. Furthermore, the ability of BoHV-1 to infect lymphocytes and induce apoptosis, in particular CD4+ T cells, has negative impacts on immune responses during acute infection. BoHV-1 induced immune-suppression can initiate the poly-microbial disorder known as bovine respiratory disease complex, which costs the US cattle industry more than one billion dollars annually. Furthermore, interfering with antiviral responses may promote viral spread to ovaries and the developing fetus, thus enhancing reproductive issues associated with BoHV-1 infection of cows or pregnant cows.

Previous studies have suggested that probiotics seem to be a new and promising alternative to vaccinations to protect animals against potential viral infections. In this study, we used the Vero cell culture model of infection to study porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). We screened lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with anti-PEDV potential from kefir grains, which are starter cultures used to ferment milk into kefir. Twenty-nine LAB strains were isolated and identified as Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, according to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and rpoA gene sequence analyses. The anti-PEDV activities of the LAB intracellular extracts were compared, and the intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides showed higher anti-PEDV activities than that of the other species. Among the Ln. mesenteroides strains, a strain designated YPK30 showed a higher growth rate than that of the other strains and was further evaluated for its anti-PEDV activity. The results showed that the intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 possessed in vitro prophylactic, therapeutic, and direct-inhibitory effects against PEDV in the Vero cell model. The expression levels of Type 1 interferon (IFN)-dependent genes, including Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), were significantly increased after treatment with intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 for 24 h. Such expression suggests that the anti-PEDV activity of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 could be attributed to its up-regulatory effect on the expression of MX1 and ISG15 genes.

All patients in this study were male and the overall flap outcome was evaluated with post-operative follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients, in 4 patients modified submental platysmal adipomyofascial flap was used as a combination of flaps for reconstruction. Six patients (33.33%) underwent adjuvant radiation therapy/radiation chemotherapy. The long-term functions (speech and swallowing) and cosmetic outcomes were good in the majority of the patients. One patient (5.55%) had pinhole oroantral fistula. No patient had any major flap failure.

We analyzed expression of ACE2 receptor in primary human cardiac stromal cells using proteomic and transcriptomic methods before exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using conventional and high sensitivity PCR methods, we measured virus production in the cellular supernatants and monitored the intracellular viral bioprocessing. We performed high-resolution imaging to show the sites of intracellular viral production. We finally used Q-RT-PCR assays to detect genes linked to innate immunity and fibrotic pathways coherently regulated in cells exposed to virus. Our findings indicate that human cardiac stromal cells have a susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and produce variable viral yields depending on the extent of cellular ACE2 receptor expression.

Here we present a novel deep learning-enabled integrated algorithmic workflow to merge the two concepts for radical discovery of de novo protein materials, exploiting musical creativity as the foundation, and extrapolating through a recursive method to increase protein complexity by successively injecting protein chemistry into the process. Indeed, music is one of the few universal expressions that can create bridges between cultures, find associations between seemingly unrelated concepts, and can be used as a novel way to generate bio-inspired designs that derive functions from the imaginations of the creative mind. Earlier work has offered a pathway to concert proteins into sound, and sound into proteins. Here we build on this paradigm and translate a piece of classical music into matter. Based on J.S. Bach's Goldberg variations, we offer a series of case studies to convert the musical data imagined by the composer into protein design, and folded into a 3D structure using deep learning. The quest we seek to address is to identify semblances, or memories, or information content in such musical creation, that offers new insights into pattern relationships between distinct manifestations of information. Using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis, we find that several fragments of the new proteins display resemblance to existing protein sequences found in proteobacteria among other organisms, especially in regions of low complexity and repetitive motifs. The resulting protein forms the basis for iterative musical composition, and an evolutionary paradigm that defines a variational pathway for melodic development, complementing conventional creative or mathematical methods.

It is unclear how certain species of mycobacteria transition from environmental bacteria to clinical pathogens, or what genetic elements influence the differences in virulence among strains of the same species. A potential mechanism of genetic evolution and diversity within mycobacteria is the presence of integrated viruses called prophages in the host genome. Prophages may act as carriers of bacterial genes, with the potential of altering bacterial fitness through horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we quantify the frequency and composition of prophages within mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples and compare them against the composition of PhagesDB, an environmental mycobacteriophage database. METHODS Prophages were predicted by agreement between two discovery tools, VirSorter and Phaster, and the frequencies of integrated prophages were compared by growth rate. Prophages were assigned to PhagesDB lettered clusters. Bacterial virulence gene frequency was calculated using a combination of the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center virulence database (Patric-VF) within the gene annotation software Prokka. CRISPR elements were discovered using CRT. ARAGORN was used to quantify tRNAs. RESULTS Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were more likely to contain prophage than slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM). CRISPR elements were not associated with prophage abundance in mycobacteria. The abundance of tRNAs was enriched in SGM compared to RGM. We compared the abundance of bacterial virulence genes within prophage genomes from clinical isolates to mycobacteriophages from PhagesDB. Our data suggests that prophages from clinical mycobacteria are enriched for bacterial virulence genes relative to environmental mycobacteriophage from PhagesDB. CONCLUSION Prophages are present in clinical NTM isolates. Prophages are more likely to be present in RGM compared to SGM genomes. The mechanism and selective advantage of this enrichment by growth rate remain unclear. In addition, the frequency of bacterial virulence genes in prophages from clinical NTM is enriched relative to the PhagesDB environmental proxy.

In contrast, the other molecular events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention. METHODS: Nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cDNAs were hybridized using RNA samples originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis. A supervised clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles. In addition, specific genes were selected and their preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: From the statistical analysis, 310 differentially expressed genes were identified. Among those genes, 90 were up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. After clustering analysis, 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns were kept for further analysis. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed a strong up-regulation of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 (aqp4) and pendrin (slc26). In addition, a dramatic up-regulation of vasotocin (avt) gene was observed. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), coagulation factor V (cf5), adam 22, and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp up-regulation at the time of oocyte maturation. Finally, ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) exhibited a dramatic down-regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down-regulation of Cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation. CONCLUSION: We showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes, most of them being previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary. Our data confirmed the down-regulation of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period. In addition, the strong up-regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring at that time. Furthermore, among the most up-regulated clones, several genes such as cxcl14, ace2, adam22, cf5 have pro-inflammatory, vasodilatory, proteolytics and coagulatory functions.

It is likely that vaccination is the only way to form \\"herd immunity\\" and restore the world to normal. Here we developed a vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on the virus-like particle AP205 displaying the spike receptor binding motif (RBM), which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patients. To this end, we genetically fused the RBM domain of SARS-CoV-2 to the C terminus of AP205 of dimerized capsid proteins. The fused VLPs were expressed in E. coli, which resulted in insoluble aggregates. These aggregates were denatured in 8 M urea followed by refolding, which reconstituted VLP formation as confirmed by electron microscopy analysis. Importantly, immunized mice were able to generate high levels of IgG antibodies recognizing eukaryotically expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, induced antibodies were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2/ABS/NL20.

In these days, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the air has become a controversial topic among scientists. Various organizations provide standard methods for monitoring biological agents in the air. Nevertheless, there has been no standard recommended method for sampling and determination of viruses in air. This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results.

They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. Methods By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. Results It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. Conclusion There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed.

The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

Previous researches have shown that short-term mechanical stretch induces stem cell proliferation through activating the predominant transcription factor YAP, and YAP is a critical modulator in controlling epidermal proliferation. However, our study finds that after this phase, the cell growth arrest appears which is induced by long-term mechanical stretch. In the interfollicular epidermal stem cells (IFESCs) undergoing long-term mechanical stretch in vivo and in vitro, the level of H3K27me3 and its histone methyltransferase EZH2 are significantly elevated with suppressed expression of the target genes of YAP. EZH2 forms repressive H3K27me3 that suppresses gene transcription. Small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 rescues significantly the cell growth arrest in IFESCs induced by long-term mechanical stretch, thus promoting epidermal proliferation in vivo again. These findings reveal that there is an unexpected correlation between stem cell proliferation and the duration of mechanical stretch regulated by EZH2.

This may have adverse long-term consequences on a childs development. Given the rise in technology and parents preferences for mobile health apps, a supportive mobile health intervention is optimal. However, there is a lack of a theoretical framework and technology-based perinatal educational intervention for couples with healthy infants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the Supportive Parenting App (SPA) development procedure and highlight the challenges and lessons learned. METHODS: The SPA development procedure was guided by the information systems research framework, which emphasizes a nonlinear, iterative, and user-centered process involving 3 research cyclesthe relevance cycle, design cycle, and rigor cycle. Treatment fidelity was ensured, and team cohesiveness was maintained using strategies from the Tuckman model of team development. RESULTS: In the relevance cycle, end-user requirements were identified through focus groups and interviews. In the rigor cycle, the user engagement pyramid and well-established theories (social cognitive theory proposed by Bandura and attachment theory proposed by Bowlby) were used to inform and justify the features of the artifact. In the design cycle, the admin portal was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, whereas the SPA, which ran on both iOS and Android, was developed using hybrid development tools. The SPA featured knowledge-based content, informational videos and audio clips, a discussion forum, chat groups, and a frequently asked questions and expert advice section. The intervention underwent iterative testing by a small group of new parents and research team members. Qualitative feedback was obtained for further app enhancements before official implementation. Testing revealed user and technological issues, such as web browser and app incompatibility, a lack of notifications for both administrators and users, and limited search engine capability. CONCLUSIONS: The information systems research framework documented the technical details of the SPA but did not take into consideration the interpersonal and real-life challenges. Ineffective communication between the health care research team and the app developers, limited resources, and the COVID-19 pandemic were the main challenges faced during content development. Quick adaptability, team cohesion, and hindsight budgeting are crucial for intervention development.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 7,000,000 deaths are attributed to direct tobacco use, while approximately 1,200,000 non-smokers exposed to second hand cigarette smoke die every year. Accordingly, tobacco use is a major threat to the public health infrastructure; therefore, proper cessation interventions must be put in place to curb tobacco abuse and ease economic and social burdens caused by the tobacco epidemic. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to investigate how scientific efforts have been advanced towards harm reduction among smokers and non-smokers. Relevant articles published during the period 2010C2020 in PubMed, Crossref, Google scholar, and Web of Science were used in this study. The articles were selected based on health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco cessation and emerging diseases, including Covid?19. Various cessation strategies have been identified although their efficiency is yet to match the desired results. RESULTS: A series of carcinogenic chemicals are generated during cigarette smoking resulting in serious health complications such as cancer and mutagenesis. The precursors for tobacco induced diseases are toxic and carcinogenic chemicals of the nitrosamine type, aldehydes, polonium-210 and benzo[a]pyrene, which bio-accumulate in the body system during cigarette smoking to cause disease. Rehabilitation facilities, use of drugs to diminish the desire to smoke, heavy taxation of tobacco products and warning labels on cigarettes are some of the cessation strategies employed towards curbing tobacco abuse. CONCLUSION: The need for further research to develop better methods and research based policies for safe cigarette smoking and workable cessation strategies must be a priority in order to deal with the tobacco epidemic.

Most studies tested interventions designed to improve higher-order thinking skills, or executive functions, that are thought to underpin decision-making. Of these, interventions targeting logical reasoning, cognitive control and inhibition demonstrated the best results. Risk of bias arising from poor quality research design or reporting affected most studies.

After 7 days of hospitalization, she had a positive RTCPCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with progressive worsening of her clinical condition and acute foetal distress. Hence emergency caesarean section was performed. After the birth, the patient required mechanical ventilation, progressing to multiple organ system failures. Conventional inotropic drugs, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation for 30 days in the intensive care unit provided significant clinical, haemodynamic, and respiratory improvement. However, on the 37th day, she suddenly experienced respiratory failure, gastrointestinal and airway bleeding, culminating in death. DISCUSSION : Progressive physiological changes during pregnancy cause cardiovascular complications in women with severe heart disease and higher susceptibility to viral infection and severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is known to incite an intense inflammatory and prothrombotic response with clinical expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome, heart failure, and thromboembolic events.

METHODS The patients with ureteral stones were collected from 24 January to 24 March 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing. Two periods were divided for study: 24 January to 24 February (Period 1) and 25 February to 24 March (Period 2). Data on patients' characteristics, attendance, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, stone features, and final treatment choices were retrieved from the computer and compared with the data in the same periods in 2019. RESULTS The study included 376 patients with ureteral stones during the COVID-19 outbreak periods in 2020 and 343 patients during the same periods in 2019. Compared with the same periods in 2019, the number of patients with ureteral stones was less in Period 1 (137 vs 163) but had a rebound phenomenon in Period 2 (239 vs 180). The visit frequency was significantly reduced (2.6  0.4 vs 3.6  0.8, p < 0.01) and the VAS scores and the onset time increased (7.7  1.3 vs 5.5  1.6, p < 0.01; 7.4  1.8 vs 8.2  1.5, p < 0.01, respectively) in Period 1. More patients chose oral analgesics medication to release from renal colic in the COVID-19 outbreak period instead of ESWL and intravenous analgesics medication (Period 1, 54.0% vs 20.2%, p < 0.01; Period 2, 20.9% vs 13.3%, p = 0.044; respectively). However, the percentage of patients underwent endoscopy surgery in outbreak period showed no significant difference compared with that in 2019. CONCLUSION These results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak can directly affect the visits and final treatment choices for patients with ureteral stones.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on visits and treatments for patients with ureteral stones in a general hospital emergency department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Icelandic Prevention Model (IPM) is a collaborative upstream model that was designed to influence risk and protective factors related to substance use within the community, school, peer and family contexts. By engaging whole communities, the IPM has been found to be effective in reducing youth substance use behaviours across Iceland. As an extension to the IPM's participatory approach, this research will examine how youth involvement can enhance outcomes. In addition, this research will evaluate whether the IPM approach is beneficial for mental health promotion and general youth wellbeing. METHODS The present research protocol applies the bioecological model within a participatory mixed-method case study design to examine the implementation of the IPM in a rural community in Canada. This study was designed to identify whether the Icelandic substance use prevention model is effective in reducing substance use and promoting mental health and development for Canadian youth. It will also explore how to engage youth within the approach and how this adaptation influences implementation and outcomes.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using the Japanese sarcopenic dysphagia database. SETTING: 19 hospitals including 9 acute care hospitals, 8 rehabilitation hospitals, 2 long-term care hospitals, and 1 home visit rehabilitation team. PARTICIPANTS: 287 patients with sarcopenic dysphagia, aged 20 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: Sarcopenic dysphagia was diagnosed using a reliable and validated diagnostic algorithm for the condition. The presence and characteristics of hoarseness classified as breathy, rough, asthenic, and strained were assessed. The prevalence of hoarseness and the relationship between hoarseness and Food Intake LEVEL Scale (FILS) were examined. Order logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, naso-gastric tube, and handgrip strength was used to examine the relationship between hoarseness and FILS at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age was 83  10 years. Seventy-four (26%) patients had hoarseness, while 32 (11%), 20 (7%), 22 (8%), and 0 (0%) patients had breathy, rough, asthenic, and strained hoarseness, respectively. Median FILS at the initial evaluation was 7 (interquartile range, 5C8). Hoarseness (=0.747, 95% confidence intervals= 0.229, 1.265, p=0.005), age, sex, naso-gastric tube, and handgrip strength were associated independently with baseline FILS, while hoarseness (=0.213, 95% confidence intervals= ?0.324, 0.750, p=0.438) was not associated independently with the FILS at follow-up.

Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. RESULTS: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. CONCLUSIONS: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","output":"[Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?]/ Les professionnels de sant face  la pandmie de la maladie  coronavirus (COVID-19) : quels risques pour leur sant mentale ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for direct-to-home telemedicine services has risen to an unprecedented level Equal access to specialty care was assessed to identify potential barriers that may negatively impact telemedicine utilization METHODS: We examined the 6-week period between March and May 2020 when the only access to non-urgent pediatric otolaryngology service was through telemedicine and compared it to in-person visits during the same period in 2019 We compared patient demographics including age, gender, preferred language, zip code of residence and primary insurance plan RESULTS: A total of 1495 visits were conducted through telemedicine from 3/23/2020 to 5/1/2020, and 1983 in-person visits were completed in 2019 There was no difference in patient age and gender The proportions of Spanish speaking families were similar (15 8% in 2019 vs 14 4% in 2020, p=0 96) The percentage of Medi-Cal insured patients (51 4% in 2019 vs 49 8% in 2020, p=0 73) and the mean poverty level (12 6% in 2019 vs 12 2% in 2020, p=0 38) also remained the same Spanish speaking families were statistically more likely to require rescheduling of their telemedicine visits (17 2%) when compared to the overall rescheduling rate of 11 9% (p=0 0083) CONCLUSIONS: We were able to successfully provide access to telemedicine services to our vulnerable populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic Telemedicine is likely to remain an essential mode of delivering patient care going forward It is important to evaluate and identify potential disparities to telemedicine access and proactively implement changes to address these barriers This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"Equal Access to Telemedicine during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pediatric Otolaryngology Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism was reported in patients with COVID-19.

In the extracts, healthy homozygotes (wt/wt), heterozygotes (M/wt), and homozygous carriers of Leiden mutation (M/M) provided median Ct values of 18.5, 19.4/22.0, and 20.9. In the whole blood, Ct values were 25.3 (wt/wt), 24.8/27.2 (M/wt), and 26.9 (M/M). Median Ct values for G20210A in the extracts were 19.6 for homozygotes (wt/wt), and 19.7/20.4 for heterozygous carriers. The whole blood samples provided Ct values of 23.9 in healthy homozygotes and 26.3/27.2 in heterozygotes for G20210A mutation. No homozygous subjects for G20210A and no double heterozygotes (for Leiden and G20210A mutations) were found.

The prognosis of elderly patients is equally impaired in ST-segment elevation (STE) or non-STE (NSTE), and it is markedly worsened by the common presence of multivessel disease (MVD). Given the limited evidence available for elderly patients, it has not yet been established whether, as for younger patients, a complete revascularization strategy in MI patients with MVD should be advocated. We present the design of a dedicated study that will address this research gap. METHODS AND DESIGN: The FIRE trial is a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter, open-label study with blinded adjudicated evaluation of outcomes. Patients aged 75 years and older, with MI (either STE or NSTE), MVD at coronary artery angiography and a clear culprit lesion will be randomized to culprit-only treatment or to physiology-guided complete revascularization. The primary endpoint will be the patient-oriented composite endpoint (POCE) of all cause death, any MI, any stroke, any revascularization at one year. The key secondary endpoint will be the composite of cardiovascular death and MI. Quality of life and physical performance will be evaluated as well. All components of the primary and key secondary outcome will be tested also at 3 and 5 years. The sample size for the study is 1400 patients.

METHODS: A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019.

Actively calling patients to postpone appointments is a labour-intensive process. We were the first ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong to use short message service (SMS) to dispatch messages simultaneously to a large number of patients to offer postponement of appointments. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMS is an effective method to reduce outpatient attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational study reviewing data on SMS messages sent to all patients attending ophthalmology clinics of a tertiary eye centre in Hong Kong. All SMS were sent at least 5 days before the scheduled appointments. The text message included an enquiry hotline for postponement of appointments and offered drug refill. The study included data from February to April 2020. Two hundred patients were invited to take part in a questionnaire on satisfaction level and reason(s) for appointment rescheduling. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,028 SMS were sent. The overall response rate was 23.6%. 14.3% postponed their appointments. This led to an overall 13.9% reduction of clinic attendance. The overall satisfaction was high (96%). The main reason for postponing appointment was worries about infection risk (93.1%). CONCLUSION: SMS was an efficient and cost-effective flow-control method which was well accepted by patients and can reduce outpatient attendance.

Methods: An online cross-sectional study (STRONG study;psychological changes and effects after COVID-19 quarantine in Greece) was conducted from 28 September 2020 (no lockdown restrictions) to 2 November 2020, just before the second lockdown in Greece. Main outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as posttraumatic growth. Results: A total of 860 adults participated in the study. A high proportion of participants did not report any pre-existing health condition (61%), while 334 individuals reported one or more physical or mental health conditions. Overall, 20.2% of the participants reported significant depressive symptoms, and 27.9% reported moderate to high posttraumatic growth. The presence of physical and mental health conditions, either as single diagnosis or as a multimorbidity, was significantly associated with the development of depressive symptomatology (either physical or mental health conditions: OR = 1.12;95% CI, 1.07C1.17, p < 0.001;both physical and mental health conditions: OR = 1.23;95% CI, 1.14C1.33, p < 0.001).

For a better understanding of the evolution of COVID-19 in the world, study on evolution and growth of cases in India could not be avoided. To understand the same, one of the compartment model: Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) is used. Recovery rate and doubling rate of the total reported positive cases in the country had crossed 75% and 25 days, respectively. It is also estimated that there is a strong positive correlation between testing rate and detection of new cases up to 6 million tests per day. Using the SIQR modelling effective reproduction number, epidemic doubling rate and infected to quarantined ratio is determined to check the temporal evolution of the pandemic in the country. Effective reproduction number that was at its peak during first half of the April is gradually converging to 1. It is also estimated using this model that with each detected cases in India, there could be 10-50 undetected cases. Like every mathematical model, this model also has some assumptions. To make this model more robust, a technique with weighted parameter that can avoid a person with a strong immune system to be equally vulnerable to the infection, can be worked out.

The droplet dispersion depends on the surrounding air velocity, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. In a confined space like an elevator, the risk of transmission becomes higher when there is an infected person inside the elevator with other individuals. In this work, a numerical investigation is carried out in a three-dimensional domain resembling an elevator using OpenFoam. Three different modes of air ventilation, viz., quiescent, axial exhaust draft, and exhaust fan, have been considered to investigate the effect of ventilation on droplet transmission for two different climatic conditions (30 [Formula: see text] , 50% relative humidity and 10 [Formula: see text] , 90% relative humidity). The risk assessment is quantified using a risk factor based on the time-averaged droplet count present near the passenger's hand to head region (risky height zone). The risk factor drops from 40% in a quiescent scenario to 0% in an exhaust fan ventilation condition in a hot dry environment. In general, cold humid conditions are safer than hot dry conditions as the droplets settle down quickly below the risky height zone owing to their larger masses maintained by negligible evaporation. However, an exhaust fan renders the domain in a hot dry ambience completely safe (risk factor, 0%) in 5.5 s whereas it takes 7.48 s for a cold humid ambience.","output":"Risk assessment of COVID infection by respiratory droplets from cough for various ventilation scenarios inside an elevator: An OpenFOAM-based computational fluid dynamics analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Endemic and emerging respiratory viruses are a threat to public health, and a robust public health laboratory system is essential to ensure global health security. OBJECTIVE: This program sought to expand molecular laboratory testing capacity to detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens in clinical respiratory specimens collected during disease surveillance and outbreak investigations. METHODS: As a part of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention utilised the equipment and training infrastructure already in place at the World Health Organization National Influenza Centers to expand testing capacity for respiratory viruses in laboratories in GHSA partner countries. This was done through the provision of quality assured reagents, including multiplex platforms and technical guidance for laboratory staff, as well as the assessment of laboratory testing accuracy.

Lenzilumab, a novel anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, neutralizes GM-CSF and demonstrated potential to improve clinical outcomes in a matched case-cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of survival without invasive mechanical ventilation (SWOV), beyond available treatments. METHODS: Hypoxic patients, hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=520), requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized on Day 0 to receive lenzilumab (1800mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259), and available treatments, including remdesivir and/or corticosteroids; and were followed through Day 28. RESULTS: Baseline demographics were comparable between groups: male, 64.7%; mean age, 60.5 years; median CRP, 79.0 mg/L. Patients across both groups received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab improved the primary endpoint, likelihood of SWOV in the mITT population, by 1.54-fold (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.32, p=0.0403). Lenzilumab improved SWOV by 1.91-fold (nominal p=0.0073) and 1.92-fold (nominal p=0.0067) in patients receiving remdesivir or remdesivir and corticosteroids, respectively. A key secondary endpoint of incidence of IMV, ECMO or death was also improved in patients receiving remdesivir (p=0.020) or remdesivir and corticosteroids (p=0.0180). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were similar across both groups. CONCLUSION: Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV in hypoxic COVID-19 patients upon hospitalization, with the greatest benefit observed in patients receiving treatment with remdesivir and corticosteroids.

We combine a model of customer movement with two models of disease transmission: direct exposure when two customers are in close proximity and wake exposure when one customer is in the airflow behind another customer. We find that the effectiveness of some operational interventions is sensitive to the primary mode of transmission. Restricting customer flow to one-way movement is highly effective if direct exposure is the dominant mode of transmission. In particular, the rate of direct transmission under full compliance with one-way movement is less than one-third the rate under two-way movement. Directing customers to follow one-way flow, however, is not effective if wake exposure dominates. We find that two other interventions-reducing the speed variance of customers and throughput control-can be effective whether direct or wake transmission is dominant. We also examine the trade-off between customer throughput and the risk of infection to customers, and we show how the optimal throughput rate drops rapidly as the population prevalence rises.","output":"Retail store customer flow and COVID-19 transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ste24, an integral membrane protein zinc metalloprotease, is found in every kingdom of eukaryotes. It was discovered approximately 20 years ago by yeast genetic screens identifying it as a factor responsible for processing the yeast mating a-factor pheromone. In animals, Ste24 processes prelamin A, a component of the nuclear lamina; mutations in the human ortholog of Ste24 diminish its activity, giving rise to genetic diseases of accelerated aging (progerias). Additionally, lipodystrophy, acquired from the standard highly active antiretroviral therapy used to treat AIDS patients, likely results from off-target interactions of HIV (aspartyl) protease inhibitor drugs with Ste24. Ste24 possesses a novel -barrel structure, consisting of a ring of seven transmembrane -helices enclosing a large (> 12,000 ?(3)) interior volume that contains the active-site and substrate-binding region; this membrane-interior reaction chamber is unprecedented in integral membrane protein structures. Additionally, the surface of the membrane-interior reaction chamber possesses a strikingly large negative electrostatic surface potential, adding additional functional mystery. Recent publications implicate Ste24 as a key factor in several endoplasmic reticulum processes, including the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum, and removal of misfolded proteins from the translocon. Ste24, with its provocative structure, enigmatic mechanism, and recently emergent new biological roles including translocon unclogger and (non-enyzmatic) broad-spectrum viral restriction factor, presents far differently than before 2016, when it was viewed as a CAAX protease responsible for cleavage of prenylated (farnesylated or geranylgeranylated) substrates.

Data were from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Renal Data System. Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25%-100% could result in excess deaths of wait-listed (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119-478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID-19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity. Considering that more than 700 000 Americans have ESRD with 100 000 awaiting a kidney transplant, our highest annual estimate of 478 excess total deaths from postponing kidney transplantation seems modest.","output":"Estimated impact of novel coronavirus-19 and transplant center inactivity on end-stage renal disease-related patient mortality in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) transports Ca2+ by a reaction cycle including phosphorylated intermediates.

Our results show that calmodulin binds to E2P-like states, and during dephosphorylation, the hydrophobicity in the nucleotide-binding pocket decreases and the Ca2+ binding site becomes inaccessible to the extracellular medium.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged  18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2C4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen  2, 3C4, and  5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73C4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period.

Nonetheless, many resource-constrained settings are yet to adopt HIV self-testing (HIVST) into their national HIV programmes. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the association between socio-economic factors and HIVST knowledge amongst South African women. METHOD: We used nationally representative data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. A sample of 8182 women of reproductive age was analysed. The outcome variable was HIVST knowledge. This was measured dichotomously; know versus do not know about HIVST. The multivariable logistic model was used to examine the measures of association, with the level of significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of HIVST knowledge was found to be approximately 24.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.9C26.1) amongst South African women. Women with tertiary education were 3.93 times more likely to have HIVST knowledge, when compared with those with no formal education (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93; 95% CI: 1.37C11.26). Rural residents had a 33% reduction in HIVST knowledge when compared with those residing in urban areas (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.51C0.89). The odds of interaction between the richer and richest women who have good knowledge of HIV infection were 1.88 and 2.24 times more likely to have HIVST knowledge, respectively, when compared with those from the poorest wealth household who have good knowledge of HIV infection.

Several mechanisms, including lung recruitment and better lung ventilation/perfusion matching, make a relevant rational for using PP. However, not all patients maintain the oxygenation improvement after returning to supine position. Nevertheless, no evidence exists that a sustained oxygenation response after PP is associated to outcome in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. We analyzed data from 191 patients affected by COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing PP for clinical reasons. Clinical history, severity scores and respiratory mechanics were analyzed. Patients were classified as responders (&#8805; median PaO2/FiO2 variation) or non-responders (< median PaO2/FiO2 variation) based on the PaO2/FiO2 percentage change between pre-proning and 1 to 3 h after re-supination in the first prone positioning session. Differences among the groups in physiological variables, complication rates and outcome were evaluated. A competing risk regression analysis was conducted to evaluate if PaO2/FiO2 response after the first pronation cycle was associated to liberation from mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The median PaO2/FiO2 variation after the first PP cycle was 49 [19-100%] and no differences were found in demographics, comorbidities, ventilatory treatment and PaO2/FiO2 before PP between responders (96/191) and non-responders (95/191). Despite no differences in ICU length of stay, non-responders had a higher rate of tracheostomy (70.5% vs 47.9, P = 0.008) and mortality (53.7% vs 33.3%, P = 0.006), as compared to responders. Moreover, oxygenation response after the first PP was independently associated to liberation from mechanical ventilation at 28 days and was increasingly higher being higher the oxygenation response to PP. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained oxygenation improvement after first PP session is independently associated to improved survival and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Sustained oxygenation improvement after first prone positioning is associated with liberation from mechanical ventilation and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urolithins are microbial metabolites derived from berries and pomegranate fruits, which display anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-aging activities.

METHODS: We interviewed 124 psychiatric outpatients with MDE using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II Disorders, the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV), and about past (hypo)manic episodes, and stratified them according to the principal diagnosis into subcohorts of major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 50), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 43), and borderline personality disorder (BPD, n = 31). We quantified (hypo)manic symptoms using a novel semi-structured interview (MIXed symptoms during MDE, MIX-MDE) with good psychometric qualities. RESULTS: The subcohorts did not differ in MDE severity. They differed significantly in some (hypo)manic symptoms being present on most days in 24% of MDD, 30% of BD, and 42% of BPD subcohort, but only 5% of the BD subcohort fulfilled the DSM-5 mixed features.

However, COVID19 complicated this process and the optimal approach to achieve this introduction remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to develop an online case-based approach as the basis for donor introduction to medical students based on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports. MRI scans of 16 body donors were assessed by a radiologist and observations were uploaded to a web-based DICOM viewer (www.rad3d.com). A list of learning objectives were generated for each donor and radiology reports were constructed based on: chief complaints, medical history, radiology and pathology that were reviewed prior to the class. Within the lab and following COVID19 restriction policy, students read through the radiology reports and viewed the augmented reality (AR) visualizations of the MRI scans using z-space computers providing additional dissection team interactions. Finally, surface anatomy exercises were undertaken that corresponded to the primary pathology providing a direct interaction with the donor. This process included Sketchfab and other links to underscore anatomical correlations (Figure 1). A survey was conducted to assess student perceptions of the experience. The study design comprised a voluntary survey tool to assess student level of anxiety and whether the online approach was effective. Response scales were either bimodal or Likert-base (5 scale) and analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Follow up open ended questions were also presented to the students. The response rate was 33/80 (41.25%). Most students (82.7%) felt anxious first, but the anxiety decreased in time (60.7%). They mostly accomplished the tasks (surface exercises 97%; reviewing MRIs 87.9%) and found surface exercises useful in terms of reducing anxiety (90.6%), and initiating team work (100%). A total of 79.3% of the students found MR useful for learning radiology (Table 1). More than half of the students (55.6%) indicated that the first encounter was not as they expected and stated that they thought it would be more intimidating. Several emotions were indicated such as: confused, uncomfortable, somber, excited, grateful, thankful, professional. They all agreed that using a case based approach as an introductory laboratory prior to first dissection is useful. There was one prominent suggestion almost all students stated: video resources prior to the lab.

Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality.

REVIEW METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried and abstracts screened independently by 2 investigators. We included studies evaluating the efficacy of OT for PVOD and excluded studies evaluating pharmacologic interventions or olfactory loss from other causes.

However, in two recent cases, the Court in brief orders declined applications for emergency relief to block state vaccine mandates, and the petitioners have vowed to continue to pursue these cases. This Article explores how the seemingly sudden onset of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with its protracted duration, has occasioned both emergency and enduring state regulation of religious behavior in a way that exposes deep divides in our societys views of the proper exercise of the states police powers to promote public health and safety, and of the protections afforded by the Free Exercise Clause. Part I of this article considers state vaccination jurisprudence in the United States, beginning with the seminal 1905 case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, illustrating that federal and state courts have consistently deferred to states exercise of their police powers in mandating vaccination, and have held that states need not offer religious exemptions to vaccination. Part II of this article analyzes the two recent cases brought by health care workers who petitioned the Supreme Court for emergency relief from vaccine mandates. This Part focuses on the dissenting Justices view that a state must offer a religious exemption to vaccination if it offers a secular one. Part III explores how these dissenting justices developed their interpretation through cases relating to restrictions on religious gatherings, thereby changing Free Exercise jurisprudence significantly during the pandemic era. Finally, Part IV critiques the view that a state violates the Free Exercise Clause where it permits a secular but not a religious exemption to a state vaccine mandate, and explains how the Supreme Court can distinguish the cases concerning pandemic gatherings from cases involving vaccine mandates, so as to uphold state vaccine mandates as constitutional.","output":"First Amendment Challenges to State Vaccine Mandates: Why the U.S. Supreme Court Should Hold that the Free Exercise Clause Does not Require Religious Exemptions (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumour virology was born with the discovery by Peyton Rous in 1911 of a filterable agent in chicken cellular extracts that caused neoplasia in healthy chickens.

The model, which was rigorously analysed and parametrized using COVID-19 data published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), was used to assess the community-wide impact of various control and mitigation strategies in some jurisdictions within Nigeria (notably the states of Kano and Lagos, and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja). Numerical simulations of the model showed that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in Nigeria using moderate levels of social-distancing strategy in the jurisdictions and in the entire nation. Although the use of face masks in public can significantly reduce COVID-19 in Nigeria, its use, as a sole intervention strategy, may fail to lead to a substantial reduction in disease burden. Such substantial reduction is feasible in the jurisdictions (and the entire Nigerian nation) if the public face mask use strategy is complemented with a social-distancing strategy. The community lockdown measures implemented in Nigeria on March 30, 2020 need to be maintained for at least three to four months to lead to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country.

The parameter values of these ODE models are typically unknown and need to be estimated based on accessible data. In order to describe realistic pandemic scenarios with strongly varying situations, these model parameters need to be assumed as time-dependent. While parameter estimation for the typical case of time-constant parameters does not pose larger issues, the determination of time-dependent parameters, e.g.~the transition rates of compartmental models, remains notoriously difficult, in particular since the function class of these time-dependent parameters is unknown. In this work, we present a novel method which utilizes the Augmented Kalman Smoother in combination with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to simultaneously estimate all time-dependent parameters in an SIRD compartmental model. This approach only requires incidence data, but no prior knowledge on model parameters or any further assumptions on the function class of the time-dependencies. In contrast to other approaches for the estimation of the time-dependent reproduction number, no assumptions on the parameterization of the serial interval distribution are required. With this method, we are able to adequately describe COVID-19 data in Germany and to give non-parametric model-based time course estimates for the effective reproduction number.","output":"Non-parametric model-based estimation of the effective reproduction number for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article summarizes the state of the art in vaccine research against parasitic helminths in sheep and cattle.

Computational methods for imputing the missing values using RNA expression data usually allow only for imputations of proteins measured in at least some of the samples. In silico methods for comprehensively estimating abundances across all proteins are still missing. RESULTS We propose a novel method using deep learning to extrapolate the observed protein expression values in label-free MS experiments to all proteins, leveraging gene functional annotations and RNA measurements as key predictive attributes. We tested our method on four datasets, including human cell lines and human and mouse tissues. Our method predicts the protein expression values with average R2 scores between 0.46 and 0.54, which is significantly better than predictions based on correlations using the RNA expression data alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived models can be \\"transferred\\" across experiments and species. For instance, the model derived from human tissues gave a R2 = 0.51 when applied to mouse tissue data. We conclude that protein abundances generated in label free MS experiments can be computationally predicted using functional annotated attributes and can be used to highlight aberrant protein abundance values.

TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position.

A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences.

Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05).

Methods: In most of published studies T-cell immunity to the new coronavirus is assessed using peptides corresponding to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes, or with peptide pools covering various parts of the viral proteins. Here, we determined the level of CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T-cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents by stimulating PBMCs collected 1 to 6 months after recovery with sucrose gradient-purified live SARS-CoV-2. IFN production by the central and effector memory helper and cytotoxic T cells was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining assay and flow cytometry. Results: Stimulation of PBMCs with live SARS-CoV-2 revealed IFN-producing T-helper effector memory cells with CD4(+)CD45RA(?)CCR7(?) phenotype, which persisted in circulation for up to 6 month after COVID-19. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-secreting cytotoxic effector memory T cells were found at significant levels only shortly after the disease, but rapidly decreased over time.

The COVID-19 pandemic, with its complexity and global reach, created unprecedented challenges for public health and highlighted societal vulnerability to hazardous hot weather. In this study, we used data from a three-wave nationally representative survey of 3036 American adults to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected extreme heat vulnerability during the summer of 2020. We used mixed effects models to examine the roles of socio-demographic characteristics and pandemic-related factors in the distribution of negative heat effects and experiences across the United States. The survey findings show that over a quarter of the US population experienced heat-related symptoms during the summer of 2020. Mixed effects models demonstrate that among all socio-economic groups, those who were most vulnerable were women, those in low-income households, unemployed or on furlough, and people who identify as Hispanic or Latino or as other non-white census categories (including Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multi-racial US residents). The study findings indicate that millions of people in the US had difficulty coping with or responding to extreme heat because of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited access to cooling as well as COVID-19 related social isolation played a major role in adverse heat health effects. Geographically, the South and the West of the US stood out in terms of self-reported negative heat effects. Overall, the study suggests that the intersection of two health hazardsextreme heat and coronavirus SARS-CoV2amplified existing systemic vulnerabilities and expanded the demographic range of people vulnerable to heat stress.","output":"Compounding hazards and intersecting vulnerabilities: experiences and responses to extreme heat during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with hyperleukocytosis is associated to high early mortality rates and needs aggressive treatment. Induction chemotherapy (ICH), leukapheresis and hydroxyurea (HU) are the most frequent used leukoreductive strategies. Delay in ICH is very common, leukapheresis is not widely available and hydroxyurea and leukapheresis do not modify early mortality rates. Therefore alternative strategies to leukoreduce patients with AML and hyperleukocytosis are needed. Vinblastine is widely available, cheap, with preclinical activity and promising results in relapsed AML. We explored the leukoreductive power of a single dose of vinblastine in patients with newly diagnosed AML and hyperleukocytosis. Patients and methods We conducted a prospective pilot study that included consecutive patients with newly diagnosed non-M3 AML, aged 16 to 60 years, and with a WBC 50,000/L at time of presentation and in whom immediate ICH with 7+3 was not possible because of hospital limitations (i.e. delay in ICH drug availability). We excluded patients with PML/RAR-alfa rearrangement and/or t(15;17), poor performance status (ECOG >2), any preceding chemotherapy, organic dysfunction (defined as a modified Marshall score 2) or pregnancy. After diagnostic confirmation, a single dose of vinblastine at 6 mg/m2 i.v. was administered. We documented leukocytes (WBC) and number of blasts on the day of vinblastine administration (0h) and 48 hours later. We represented the achieved leukoreduction with boxplots and compared the absolute reduction in WBC (delta WBC) and blasts (delta blasts) after vinblastine administration. We compared the leukoreductive power of vinblastine to other leukoreductive strategies (HU, leukapheresis). We calculated toxicities (grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), median length of hospitalization and parental antibiotics, and overall survival (OS). We documented cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukostasis and tumor lysis syndrome. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and our local ethics committee. Results A total of 11 patients were enrolled in the study, seven were men (63.6%), with a median age of 48 (21-78) years. Median follow-up was 21 days (2-833 days). The most frequent morphologic subtype was M4 (3, 27.3%), M5 (2, 18.2%) and M2 (2, 18.2%). Cytogenetics were obtained in three cases (27.3%) and all of them were classified as intermediate risk. Forty eight hours after vinblastine administration the WBC lowered from 122x109/L (50.1-380) to 47.3x109/L (22.1-170) representing a 54% (26.7-84.2) decrese (p=0.0001) (figure 1) while blasts number lowered from 204 x 109/L (47.8-361) to 6.4 x 109/L (0-1.6) representing a 85.7% (75-100) decrease (p=0.005) (figure 1). In Table 1 we compare our results with other strategies. All patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. There were no cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukostasis or tumor lysis syndrome. Severe infections (grade III-IV) occurred in 8 patients (two patients presented neutropenic colitis, five with severe pneumonia, and one SARS-COV2). Four patients presented septic shock and died during induction therapy. Median length of hospitalization and parental antibiotics were 19 days (2-30) and 7 days (range, 2-24), respectively. A CR was achieved in 4 patients (36.4%) after one induction cycle. One patient presented refractory disease and five died before response evaluation. One patient relapsed at 16 months of follow-up. Median OS was 11 months (0-31.8). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed in 1 patient. Conclusion We documented a marked reduction in both WBC and blasts after 48 hours of vinblastine administration. Our study suggests that the leukoreductive power of a single dose of vinblastine is similar to HU and leukapheresis in patients with AML with hyperleukocytosis. Vinblastine is a widely available, cheap and myelotoxic drug that could extend the arsenal to treat newly diagnosed AML with hyperleukocytosis.

AIM: To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. METHOD: Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic multivariate regression models adjusted for age and sex were constructed to analyse independent predictive factors associated with death, ICU admission and hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50% female, 115 (35.7%) aged  65 years): 123 (38.2) were health workers (doctors, nurses, auxiliaries). Predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.07), male sex (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.55 to 5.82), autoimmune disease (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.00 to 7.84), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.41 to 6.13), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.28 to 6.90), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.22 to 6.98) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.22 to 4.68). Myalgia or arthralgia (OR = 0.31; 95%CI = 0.12 to 0.70) was protective factor against ICU admission and death. Predictors of hospitalization were chills (OR = 5.66; 95%CI = 1.68 to 23.49), fever (OR = 3.33; 95%CI = 1.89 to 5.96), dyspnoea (OR = 2.92; 95%CI = 1.62 to 5.42), depression (OR = 6.06; 95%CI = 1.54 to 40.42), lymphopenia (OR = 3.48; 95%CI = 1.67 to 7.40) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 3.27; 95%CI = 1.59 to 7.18). Anosmia (OR = 0.42; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.90) was the only significant protective factor for hospitalization after adjusting for age and sex.

HYPOTHESIS: PVCs may increase the adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes in pregnant women. METHODS: Six thousand one hundred and forty-eight pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in our center between 2017 and 2019 in the study. The average PVC burden was determined by calculating the number of PVCs in total beats. Those who had a PVC burden >0.5% were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of adverse fetal or neonatal events. The adverse outcomes were compared between the groups to assess the impact of PVCs on pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.68%) women with a PVC burden >0.5% were recorded. Among them, 17 adverse events (12 cases) were documented, which was significantly higher than that among women without PVCs (11.65% vs. 2.93%, p < .01). The median PVC burden among pregnant women with PVCs was 2.84% (1.02%-6.1%). Furthermore, compared with that of the women without adverse events, the median PVC burden of women with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes was significantly higher (9.02% vs. 2.30%, p < .01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that not the LVEF, heart rate and bigeminy, but only the PVC burden was associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs (OR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.11-1.61], p < .01).

Some institutions adopted online learning but also maintained face-to-face (F2F) laboratories when COVID-19 restrictions began to ease. Here, the effectiveness of the online learning approach in comparison with F2F learning is explored. The percentage difference in performance for students who took the online introductory physics course, Physics for Scientists and Engineers, versus that of students simultaneously taking the same course F2F is reported. This is done both across different sections taught by different instructors, and for the same course taught online versus F2F by the same professor. Furthermore, a short survey was conducted to assess the student learning experience and opinion about online and F2F learning. The results show equal or better overall performance for online learning with 4.2% higher performance when comparing results across different sections taught by different instructors. A similar 6.1% performance improvement was seen when comparing results across different sections taught by the same instructor. In contrast with the performance outcomes, the survey results indicate that about 72% of students prefer F2F compared to online learning. The findings provide a useful reference as many institutions and programs transition back to more standard F2F or hybrid learning modes.

The aim was to determine whether new-onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres. Consecutive patients positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups. New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77-165.4, P = 0.003)]. COVID-19 patients with new-onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients without STDs (52.6  17.2 vs. 67.4  15.1, P < 0.001). Amongst COVID-19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction.

However, the effectiveness of COVID-19 inactivated vaccines in pregnant women is still unknown. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of CoronaVac against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 in pregnant women in Brazil. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative design study in all pregnant women aged 18C49 years with COVID-19-related symptoms in Brazil from March 15, 2021, to October 03, 2021, linking records of negative and positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to national vaccination records. We also linked records of test-positive cases with notifications of severe, hospitalised or fatal COVID-19. Using logistic regression, we estimated the adjusted odds ratio and VE against symptomatic COVID-19 and against severe COVID-19 by comparing vaccine status in test-negative subjects to test-positive symptomatic cases and severe cases. RESULTS: Of the 19,838 tested pregnant women, 7424 (37.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 and 588 (7.9%) had severe disease. Only 83% of pregnant women who received the first dose of CoronaVac completed the vaccination scheme. A single dose of the CoronaVac vaccine was not effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

Detection and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses require separate and complex workflows that rely on highly-specialized facilities, personnel, and reagents. To date, no method can rapidly diagnose multiple viral infections and determine variants in a high-throughput manner. Methods We describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification-based sequencing and real-time analysis of multiple viral genomes, termed NIRVANA. It can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human adenovirus, and human coronavirus, and monitor mutations for up to 96 samples in real-time. Findings NIRVANA showed high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in 70 clinical samples with a detection limit of 20 viral RNA copies per l of extracted nucleic acid. It also detected the influenza A co-infection in two samples. The variant analysis results of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples mirror the epidemiology of COVID-19. Additionally, NIRVANA could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (an omnipresent virus and water quality indicator) in municipal wastewater samples. Conclusions NIRVANA provides high-confidence detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on the fly.

Treatment with ACEI/ARB (combined and individually) had no effect on mortality (OR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.17-2.26; P = .486), heart failure (OR, 1.37; 95%CI, 0.39-4.77; P = .622), hospitalization rate (OR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.45-1.64; P = .638), ICU admission (OR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.30-2.50; P = .798), or major acute cardiovascular events (OR, 1.06; 95%CI, 0.39-2.83; P = .915). This neutral effect remained in a subgroup analysis of patients requiring hospitalization. Conclusions: Previous treatment with ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19 had no effect on mortality, heart failure, requirement for hospitalization, or ICU admission. Withdrawal of ACEI/ARB in patients testing positive for COVID-19 would not be justified, in line with current recommendations of scientific societies and government agencies.","output":"Impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on COVID-19 in a western population.

Currently, there are no official guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a licensed antiviral treatment against HIV and has shown activity against other coronaviruses. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we review the evidence of the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as a potential treatment candidate against COVID-19. METHOD: This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020182067). A systematic search of the literature for the observational and randomized controlled trial was conducted in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar through May 2nd, 2020. Two reviewers independently searched and selected. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Jadad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment tool, and National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 1,965 articles were screened from which 6 articles were selected. Of 6 articles that were included in this study, 4 reported no significant benefit in clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to standard care of treatment, while 2 studies reported otherwise. Lopinavir/ritonavir was also not associated with a reduction of 28-day mortality rate as reported by 1 included study. Most included studies reported gastrointestinal symptoms as side effects from lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. CONCLUSION: There is not yet enough evidence to support the regular use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID19.

Methods: Forty participants with NSLBP were randomly divided into the WBV group and the control group. The sEMG signals of deltoid, erector spines (ES), multifidus (MF), rectus abdominis (RA), and transversus abdominus/internal oblique muscles (TrA/IO) were recorded before and after the intervention in the weight-shifting task. The relative activation time of each muscle was calculated. Results: In the WBV group, the relative activation time of bilateral MF and bilateral TrA/IO was significantly reduced on shoulder flexion (right MF: P=0.014; left MF: P=0.011; right TrA/IO: P=0.008; left TrA/IO: P=0.026). As for shoulder abduction, except for the left TrA/IO and the left RA, the relative activation time of other muscles was significantly reduced (right ES: P=0.001; left ES: P < 0.001; right MF: P=0.001; left MF: P=0.009; right TrA/IO: P < 0.001; right RA: P=0.001). In the control group, there was no significant difference in the relative activation time of each muscle before and after the intervention (P > 0.05).

In this study, we test the hypothesis that metrics derived from a single wrist sensor worn at home provide accurate, reliable, and interpretable information about neurological disease severity in children with A-T. A total of 15 children with A-T and 15 age- and sex-matched controls wore a sensor with a triaxial accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 1 week at home. Activity intensity measures, derived from the sensor data, were compared with in-person neurological evaluation on the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) and performance on a validated computer mouse task. Children with A-T were inactive the same proportion of each day as controls but produced more low intensity movements (p < 0.01; Cohens d = 1.48) and fewer high intensity movements (p < 0.001; Cohens d = 1.71). The range of activity intensities was markedly reduced in A-T compared to controls (p < 0.0001; Cohens d = 2.72). The activity metrics correlated strongly with arm, gait, and total clinical severity (r: 0.71C0.87; p < 0.0001), correlated with specific computer task motor features (r: 0.67C0.92; p < 0.01), demonstrated high reliability (r: 0.86C0.93; p < 0.00001), and were not significantly influenced by age in the healthy control group.

Advanced age is also a recognised risk factor for adverse outcomes with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) which continues to wreak havoc on global populations. This study aimed to assess the safety of bariatric surgery (BS) in this particular age group during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the younger cohort. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international study of patients who underwent BS between 1/05/2020 and 31/10/2020. Patients were divided into two groups  patients  65-years-old (Group I) and patients < 65-years-old (Group II). The two groups were compared for 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: There were 149 patients in Group 1 and 6923 patients in Group II. The mean age, preoperative weight, and BMI were 67.6  2.5 years, 119.5  24.5 kg, and 43  7 in Group I and 39.8  11.3 years, 117.720.4 kg, and 43.7  7 in Group II, respectively. Approximately, 95% of patients in Group 1 had at least one co-morbidity compared to 68% of patients in Group 2 (p = < 0.001). The 30-day morbidity was significantly higher in Group I (11.4%) compared to Group II (6.6%) (p = 0.022). However, the 30-day mortality and COVID-19 infection rates were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a higher complication rate in those  65 years of age compared to those < 65 years old.

The objective of the study is to design and validate the Scale of Worry for Contagion of COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19). METHOD: The study had a descriptive cross-sectional design. The population were young people and adults who resided in the cities of Lima and Callao (Per) during the declaration of the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period from March 16 to 27, 2020, who were recruited through a non-probability sample. The PRE-COVID-19, the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 and a single item were applied to measure the general perception of health. The scales were shared using a Google form through social networks. An internal consistency reliability analysis and structural equation models were performed, specifically confirmatory factor analysis. The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles that guide the ethical practice of online studies were followed. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixteen young people and adults from Lima and Callao (200 men and 616 women; mean age 28.40, SD 7.10) participated. The results show a one-dimensional model with satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices: &#967;2 (9)=52.00; CFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.09 [0.07, 0.12]; WRMR=0.85.

However, little is known about the impact of cancer status on presentation and outcome. Here, we report on the association between cancer status and survival in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARSCoV- 2 during the height of pandemic in New York City. Methods: Of the 6,724 patients who were hospitalized at NYU Langone Health (3/16/20 -7/31/20) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 580 had either active cancer (n = 221) or a history of cancer (n = 359). Patients were classified as having active malignancy if they either received treatment within six months of their COVID-19 diagnosis or they had measurable disease documented at the time of their hospitalization. Patients were categorized as having a history of cancer if there was no evidence of measurable disease or there were no treatments administered within six months of their COVID-19 diagnosis. We compared the baseline clinicodemographic characteristics and hospital courses of the two groups, and the relationship between cancer status and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality. Results: There was no differences between the two groups in their baseline laboratory results associated with COVID- 19 infection, incidence of venous thromboembolism, or incidence of severe COVID- 19. Active cancer status was not associated with the rate of ICU admission (P =0.307) or use of IMV (P = 0.236), but was significantly associated with worse all-cause mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis with ORs of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.04-2.09;P = 0.028) and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.12- 2.63;P = 0.014), respectively. Conclusions: Active cancer patients had worse survival outcomes compared to patients with a history of cancer despite similar COVID-19 disease characteristics in the two groups. Our data suggest that cancer care should continue with minimal interruptions during the pandemic to bring about response and remission as soon as possible. Additionally, these findings support the growing body of evidence that malignancy portends worse COVID-19 prognosis, and demonstrate that the risk may even apply to those without active disease.","output":"Outcomes for hospitalized cancer patients with COVID-19 during the height of pandemic in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) experience no or mild symptoms, some individuals can develop severe illness and may die, particularly older people and those with underlying medical problems. Providing evidence-based interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection has become more urgent with the spread of more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), and the potential psychological toll imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers. When it comes to the transmission of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, workplaces should first consider control measures that can potentially have the most significant impact. According to the hierarchy of controls, one should first consider elimination (and substitution), then engineering controls, administrative controls, and lastly, personal protective equipment (PPE). OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of interventions in non-healthcare-related workplaces to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to other interventions, or no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), Clinicaltrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 14 September 2021. We will conduct an update of this review in six months. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised control trials (RCT) and planned to include non-randomised studies of interventions. We included adult workers, both those who come into close contact with clients or customers (e.g. public-facing employees, such as cashiers or taxi drivers), and those who do not, but who could be infected by co-workers. We excluded studies involving healthcare workers. We included any intervention to prevent or reduce workers' exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace, defining categories of intervention according to the hierarchy of hazard controls, i.e. elimination; engineering controls; administrative controls; personal protective equipment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or other respiratory viruses), SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, and absenteeism from work. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, quality of life, hospitalisation, and uptake, acceptability, or adherence to strategies. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias, and GRADE methods to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Elimination of exposure interventions We included one study examining an intervention that focused on elimination of hazards. This study is an open-label, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial, conducted in England in 2021. The study compared standard 10-day self-isolation after contact with an infected person to a new strategy of daily rapid antigen testing and staying at work if the test is negative (test-based attendance). The trialists hypothesised that this would lead to a similar rate of infections, but lower COVID-related absence. Staff (N = 11,798) working at 76 schools were assigned to standard isolation, and staff (N = 12,229) at 86 schools to the test-based attendance strategy. The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of symptomatic PCR-positive SARS-COV-2 infection rate ratio ((RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.21; 1 study, very low-certainty evidence)). The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of any PCR-positive SARS-COV-2 infection (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.21; 1 study, very low-certainty evidence). COVID-related absenteeism rates were 3704 absence days in 566,502 days-at-risk (6.5 per 1000 days at risk) in the control group and 2932 per 539,805 days-at-risk (5.4 per 1000 days at risk) in the intervention group (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.25). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded to low, due to imprecision. Uptake of the intervention was 71 % in the intervention group, but not reported for the control intervention. The trial did not measure other outcomes, SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, all-cause mortality, quality of life, and hospitalisation. We found one ongoing RCT about screening in schools, using elimination of hazard strategies. Personal protective equipment We found one ongoing non-randomised study on the effects of closed face shields to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Other intervention categories We did not find studies in the other intervention categories. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether a test-based attendance policy affects rates of PCR-postive SARS-CoV-2 infection (any infection; symptomatic infection) compared to standard 10-day self-isolation amongst school and college staff. Test-based attendance policy may result in little to no difference in absence rates compared to standard 10-day self-isolation. As a large part of the population is exposed in the case of a pandemic, an apparently small relative effect that would not be worthwhile from the individual perspective may still affect many people, and thus, become an important absolute effect from the enterprise or societal perspective. The included study did not report on any other primary outcomes of our review, i.e. SARS-CoV-2-related mortality and adverse events. No completed studies were identified on any other interventions specified in this review, but two eligible studies are ongoing. More controlled studies are needed on testing and isolation strategies, and working from home, as these have important implications for work organisations.","output":"Workplace interventions to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of healthcare settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has changed our lives forever.

Thereafter, based on drug-likeness and Lipinski's rules, 44 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of the viral-host attachment site of the S protein. Corresponding ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were measured. Furthermore, four novel inhibitors were designed and assessed computationally for efficacy. Comparative analysis showed the screened compounds in this study maintain better results than the proposed mother compounds, VE607 and SSAA09E2. The four designed novel lead compounds possessed more fascinating output without deviating from any of Lipinski's rules. They also showed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score was 0.56 and 1.81 compared with VE607 and SSAA09E2, respectively. All the screened compounds and novel compounds showed promising ADMET properties. Among them, the compound AMTM-02 was the best candidate, with a docking score of -7.5 kcal/mol.

Research has shown that older patients interpret nurses communication messages during the clinical encounter. This article conceptualizes older adults interpretation of and need for nonverbal communication (NVC) to enhance patient-centered communication advocated by the World Health Organization. The Corbin and Strauss (2015) inductive Grounded Theory approach was used to collect data from 3 hospital units in Cameroon using in-depth interviews with eight older adults, thirteen nurses, and four student nurses between July 2018 and January 2020. Open coding, axial coding, and selective coding were used for analysis, which reveals that interpretations of NVC can be positive or negative. It means that older adults view nurses either as angels or as difficult persons, depending on the nurses positive or negative NVC and behaviors. These interpretations lead to consequences ranging from a preference for some nurses to noncompliance with care. The results further show that older adults need active listening, humor, and affection from nurses. Information regarding older adults interpretation of and need for NVC can be used to improve curriculum content and to develop skills in and awareness of NVC with older adults.

However, it is unclear to what extent systemic cancer therapy was impacted by COVID-19 in countries with relatively low COVID-19 infection rates. We examined changes in systemic cancer therapy in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a national observational study using de-identified records of government-subsidised cancer medicines dispensed to a random 10% sample of Australians between January 2017 to December 2020. We reported monthly dispensing and initiation rates of antineoplastic (chemo-, immuno- and targeted therapy), endocrine and supportive medicines per 100,000 population. We reported monthly discontinuation rates (defined as 90 days gap between cancer medicine dispensings) per 1,000 people treated. We used interrupted time series analysis to examine changes during times of increased COVID-19 risk and related public health measures (March, April and July 2020). FINDINGS: Between January 2017 and December 2020, 1,011,255 cancer medicines were dispensed to 51,515 people. Overall, there were no reductions in antineoplastic dispensing or initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, we observed a temporary increase of 39/100,000 (95% CI: 14 to 65/100,000) in antineoplastic dispensing, driven by immunotherapy and targeted therapy. In April 2020, we observed a temporary decrease in chemotherapy initiation (-2/100,000, 95% CI: -4 to -1/100,000) and temporary increase in discontinuation of all antineoplastic medicines (35/1,000, 95% CI: 20 to 51/1,000), but these changes were not sustained. INTERPRETATION: The effective control of COVID-19 in Australia appears to have mitigated the initial impact of COVID-19 on systemic cancer therapy. We observed only small and temporary changes in the use of some cancer medicines early in the pandemic.

HH complete adherence rate (HHCAR), HH partial adherence rate (HHPAR) and HH total adherence rate (HHTAR) were analyzed. Profession-specific HHTAR and moment-specific HHTAR (for each WHO moment) were also calculated. RESULTS: : HHCAR, HHPAR and HHTAR were found as 30.8%, 34.5% and 65.3% respectively. There was a significant increase in the monthly HHTAR from 26.7% to 68.4% (P<0.001).The profession-specific HHAR was found to be highest among doctors (67.5%) and nurses (66.4%) compared to ancillary staff (i.e, attenders and sweepers) (57.5%). As the HHTAR increases there is a significant decrease in device associated infection (DAI) rate from 24.7 to 11.5 per 1,000 device days.

Weakness was systematically assessed in two of the eight studies, concerning patients with severe asthma, with a reported frequency of 36 and 70 %, respectively. Electrophysiologic and histologic abnormalities consisted of both peripheral nerve and muscle involvement and were frequently reported, even in non-selected ICU patients. In a population of patients mechanically ventilated for more than 5 days, electrophysiologic abnormalities were reported in 76 % of cases. Two studies showed a clinically important increase (5 and 9 days, respectively) in duration of mechanical ventilation and a mortality twice as high in patients with critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities, compared to those without. Conclusions: Prospective studies of ICU-acquired neuromuscular abnormalities include a small number of patients with various electrophysiologic findings but insufficiently reported clinical correlations. Evaluation of risk factors for these disorders and studies examining their contribution to weaning difficulties and long-term disability are needed.","output":"Acquired neuromuscular disorders in critically ill patients: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in antiviral host defense. Although SP-D shows a preference for glucose/maltose, the protein also recognizes d-mannose and a variety of mannose-rich microbial ligands. This latter preference prompted an examination of the mechanisms of mannose recognition, particularly as they relate to high-mannose viral glycans. Trimeric neck plus carbohydrate recognition domains from human SP-D (hNCRD) preferred alpha1-2-linked dimannose (DM) over the branched trimannose (TM) core, alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 DM, or D-mannose. Previous studies have shown residues flanking the carbohydrate binding site can fine-tune ligand recognition. A mutant with valine at 343 (R343V) showed enhanced binding to mannan relative to wild type and R343A. No alteration in affinity was observed for D-mannose or for alpha1-3- or alpha1-6-linked DM; however, substantially increased affinity was observed for alpha1-2 DM. Both proteins showed efficient recognition of linear and branched subdomains of high-mannose glycans on carbohydrate microarrays, and R343V showed increased binding to a subset of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic analysis of an R343V complex with 1,2-DM showed a novel mode of binding. The disaccharide is bound to calcium by the reducing sugar ring, and a stabilizing H-bond is formed between the 2-OH of the nonreducing sugar ring and Arg349. Although hNCRDs show negligible binding to influenza A virus (IAV), R343V showed markedly enhanced viral neutralizing activity. Hydrophobic substitutions for Arg343 selectively blocked binding of a monoclonal antibody (Hyb 246-05) that inhibits IAV binding activity. Our findings demonstrate an extended ligand binding site for mannosylated ligands and the significant contribution of the 343 side chain to specific recognition of multivalent microbial ligands, including high-mannose viral glycans.","output":"Recognition of mannosylated ligands and influenza A virus by human surfactant protein D: contributions of an extended site and residue 343."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020. On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.","output":"Epidemiologa de COVID-19 en Mxico: del 27 de febrero al 30 de abril de 2020./ Epidemiologa de COVID-19 en Mxico: del 27 de febrero al 30 de abril de 2020./ Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Mexico: from the 27th of February to the 30th of April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence studies to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population and subgroups are key for evaluating mitigation and vaccination policies and for understanding the spread of the disease both on the national level and for comparison with the international community.

Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTCPCR) on lung sections was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers. Results The typical gross pathological change in the lungs was diffuse haemorrhage on the lung surface. Histopathological examination revealed serous, fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli, with capillary engorgement and some capillary microthrombosis. The pulmonary alveoli were thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline-membrane formation; fibrinoid material and erythrocytes were present in alveolar spaces. There were thromboemboli in some bronchial arterioles. Haemorrhagic necrosis and reduced numbers of lymphocytes were observed in lymph nodes and spleen.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Horses (n = 26) having nephrosplenic space obliteration using prosthetic mesh. METHODS Horses undergoing mesh obliteration between January 2006 and May 2013 were included. A Proxplast? mesh was secured to the nephrosplenic space with titanium helical coils in standing horses using laparoscopic technique. Perioperative data were obtained from the medical record and by telephone followup. Tests of proportion were used to compare the study population to the hospital colic population. Occurrence of colic within 1 year of obliteration was compared between horses where the diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy and those diagnosed by abdominal palpation per rectum using a Fisher's exact test. RESULTS All 26 horses undergoing mesh obliteration during the study period survived to discharge. Long term followup was available for 25 horses, with 23 returning to their previous level of function, and 21 alive at the time of followup. Cause of death was not associated with the surgical procedure in any case. Geldings and Warmbloods were overrepresented compared to the hospital colic population. Ten horses (38%) demonstrated colic after mesh obliteration. All 10 horses were examined by a veterinarian and none were diagnosed with recurrence of nephrosplenic entrapment. CONCLUSION Mesh obliteration of the nephrosplenic space is an effective alternative to suture closure for preventing nephrosplenic entrapment of the large colon in horses.

However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to COVID-19.","output":"Tobacco, but Not Nicotine and Flavor-Less Electronic Cigarettes, Induces ACE2 and Immune Dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In their paper, Stelnicki and Carleton (2021) highlight both the findings of their 2019 survey of nurses' mental health (Stelnicki et al. 2020) and more recent literature published during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The reasons for this are complex and multidimensional, relating to social upheaval, disrupted schooling, mental and physical health issues and societal stigmatisation. Previous studies across several countries have demonstrated that they are significantly less likely to participate in higher education and more likely to withdraw early. However, little is currently known about their outcomes after graduation. This paper therefore explores the initial outcomes for the 1,010 full-time students identified as care-experienced within the cohort graduating from an undergraduate degree programme in the UK in 2016/17the most recent year for which data are available. They were found to be slightly more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be in work (and particularly professional work) than their peers, but, conversely, more likely to be studying. These differences largely disappeared once background educational and demographic factors were controlled. The paper discusses the relationship between care-experience and other sites of inequality, concluding that care-experienced graduates are crucially over-represented in groups that are disadvantaged in the graduate labour markete.g. by ethnicity, disability or educational history. This intersectional inequality largely explains their lower graduate outcomes. While there are important limitations with the data available, this speaks for the transformational potential of higher education in enabling care-experienced graduates to transcend childhood adversity.

Data pertaining to the growth of publications, citation metrics, the most active countries, institutions, authors, journals, and the most cited articles, were analyzed using appropriate bibliometric tools. Mapping of keywords was done to identify the research trends. Results: Of 435 global publications on VDD in Covid-19, 187 (42.9%) were original articles. The total and average citations per paper (CPP) were 5664 and 13.0, respectively.

The main goal of this study is to develop a more effective method for diagnosing and predicting the COVID-19 spread and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures to reduce and stop the virus spread. To this end, the COVID-19 Decision-Making System (CDMS) was developed to study disease transmission. CDMS divides the population into groups as susceptible, infected, cured and dead. The trends of the people's number in these groups have deterministic and stochastic components. The deterministic components are described by a differential equations system with parameters determined by the data reported. The stochastic components are represented as an indicator of instability that characterizes the tendency of COVID-19 spread. The simulation experiments have shown a good agreement between the CDMS estimates and the data reported in Russia and Greece. The analysis performed showed that the newly-introduced instability indicator may be the precursor to the pandemic dynamics. In this context, our results showed three potential candidates for a second wave of COVID-19 disease: USA, Russia and Brazil. Although the proportion of infected individuals in countries with high temperatures is lower than in European countries and Russia, temperature and humidity are slowly affecting the effects of the pandemic.

METHODS: Systematic searches of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, ICTRP, and Clinical trials.gov were undertaken to identify studies including patients with cirrhosis undergoing appendicectomy, published since database inception to March 2021. Studies had to report mortality. Two review authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Pooled analysis of in-patient and 30-day mortality was performed. RESULTS: Of the 948 studies identified, four were included and this comprised three nationwide database studies (USA and Denmark) and one multi-centre observational study (Japan). A total of 923 patients had cirrhosis and 167,211 patients did not. In-patient mortality ranged from 0 to 1.7% in patients with cirrhosis and 0.17 to 0.3% in patients without. 30-day mortality was 9% in patients with cirrhosis compared to 0.3% in those without. One study stratified cirrhotic patients into compensated and decompensated groups. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, mortality following laparoscopic appendicectomy (0.5%) was significantly lower than open appendicectomy (3.2%). The meta-analysis highlighted a tenfold increase in perioperative mortality in cirrhotic patients (OR 9.92 (95% CI 4.67 to 21.06, I2 = 28%). All studies reported an increased length of stay in patients with cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that appendicectomy in the cirrhotic population is associated with increased mortality.

MAIN BODY: In light of the higher vulnerability of men to COVID-19 than women, there is rising concerns on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and possibilities of seminal contamination and transmission. The pandemic has attributed to the brief suspension of many fertility clinics and pathology laboratories, though many remained functional. Few reports reflect that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate the semen of COVID-19 patients as well as that of recovering patients. The viral invasion into the testis may be due to the disrupted anatomical barriers of the testis by the inflammatory responses, and the persistence of the virus in the semen may be facilitated by the testicular immune privilege. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, it is also theoretically possible that this virus can remain viable in the semen samples even after cryopreservation with liquid nitrogen. CONCLUSION: The present review emphasizes the possibilities of seminal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby the chances of its sexual transmission. These perceptions and predictions are to facilitate immediate necessary actions to improvise the standard precautionary procedures for laboratory practices, including semen analysis or processing the semen sample for fertility treatments.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and human semen: possible modes of contamination and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between uptake of the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 targeting the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and Gleason score in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.

A cut-off for tumor SUVmax could be established with a sensitivity of 96% (79-99%) and specificity of 75% (30-95%) in detecting Gleason Scores &#8805;3+4. For discriminating Gleason score &#8805; 4+3 vs. &#8804; 3+4, a cut-off could be established for detecting Gleason score &#8805; 4+3 with a sensitivity of 93% (69-99%) and specificity of 62% (36-82%). Conclusion: SUV measurements from uPAR PET in primary tumors as delineated by mpMRI showed a significant correlation with Gleason score, and tumor SUVmax was able to discriminate between low-risk and intermediate risk Gleason score profiles with high diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, uPAR PET/MRI could be a promising method for non-invasive evaluation of PCa, which may in the future potentially reduce the need for repeated biopsies, e.g. in active surveillance.","output":"Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) PET/MRI of Prostate Cancer for Non-invasive Evaluation of Aggressiveness: a Prospective Phase II Clinical Trial Comparing with Gleason Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that struck New York City in the spring of 2020 was a natural experiment for the clinical ethics services of NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) Two distinct teams at NYP's flagship academic medical centers-at NYP/Columbia University Medical Center (Columbia) and NYP/Weill Cornell Medical Center (Weill Cornell)-were faced with the same pandemic and operated under the same institutional rules Each campus used time as an heuristic to analyze our collective response The Columbia team compares consults during the pandemic with the same period during the year prior The Weill Cornell service describes the phases of the pandemic to depict its temporal evolution and subsequent ethical challenges Both sites report that the predominant ethical challenges centered around end-of-life decision making, setting goals of care, and medical futility, all complicated by resource allocation questions and the ambiguity of state law under crisis standards of care The Columbia campus saw a statistically significant increase in ethics consultations provided to Hispanic patients, perhaps reflective of the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 suffered by this demographic While Weill Cornell and Columbia saw a surge in clinical ethics consultations, the two services assumed a more expansive role than one normally played in institutional life Serving as intermediaries between frontline clinicians and senior hospital administrators, consultants provided critical intelligence to hospital leadership about the evolution of the pandemic, disseminated information to clinicians, and attended to the moral distress of colleagues who were asked to provide care under truly extraordinary circumstances The COVID-19 surge in New York City revealed latent capabilities in ethics consultation that may prove useful to the broader clinical ethics community as it responds to the current pandemic and reconceptualizes its potential for future service","output":"The COVID-19 Crisis and Clinical Ethics in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with prolonged symptoms and post-recovery health impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the persistence of symptoms, lung function, and pulmonary diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in patients between 15 and 30 days after hospital discharge after admission for severe COVID-19. METHODS: The evaluation consisted of 1) comparative analysis between the initial symptoms and symptoms still present at the post-discharge evaluation 2) analysis of the chest images obtained during hospitalization, and 3) conducting spirometry, plethysmography, and DLCO assessment. RESULTS: Forty-one patients who were hospitalized for 168 days with severe COVID-19 were included. Patients were predominantly men (73%) and had a mean age of 5114 years. The most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (51%) and diabetes mellitus (37%). Pulmonary evaluation was performed a mean of 36 days after the onset of symptoms, with the most frequent persistent symptoms being dyspnea (83%) and coughing (54%). Approximately 93% of patients still had at least one symptom, and 20% had more than five symptoms. Chest imaging revealed a typical pattern of COVID-19 on X-ray (93%) and computer tomography (95%). Lung function test results showed a restrictive pattern with a reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) in 54% of individuals, with an average FVC of 7814%.

During our initial contact with these clients, they reported being less active than they were pre-lockdown. Reduced physical activity is directly related to quality of life (QoL). So, it became important for our team to look into innovative ways to engage with our clients. The aim was to find an effective alternative way for clients to participate in our Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) while the restrictions were in place. Methods: This service evaluation used a mixed method approach to investigate the effectiveness of Virtual PR (VPR). Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected during the initial assessment (IA) and post assessment (PA) for comparison. Informal feedbacks were collected from clients and staff during the VPR group sessions. Quantitative data: 1. COPD Assessment Tool (CAT), measures the impact of condition on client's health. 2. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. 3. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety. 4. Exercise Tolerance test (ET) Qualitative data: 1. Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (MRC) 2. Client satisfactory survey during PA. Results: Of the 52 digitally enabled clients that were offered VPR, 88% completed the programme. 4% dropped out and the remaining 8% were expelled due to medical reasons. 11% of those who completed were housebound either due to their condition or lack of transport. 93% of the clients attended ten or more of the allocated 12 sessions. At the end of VPR, 13% of clients reported an improvement in MRC, and 65% of the clients had attained minimally important difference in ET. During IA, 86% reported to have medium to high impact on CAT. 43% of those clients had dropped to a lower impact level during post assessment. Initially, 63% reported to have psychological symptoms in at least one or both of the questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7). Of these 29 clients who reported symptoms, 62% showed improvement at the end. 95% have said that VPR has motivated them to be active, 41% would have preferred face to face (F2F) sessions for the social aspects of the group, but all participants agreed that VPR was a good alternative. 95% of clients rated 8 or above for the quality of the sessions. During informal interviews, clients said VPR has saved them travel time and reduced dependency on family for transport. Staff reported lack of exercise equipment had an impact on the progress when compared to F2F. Conclusion(s): VPR as a digital solution has a positive effect on both physiological and psychological symptoms, thus improving QoL. Also, proved to be cost, time and clinically effective way to rehabilitate housebound clients. VPR is a good alternative to F2F sessions, but further work needs to be done to enable clients in digital and data poverty to uptake VPR to ensure fair access. Impact: VPR has been imbedded into our pathway and will be offered based on clinical decision and clients choice. Referral form will be revised to reflect the optional digital pathway.

To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen ~6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with quantitative cell biology approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for biophysical aspects of the membrane, particularly cholesterol-rich regions, in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

Nevertheless, vaccination coverage among the at-risk population is low. Our understanding of the behaviour of the influenza virus during the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic is limited, meaning influenza vaccination is still recommended for individuals at risk for severe complications due to influenza infection. The aim of the study is to determine the intention to vaccinate against seasonal influenza among the at-risk population in the 2020-21 campaign during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to analyse the factors which influence such intention. METHODS: Cross-sectional telephone survey of adults (aged over 18) with risk factors in central Catalonia where the need for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (SIV) was recommended. RESULTS: A total of 434 participants responded to the survey, 43.3% of whom intended to be vaccinated against influenza for the 2020-2021 influenza season, 40.8% had no intention to be vaccinated and 15.9% were uncertain or did not express their opinion. The intention to get vaccinated against influenza is associated with having dependents, the individuals perception of the risk of being infected with influenza and the perceived risk of transmission to dependents. It is also associated with age, whether the individual had received influenza vaccine the previous season or any other season before. The best predictors of the intention to vaccinate are the individuals perception of the risk of catching influenza and whether the individual had been vaccinated in the previous season. CONCLUSIONS: Intention to vaccinate can be a good predictor of individual behaviour in relation to vaccination. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic many individuals are hesitant to influenza vaccination. In order to improve influenza vaccination coverage in people included in risk groups, it is necessary to promote educational actions, especially among those who express doubts.

The minimized structure was used to generate best scoring SARS-Cov2-E-CDC/UDC complexes through blind docking. These complexes were subjected to 230 ns molecular dynamics simulations in triplicates in a DPPC membrane environment. Comparative analyses of structural properties and molecular interaction profiles from the MD trajectories revealed that, both CDC and UDC could stably bind to SARS-Cov2-E through H-bonds, water-bridges and hydrophobic contacts with the transmembrane-channelresidues.T30 was observed to be a key residue for CDC/UDC binding. CDC/UDC binding affected the H-bonding pattern between adjacent monomeric chains, slackening the compact transmembrane region of SARS-Cov2-E. Additionally, the polar functional groups of CDC/UDC facilitated entry of a large number of water molecules into the channel. These observations suggest CDC/UDC as potential candidates to hinder the survival of SARS-Cov2 by disrupting the structure of SARS-Cov2-E and facilitating the entry of solvents/polar inhibitors inside the viral cell.

Uremic toxin-removing effectiveness between HD + MCO and mixed-dilution olHDF, one of the currently most efficient olHDF modalities, has not been assessed. METHOD This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 14 prevalent thrice-a-week HD patients with blood flow rate above 400 mL/min. The patients were randomized into two sequences of 2-week treatment periods of HD + MCO and later mixed-dilution olHDF or vice versa. The reduction ratio (RR) values of small-molecule as well as middle-molecule uremic toxins and protein-bound uremic toxins were measured at baseline and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS When compared with mixed-dilution olHDF, HD + MCO provided slightly lower 2M RR, but the value was still higher than 75%; showed similar FLC RR, IS RR, and URR; and yielded significantly higher RR values of 1M (p < 0.001) and FLC (p < 0.001).

We also hypothesized that these relationships are mediated by the objectivity of the media individuals inform themselves from, and the frequency of informing. The sample consisted of 341 participants from Serbia (mean age 33.51 years), 40.5% women. We measured authoritarianism, social conservatism, religiousness, conspiracy mentality, media objectivity, frequency of informing, and two sets of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs: Harmless virus and Hiding information. The results revealed that conservatism predicts all three outcome variables, authoritarianism only COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and religiousness only beliefs that the virus is harmless. Media objectivity does not mediate these relationships. Frequency of informing is a significant mediator only in a relationship between authoritarianism and all outcome variables, indicating that the role of seeking more information is in the function of reducing threat perceived by more authoritarian individuals. Additionally, the study reveals that media objectivity may not be important for reducing conspiracy beliefs, but rather media credibility.

The postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases, if it is made in the best interest of the patient. The preanesthetic evaluation should keep attention to the respiratory history of the patient. Cardiac anesthesia is always implying some respiratory monitoring; hence the existing clinical situation of the patients respiratory system should be clear. In case of emergency surgery, the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus.

As vaccines have been developed under expedited conditions, their safety and efficacy are being questioned by some populations leading to vaccine hesitancy, resulting in delayed vaccine uptake and herd immunity. This study aims to adopt a combination of Health Belief Model and other independent risk factors to help predict high vaccine acceptance. METHODS: An anonymized cross-sectional survey was distributed between 15 January and 3 February 2021 across Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia among adult respondents through a certified online panel. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were carried out to assess perception constructs followed by multivariate regression modelling to determine predictors of high vaccine acceptance for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 3,133 anonymised participants from Singapore (n=1,009), Australia (n=1,118) and Hong Kong (n=1,006) completed the survey. While age and gender were not significantly associated, Asian ethnicity, current smokers and self-efficacy were significant predictors of increased vaccine acceptance. While specific practices like taking micronutrients more frequently, cleaning and disinfecting their house more often were positively associated with increased vaccine acceptance, seeking medical help for COVID-19 symptoms like loss of smell/taste and overall COVID-19 knowledge score were negatively associated. Increased likelihood of vaccine acceptance was seen among those that obtained COVID-19 information less frequently and used digital media or non-health-related sources like influencers as a source of information. Among the eight perception constructs, perceived susceptibility and perceived response efficacy were positively associated, while perceived barriers were negatively associated with high vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: While demographic parameters have weak association with vaccine acceptance, perceptions and practices can help to better understand predictors of vaccine acceptance. Study findings should provide guidance on the risk communication strategy to enhance vaccine acceptance for vaccination and boosters against COVID-19.","output":"Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intent in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community sport is seen as a suitable setting for physical activity for different population groups. Older adults (aged 50+ years) are a rapidly growing population group. Physical activity is critical for healthy ageing, however sport participation rates for older adults are very low. The aim of this study was to investigate how sporting organisations perceive sport for older adults. This cross-sectional study surveyed 171 representatives from Australian National and State Sporting Organisations. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the results and the three sporting organisation categories' (high, medium, and low participation) responses were compared using non-parametric statistics. Contextualised in the perspective of organisational change, a framework for marketing to the ageing consumer was used to interpret the results. Older adults are not a high priority group for most sporting organisations, however the benefits of engaging older adults were recognised, particularly in context of increasing participation numbers. A lack of age-appropriate programmes was perceived to be a major barrier of engaging older adults. This lack of programmes stems from older adults being deemed as a less attractive segment than other age groups for sporting organisations. Modifications that sports felt they could make to attract and/or retain older adults included specific marketing and age appropriate opportunities. There was widespread consensus across sporting organisations, suggesting that perceptions of older adult sport participation were comparable across the sector, such as increasing participation numbers and engaging their older fan base. In the context of attracting, and retaining, older adults in sport clubs, it was concluded that most sporting organisations are not (yet) ready to build age friendly sporting environments. There is very limited literature on the organisational perspective of older adults and sport, meaning this study is unique in the field. Although sport policy encourages organisations to grow their participation, most organisations do not actively and strategically engage older adults. This research provides an understanding of why this untapped market is not a priority target and provides comprehensive insights for policy makers to better engage with this population group.","output":"Marketing Up the Wrong Tree?

Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.","output":"Effect of risk perception on epidemic spreading in temporal networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this analysis, we review the history of the contact tracing app developed by England's National Health Service and the differences of opinion over so-called centralised and decentralised technical approaches.

To determine the intracellular origin of the web, we examined NS4B colocalization with endogenous cellular markers in the context of the full-length or subgenomic replicon. We found that, in addition to ER markers, early endosome (EE) proteins, including Rab5, were associated with web-inducing protein NS4B. Furthermore, an immunoisolated fraction containing NS4B was found to contain both ER and EE proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, we showed that wild-type and constitutively active Rab5 proteins were associated with NS4B. Interestingly, expression of dominant-negative Rab5 resulted in significant loss of GFP fluorescence in NS5A-GFP replicon cells. We also found that a small reduction in Rab5 protein expression decreased HCV RNA synthesis significantly. Furthermore, transfection of labeled Rab5 small interfering RNAs into NS5A-GFP replicon cells resulted in a significant decrease in GFP fluorescence. Finally, Rab5 protein was found to coimmunoprecipitate with HCV NS4B.

Curcumin (50 M, no incubation period, i.p.) supplemented with 10% or 0.5% DMSO as well as SA-CUR 12a (50 M no i.p or 5 min i.p.) triggered a photoantifungal effect of >4 log units towards C. albicans.

Photoinactivation with 50 M or 100 M curcumin (+0.5% DMSO) resulted in complete growth inhibition. PDI using 20, 50 or 100 M SA-CUR 12a (with or without 10% DMSO) also showed a significant reduction in colony area compared to the control after 48 h, although less pronounced compared to curcumin.

Results: An initial search generated 12 studies but after excluding case reports and multiple reports comprising of the same series of patients, a total of five reports consisting of 51 patients were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 59 years (IQR 36-75), and 40 (78 %) were men. Median NIHSS on presentation was 20 (IQR 10-29). AIS with LVO was the presenting manifestation of COVID-19 in 16 (20%) of patients. Intracranial ICA was the most common site of occlusion found in 27 (53%) of patients with multi-territory occlusion in 10 (20 %). Final recanalization TICI  2b was achieved in 33 (64%) of patients but reocclusion was noted in 7 (14 %). Modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-2 was reported in 12 (23 %) of patients with 40 % in-hospital mortality. When compared to historic data from HC, COVID -19 patients were younger (59 vs 69 years), presented with a higher median NIHSS score (20 vs 17), and had a higher prevalence of ICA terminus occlusion (53% vs21% ). Similarly, patient outcomes were poor in the COVID -19 group with mRs 0-2 in (23 % versus46 %) and mortality (40 % vs 15 %) compared to Hermes group. Conclusion: COVID -19 AIS patients with LVO who underwent MT were younger, had multipleterritory occlusions with a propensity for ICA terminus location, and had poor angiographic andclinical outcomes as compared to historic data.","output":"Mechanical thrombectomy in COVID-19 positive patients with large vessel occlusion: Pooled review of individual case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The context and purpose of the study included 1) bacterial expression of viral protein 6 (VP6) of porcine rotavirus (PRV) and generation of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the VP6 protein; 3) establishment of a discrimination ELISA to distinguish PRV from a panel of other porcine viruses. RESULTS: The VP6 gene of PRV isolate DN30209 amplified by reverse transcription-PCR was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding 397 amino acids.

Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.","output":"Magnitude and time-course of excess mortality during COVID-19 outbreak: population-based empirical evidence from highly impacted provinces in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0249249.].","output":"Correction: Sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Luanda, Angola"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many educational institutions have transitioned to online instruction As a result, instructors need to investigate online small group learning opportunities to bond with their students who feel isolated from their peers due to social-distancing guidelines In this paper, we discuss three key issues in online hands-on learning: 1) interactions, 2) equity and inclusive participation, and 3) students readiness for hands-on or higher-level cognitive learning We reflect on our teaching experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer suggestions to help instructors plan and implement online small group hands-on learning","output":"Pandemic Pedagogy in Online Hands-on Learning for IT/IS Courses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, sound-based COVID-19 detection studies have shown great promise to achieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features. Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions. Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19 detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data. As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails.

Developing countries, including Togo, have focused on reducing the risk of health care utilization during this period by ensuring basic health care services as an important policy to improve health outcomes and meet international obligations to make health services accessible. METHODS: The data used to cover all 44 districts in the six (6) health regions of Togo, are from a national home survey. They are collected from July 8th to 17th, 2020. In each district chief town, a minimum of thirty (30) households were included by a systematic two-stage random draw (neighborhood and then home). Based on these data, the multinomial regression model was used to identify risk factors for the request for health care services during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1946 (with a response rate of 98.3%) participants were addressed in the study. The finding on households with age above 60 years indicated that the relative risk ratio (RRR = 23.97; 95% CI = 0.93; 615.38) allowed them to practice self-medication in lieu of modern healthcare facilities. The multinomial model revealed that the relative risk ratio of pre-COVID-19 activities (RRR = 4.87; 95% CI = 1.018; 23.38) permits households to rely on their self-medication choice and (RRR = 3.14; 95% CI = 0.91; 0.83) prefer public health facilities. Given that the head of the households (RRR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.017, 2.11) is educated, he prefers the choice of private health centers during COVID-19 pandemic to public health facilities. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the majority (30.49%) of patients sought health care. The analysis shows that the loss of employment, activities before COVID-19 in households and areas not infected by the pandemics allow them to ask for health care (self-medication and public hospitals) despite the COVID-19 impacts. However, higher education and age determine a different choice of health care delivery by households. Thus, policy makers need to cast special emphasis on social policies to address home health shocks.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on demand for healthcare in Togo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vascular leakage plays a vital role in sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction. Currently, no specific measures are available for vascular leakage. Ferroptosis, as a recently recognized form of cell death, plays a crucial role in cell dysfunction. It is still unknown whether ferroptosis participates in the occurrence of organ dysfunction following sepsis. Our previous study showed that dexmedetomidine (Dex) could alleviate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. However, whether the mechanism is related to ferroptosis is not clear. METHODS: The publicly available datasets of septic patients were reanalyzed, and septic models in vivo and vitro by cecal ligation and puncture and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were applied. The occurrence of ferroptosis in septic patients and rats was observed, and the protective effects of Dex on ferroptosis, and related mechanisms on regulating metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial fission were further studied. RESULTS: The transcriptomics data of patients from the GEO database showed that ferroptosis was closely related to sepsis. Sepsis induced significant ferroptosis in VECs by metabolomics analysis. The level of lipid peroxidation was increased in VECs, and the mitochondrial cristae was decreased after sepsis. Metabolomics analysis showed that Dex activated the pentose phosphate pathway and increased glutathione in VECs via up-regulation of G6PD expression. Dex could antagonize sepsis-induced the decrease in the level of Nrf2. The Nrf2 inhibitor reversed the protective effect of Dex on ferroptosis. Further study showed that Dex significantly alleviated sepsis-induced mitochondrial over-division, improved mitochondrial function, and decreased ROS, further inhibiting the ferroptosis of VECs. Dex alleviated the permeability of vessels by reducing ferroptosis and enhanced the intercellular junction of VECs. CONCLUSION: Dex protects vascular leakage following sepsis by inhibiting ferroptosis. The mechanism is mainly related to metabolic reprogramming via Nrf2 up-regulation and inhibition of mitochondrial fission.","output":"Protective Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Sepsis-Induced Vascular Leakage by Alleviating Ferroptosis via Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnostics are challenging in primary care and reliable diagnostic aids are desired. Qualitative faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) have been used for suspected CRC in Sweden since the mid-2000s, but evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce. Anaemia and thrombocytosis are both associated with CRC. AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of qualitative FITs requested for symptomatic patients in primary care, alone and combined with findings of anaemia and thrombocytosis, in the diagnosis of CRC. DESIGN AND SETTING: A population-based cohort study using electronic health records and data from the Swedish Cancer Register, covering five Swedish regions. METHOD: Patients aged &#8805;18 years in the five regions who had provided FITs requested by primary care practitioners from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 were identified. FIT and blood-count data were registered and all CRC diagnoses made within 2 years were retrieved. Diagnostic measurements were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 15 789 patients provided FITs (four different brands); of these patients, 304 were later diagnosed with CRC. Haemoglobin levels were available for 13 863 patients, and platelet counts for 10 973 patients. Calculated for the different FIT brands only, the sensitivities for CRC were 81.6%-100%; specificities 65.7%-79.5%; positive predictive values 4.7%-8.1%; and negative predictive values 99.5%-100%. Calculated for the finding of either a positive FIT or anaemia, the sensitivities increased to 88.9-100%. Adding thrombocytosis did not further increase the diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: Qualitative FITs requested in primary care seem to be useful as rule-in tests for referral when CRC is suspected. A negative FIT and no anaemia indicate a low risk of CRC.","output":"Diagnosing colorectal cancer in primary care: cohort study in Sweden of qualitative faecal immunochemical tests, haemoglobin levels, and platelet counts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has led to lockdowns across the world with people being separated from their loved ones including partners, family, and friends. Here, using a large sample of 1,749 Australians and Americans, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 isolation on younger populations (13-25 years), and the influence of coping strategies and mental well-being on this impact. Overall, COVID-19 isolation had a more negative impact on adolescence (13-17 years) than young adulthood (18-25 years), but with no difference apparent between men and women, or between Australian and American residents. However, a deeper analysis revealed a gender-specific effect: the type of coping strategies differentially influenced the negative impact of COVID-19 isolation on men with various levels of well-being, an interaction effect not apparent in women. For men with lower levels of mental well-being, COVID-19 isolation appeared to have a less negative impact on them if they used more approach-oriented coping strategies (e.g., actively focusing on the problem). Our results provide cross-sectional evidence for a differential impact on young men at low levels of wellbeing by pandemic isolation. In sum, young men and adolescent boys with lower well-being coped better with COVID-19 isolation when they used more approach coping strategies.","output":"Approach Coping Mitigates Distress of COVID-19 Isolation for Young Men With Low Well-Being in a Sample of 1,749 Youth From Australia and the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To introduce a composite tool called Design Diagnostic that allows a rapid but triangulated insight into key areas of a facility combining the methods of shadowing, behavior mapping, surveys, interviews, photo-essays, and parametric analysis to determine key challenges and opportunities for improvement, identify future design drivers, and recommend simple \\"do-now\\" changes.

The authors, from Japan and around the world, represent all aspects of the development of medical devices, including scientists and engineers, clinicians, academics, business people, and clinical practitioners. RESULTS: While the idea of pulse oximetry originated in Japan, device development lagged in Japan due to a lack of business, clinical, and academic interest. Awareness of the importance of anesthesia safety in the US, due to academic foresight and media attention, in combination with excellence in technological innovation, led to widespread use of pulse oximetry around the world.

Cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis supports the extensive interactions between THO and Gbp2, further revealing that RRM domains of Gbp2 are in close proximity to the C-terminal domain of Tho2.

A significant number of patients develop a severe form of COVID-19 characterized by coagulopathy, organ failure, and elevated mortality. In addition, an unusually high frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) has been found in patients with COVID-19. These clinical and serological manifestations closely resemble those seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially in its catastrophic form, suggesting a role of aPLs in immune-associated coagulopathy. However, government bodies such as the American Society of Hematology have spoken out against the systematic search for aPLs in patients with COVID-19. In an attempt to bridge the gap on this hot topic, we conducted a comprehensive review of currently available cohort studies and case series systematically evaluating aPLs in COVID-19 patients. In this Perspective, we seek to identify both the frequency and the type of aPLs found in patients with COVID-19, as well as the potential association of these aPLs with vascular thrombosis and other distinctive characteristics of COVID-19. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is evidence that allows us to define the occurrence of aPLs in COVID-19 as an epiphenomenon, as has been observed in other systemic viral infections, or as antibodies against self-antigens bearing hallmarks that suggest a pathogenic role in immune-mediated thrombosis. Defining whether aPLs represent an epiphenomenon or they are actually involved in hemostatic abnormalities of COVID-19 is crucial both for uncovering novel mechanisms of immune-mediated thrombosis and for identifying potential prognostic biomarkers in this devastating disease.","output":"Are antiphospholipid antibodies just a common epiphenomenon or are they causative of immune-mediated coagulopathy in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess parameters of ischiofemoral impingement on supine and standing anteroposterior hip radiographs and to suggest optimal cutoff points for detection of ischiofemoral impingement.

All hip joints with evidence of quadratus femoris muscle edema on MR images were included in the ischiofemoral impingement patient group. An age- and sex-matched control group was derived from the same cohort by propensity score matching. On radiographs, two readers independently measured the following parameters: ischiofemoral space, quadratus femoris space, hamstring tendon area, ischiofemoral distance on supine radiograph, ischiofemoral distance on standing radiograph, and femoral neck-shaft angle. Group differences in parameters were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test. The intraclass correlation coefficient and the ROC AUC were obtained. Correlations between radiographic and MRI measures were assessed with Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman plot analyses. The Youden J index was used to select optimum cutoff points for each parameter. RESULTS There were 30 patients (44 hip joints; mean age, 54.8  11 years) in the ischiofemoral impingement group and 88 patients (88 hip joints; mean age, 51.8  13.4 years) in the control group. There were significant group differences in ischiofemoral space, quadratus femoris space, ischiofemoral distance on supine radiograph, ischiofemoral distance on standing radiograph, and neck-shaft angle (p < 0.05). Ischiofemoral distance on supine and standing radiographs exhibited good discriminative ability (AUC > 0.80).

The profession of a nurse, as well as a paramedic, is essential for the efficient functioning of healthcare. It has its importance not only in promoting and preserving health but also in prevention. With the increasing importance of providing medical care at the highest level, it is expected of these two professional groups to have more knowledge and skills than a few years earlier. The daily contact with patients and their families, the low level of control of the environment, the hierarchical system of professional dependence, and the dissatisfaction with remuneration are becoming extremely burdensome aspects of the nursing and paramedic professions. Long-term exposure to stressors associated with these medical professions may, in the long term, lead to the emergence of occupational burnout syndrome. The aim of this study is an attempt to answer the question of whether and how stress factors affect the occurrence of occupational burnout in the work of nurses and paramedics working in various medical entities. Material and Methods: The study covered a group of 434 respondents, including 220 nurses and 214 paramedics, working professionally in hospital departments and care and treatment facilities as well as in hospital emergency departments and ambulance services. The study was carried out using a diagnostic survey based on the questionnaire technique using the authors questionnaire and the standardized MBI Ch. Maslach. Two statistical values were used to statistically analyze the research results and verify the adopted hypotheses: the chi-square test and the Students t-test. Results and Conclusions: The current study showed that the phenomenon of occupational burnout among the studied group affects only nurses, while this problem does not apply to the studied paramedics. The main stressor among the nurses and paramedics is, above all, a very high level of responsibility. Nurses are overburdened by excessive demands and shift work, while paramedics are mostly burdened by an excess of duties.

Uric acid (UA) potentially causes kidney damage by alteration of renal autoregulation, inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, activation of the proinflammatory cascade, and crystal deposition. Hyperuricemia in patients with COVID-19 may contribute to acute kidney injury and poor outcomes. Methods: We included 834 patients with COVID-19 who were >18 years old and hospitalized for >24 hours in the Mount Sinai Health System and had at least one measurement of serum UA. We examined the association between the first serum UA level and major adverse kidney events (MAKE, defined by a composite of all-cause in-hospital mortality or RRT or 100% increase in serum creatinine from baseline), as well as markers of inflammation and cardiac injury. Results: Among the 834 patients, the median age was 66 years, 42% were women, and the median first UA was 5.9 mg/dL (IQR 4.5-8.8). Overall, 52% experienced MAKE, and 32% died during hospitalization.

AIMS: We aimed to survey the mental health of non-infectious disease specialist staff, specifically obstetricians and midwives, working in officially designated hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A nationwide online survey was conducted from 7 March to 17 March 2020 investigating the mental health of obstetricians and midwives (who were not themselves infected with COVID-19) working in hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. We used the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess their symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: A total of 885 (41.6%), 609 (28.6%) and 729 (34.3%) obstetricians and midwives reported depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5) and insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8), respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of whether or not they had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, obstetricians and midwives were more likely to report mild and moderate depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with before the pandemic. Those who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report depression and insomnia than those who did not. Those who had sufficient protective equipment or training were less likely to report depression, anxiety and insomnia than those who did not.

Although demand for bariatric surgery has grown, so too has the attrition rate. In this study we identify patient characteristics and operational interventions that have contributed to high attrition in a multistage, multidisciplinary bariatric surgery program. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study was conducted of 1,682 patients referred for bariatric surgery at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, from June 2008 to July 2011. Demographic information, presurgical assessment dates, and records describing operational changes were collected. Several penalized likelihood and mixed effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine whether patient characteristics, operational changes, and previous experience affected program completion and intermediate transitions between assessments. RESULTS Although the majority of attrition appears to be the result of patient self-removal, males (odds ratio [OR] 0.511, 95% CI 0.392 to 0.663, p < 0.001), and individuals with active substance use (OR 0.223, 95% CI 0.096 to 0.471, p < 0.001) were less likely to undergo surgery. Operational practices had a detrimental effect on program completion (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.456 to 0.762, p < 0.001). Conversely, patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m(2) (OR 1.756, 95% CI 1.233 to 2.515, p = 0.002) and those who lived within 25 to 300 km of the center (OR > 1.633, p < 0.001) were more likely to undergo surgery. CONCLUSIONS Certain subgroups in the referral population were found to be at a higher risk of noncompletion. Specialized care pathways must be implemented to address this issue. Furthermore, careful consideration must be given to operational decisions because they may negatively affect access to care, as we have shown.","output":"Analysis of patient attrition in a publicly funded bariatric surgery program."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally mild or asymptomatic in children but a biological basis for this outcome is unclear.

A literature review was conducted in the PubMed database with the following terms: \\"headache\\" and \\"COVID-19.\\" All articles written in English that were considered relevant were included. RESULTS Half of the patients who have COVID-19 present with headache, which occurs more frequently in younger patients; in those with previous primary headache or with previous migraine; and in those who have concomitantly presented with anosmia, ageusia, and myalgia. The headache usually begins early in the symptomatic phase, is bilateral, moderate to severe, and has a similar pattern to tension-type headache. All studies found the migraine pattern and the tension-type headache pattern to be frequent patterns. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms include direct viral injury, the inflammatory process, hypoxemia, coagulopathy, and endothelial involvement. Common analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most commonly used drugs for headache in the acute phase of COVID-19. The headache may persist beyond the acute phase, and in such cases, there is an improvement over time. However, not all patients' headaches improve.

The underlying molecular mechanisms behind these clinical observations have not yet been explained. Herein, we investigated the disease-specific gene expression signatures that may induce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We studied 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases of recent times that have shown comorbidity in one or another respiratory disease(s) caused by pathogenic human infecting coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. We retrieved array-based gene expression data for each disease and control from relevant datasets. Subsequently, all the datasets were quantile normalized, and log-2 transformed data was used for analysis. Results The expression of ACE2 receptor and host proteases, namely FURIN and TMPRSS2 that are essential for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, was upregulated in all six studied subtypes of leukemia (hereafter, referred as leukemia). The expression of ACE2 was also increased in psoriasis, lung cancer, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. The expression of FURIN was higher in psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and in type II diabetic liver, whereas it was lowered in breast cancer. Similarly, the expression of TMPRSS2 was increased during lung cancer and type II diabetes;it was decreased during psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.Furthermore, a heightened expression of genes that are involved in immune response was observed in leukemia patients, as shown by the higher expression of IFNA2, IFNA8, IFNA10, IFNA14, IFNA16, IFNA21, IFNB1, CXCL10, and IL6. The expression of JAK1, STAT1, IL6, and CXCL10 was higher in NAFLD. Besides, JAK1 and STAT1 were upregulated in type II diabetic muscles. In addition, most of the upregulated genes in COVID-19 patients showed a similar trend in leukemia, NAFLD, and psoriasis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, were found to commonly alter two genes, namely, CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 11 and CLUSTERIN. Conclusions: The genes that may confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly upregulated in leukemia patients;hence, leukemia patients are relatively more susceptible to develop COVID-19, followed by other chronic disorders, such as, NAFLD, type II diabetes, psoriasis, and hypertension.

Commencement of antibiotics was less frequent in the RPCR than MPCR cohorts (51% vs 67%; p < 0.01, OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34C0.79). People at high risk of complications from influenza who were tested with the RPCR were more likely to be treated with oseltamivir compared to those tested with the MPCR (76% vs 63%; p = 0.03, OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.07C3.08). Hospital length of stay was not impacted when either test was used in the emergency department and inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest utilisation of RPCR testing in influenza management can improve antibiotic stewardship through reduction in antibiotic use and improvement in oseltamivir initiation in those at higher risk of complications. Further research is required to determine other factors that may have influenced hospital length of stay and a cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the financial impact of the RPCR test.","output":"Differences in antibiotic and antiviral use in people with confirmed influenza: a retrospective comparison of rapid influenza PCR and multiplex respiratory virus PCR tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early days of a pandemic, repurposing biospecimens from established research projects could prove to be extraordinarily useful in achieving substantial and timely public health benefits. Nonetheless, there are potential ethical and regulatory uncertainties that may impede access to those valuable biospecimens. In this article, we argue that there should be a presumption in favor of using previously collected identifiable research biospecimens without reconsent to directly address an infectious disease pandemic, assuming certain conditions are met. This argument fills a unique yet critical gap in decision-making where the specific consent accompanying the identifiable biospecimens would not otherwise permit repurposing. Further, it suggests that even if gaining reconsent is feasible, doing so in a fast-moving crisis is not necessary. This analysis also attempts to address the ethical concerns of public health authorities who already may have the power to use such specimens but are reluctant to do so.","output":"The Ethics of Repurposing Previously Collected Research Biospecimens in an Infectious Disease Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, state and local governments implemented lockdown restrictions that were tremendously polarizing.

Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide.","output":"COVID-19 in Amazonas, Brazil, was driven by the persistence of endemic lineages and P.1 emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Homelessness is increasingly recognized as a crisis beyond Canadas largest cities where it is most visible, yet little is known about the experience and outcomes associated with rural homelessness. The aims of this study were to explore the experience of housing insecurity and its impact on the health of rural residents, identify the various factors contributing to homelessness in a rural Ontario context, and give voice to people with lived experience about their needs, challenges, and potential solutions to the housing crisis. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study used interpretive description and a critical theory lens. Interviews were conducted with people who were currently experiencing homelessness and key informants in a rural community experiencing a housing crisis. Data collection took place between August 2020 and May 2021. Analysis was inductive and concurrent. RESULTS: Findings from interviews with 27 participants (16 with lived experience and 11 key informants) revealed how the structural and social context contributed to rural homelessness. Barriers to securing rental housing in a tight market were influenced by small-town dynamics and discrimination. These experiences led to feelings of hopelessness, which combined with daily stressors of managing unsuitable living conditions to contribute to deteriorating physical and mental health. Opportunities for tailoring interventions to the rural context include increasing awareness, expanding transportation, improving access to local services, and applying Housing First principles.

Currently, considerable investments have been allocated for its renewal and maintenance that often surpass the budgets of owners, local communities, and other interested users. Cultural heritage valorisation is expensive and is a great economic challenge. Infrastructural investment, i.e., conservation and restoration, are just one part of the total costs of cultural heritage preservation, while other investments relate to regular operation and maintenance. One of the most difficult decisions for those who design the cultural heritage restoration projects is how to finance them, i.e., what the most efficient financial instruments are for renewal of cultural heritage. These assumptions have instigated interest in the evaluation of services resulting from common good functions of cultural heritage, such as economic, educational, historical, technological, ecological, and climate, as well as tourism and recreational.

Reducing inpatient violence is a major quality improvement (QI) priority for CNWL NHS Foundation Trust.MethodAs a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, Nile Ward looks after male patients suffering from severe mental illness (SMI). This usually includes patients presenting with high levels of violent and aggressive behaviour. Prior to this QI project, there were high levels of patient assaults towards staff and other patients. This required a lot of medication use, including rapid tranquilisation, restraint and the use of seclusion. This QI project was started to allow the Nile MDT to explore ways to reduce serious incidents on the ward in the least restrictive manner.We implemented a number of change ideas within this project. Our change ideas included: 1. A new risk management tool : Ragging', a daily risk assessment tool, was created to assess patients risk of violence and aggression to allow signposting of appropriate interventions to safely manage risk. 2. A brand new Staff Photo board : New photos of all permanent and bank staff displayed in the ward with no hierarchy of positions. 3. A new Patient Feedback board : Patient experience, comments and feedback displayed in common areas of the ward which are regularly updated. 4. Mutual Expectations between Staff and Patients: A set of expectations created in co-production with patients displayed in the communal areas of the ward to be followed by both staff and patients. 5. Gardening sessions : One of our newer change ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic was to provide a safe, socially distanced space for patients to be involved in growing and caring for the Nile Ward garden with our activities co-ordinator. 6. Optimisation of Physical Exercise : Focus on physical activity through garden fitness sessions and 1-1 fitness sessions in the gym. This was another change idea commenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions occur throughout the day with our fitness instructor and enable our patients to focus on their physical health & fitness. 7. Improved Ward Environment : Gym equipment were upgraded and the appearance of the ward gymnasium was enhanced using quality art created in co-production with patients.ResultThere was a 43% reduction in the number of violent incidents in the ward following QI interventions. The details of the results will be depicted in pictorial form in the poster.ConclusionOur patients are able to recover in a safe environment with a reduced level of violence and aggression resulting in patients receiving less rapid tranquilisation and restrictive interventions. We have had fewer assaults on staff which has made our staff feel safer to work in a busy PICU. Staff feel more confident in their role through the use of the new risk assessment tool . Patients and staff alike have given positive feedback to the changes implemented in this QI project, with violence being successfully reduced by 43%.

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to switch to teleworking. The abrupt change from an office setting to an improvised home-office may negatively affect the musculoskeletal and emotional health of workers. By providing mental and physical exercises, yoga may be effective in reducing adverse effects. METHOD Fifty-four participants (42 women, 12 men) followed a 1-month yoga program, while 40 participants (26 women, 14 men) continued with their common work routine. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to evaluate severity, interference with work and frequency of pain, and to obtain a total discomfort score for 25 body areas. Mood disturbance was evaluated with the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. Both groups completed both questionnaires, before and after the experimentation period. RESULTS After 1 month, for the yoga group only, significant reductions were observed in the discomfort of eyes, head, neck, upper and lower back, right wrist, and hips/buttocks, as well as reductions in discomfort severity, frequency and interference for the neck, upper and lower back. Total mood disturbance was also significantly reduced for the yoga group only. No favorable changes occurred for the control group.

The attention from both public and policy keeps raising on related practical problems, including 1) how to protect data security and location privacy? 2) how to efficiently and dynamically deploy SRC Internet of Thing (IoT) witnesses to monitor large areas? To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named Bychain. Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum monitoring coverage deployment. We implemented and evaluated the proposed blockchain protocol in the real-world using the Bluetooth 5.0.

Tianma Gouteng (TMGT), a traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescription, has been used for the clinical treatment of CI. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint analysis was used to detect and identify major chemical constituents of TMGT. TCMSP and BATMAN-TCM databases were used to screen for active TMGT constituent compounds, while the GeneCards database was used to screen for protein targets associated with CI. Next, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of these core nodes were performed to determine the identities of key associated biological processes and signal pathways. Meanwhile, a total of six possible gene targets of TMGT, including NFKBIA, PPARG, IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, and HIF1A, were selected for further study using two cellular models of CI. For one model, PC12 cells were treated under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions to generate an OGD cellular model of CI, while for the other model, BV2 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to generate a cellular model of CI-associated inflammation. Ultimately TMGT treatment increased PPAR expression and downregulated the expression of p-P65, p-IB, and HIF-1 in both OGD-induced and LPS-induced cell models of CI. In addition, molecular docking analysis showed that one TMGT chemical constituent, quercetin, may be a bioactive TMGT compound with activity that may be associated with the alleviation of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation triggered by CI. Moreover, additional data obtained in this work revealed that TMGT could inhibit neuroinflammation and protect brain cells from OGD-induced and LPS-induced damage by altering HIF-1/PPAR/NF-B pathway functions. Thus, targeting this pathway through TMGT administration to CI patients may be a strategy for alleviating nerve injury and neuroinflammation triggered by CI.","output":"Underlying Mechanism and Active Ingredients of Tianma Gouteng Acting on Cerebral Infarction as Determined via Network Pharmacology Analysis Combined With Experimental Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study presented in the paper aims to analyze the Russian print media market before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the prospects of local media transformation in the challenging environment.

MethodsWe used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a harmonized EHR repository with 2,965,506 COVID-19 positive patients, and compared cohorts of COVID-19 patients with comparable controls. Patients were propensity score-matched to control for confounding factors. We estimated the hazard ratio (COVID-19:control) for new-onset of mental illness for the first year following diagnosis. We additionally estimated the change in risk for new-onset mental illness between the periods of 21-120 and 121-365 days following infection. FindingsWe find a significant increase in incidence of new-onset mental disorders in the period of 21-120 days following COVID-19 (3.8%, 3.6-4.0) compared to patients with respiratory tract infections (3%, 2.8-3.2).

The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included. Baseline clinical data and blood samples will be collected before randomisation and repeated daily for 7 days, at days 14 and 30. Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7 days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses.

The within-host model represents the innate immune response, and the between-hosts model signifies the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. The major contribution of this paper is to break the chain of infectious disease transmission by reducing the number of susceptible and infected people via transferring them to the recovered people group with vaccination and antiviral treatment, respectively. Both transfers are considered with time delay. In the first step, optimal control theory is applied to calculate the optimal final time to control the disease within a host's body with a cost function. To this end, the vaccination that represents the effort that converts healthy cells into resistant-to-infection cells in the susceptible individual's body is used as the first control input to vaccinate the susceptible individual against the disease. Moreover, the next control input (antiviral treatment) is applied to eradicate the concentrations of the virus and convert healthy cells into resistant-to-infection cells simultaneously in the infected person's body to treat the infected individual.

Using Pontryagin's maximum principle in the second step, an optimal control strategy is also applied to an SEIR mathematical model with a nonlinear transmission rate and time delay, which is computed as optimal time in the first step.

METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted with random volunteers recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an internet crowdsourcing service, on March 24, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 969 participants met the inclusion criteria. It was found that the perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly differed between age groups (P<.001) and men and women (P<.001). A majority of study participants were actively adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Though many participants identified COVID-19 as a threat, many failed to place themselves appropriately in the correct categories with respect to risk.

Potential adverse effects and selection of multi-drug resistant bacteria play minor roles in decision making. This narrative review first describes harm from antibiotics and second focuses on different aspects that could help to reduce antibiotic overtreatment without harming the patient: harm from antibiotic treatment, diagnostic approaches, role of biomarkers, timing of antibiotic therapy, empiric therapy, targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Wherever possible, we linked the described evidence to the current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Antibiotic stewardship programs should help guiding antibiotic therapy for critically ill children. IMPACT: Critically ill children can be harmed by inadequate or overuse of antibiotics. Hemodynamically unstable children with a suspicion of infection should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In contrast, in hemodynamically stable children with sepsis and organ dysfunction, a time frame of 3 h for proper diagnostics may be adequate before starting antibiotics if necessary.

While data generated by these platforms can help public health organisations find community hotspots and effectively direct control measures, it has never been compared to traditional systems. OBJECTIVE Methods and Objectives: A completely anonymised web based PDS system, www.trackcovid-19.org was developed. We evaluated the symptomatic responses received form the PDS system to the traditional risk based surveillance carried out by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike over a period of 45 days in the South Indian city of Bengaluru. METHODS Methods and Objectives: A completely anonymised web based PDS system, www.trackcovid-19.org was developed. We evaluated the symptomatic responses received form the PDS system to the traditional risk based surveillance carried out by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike over a period of 45 days in the South Indian city of Bengaluru. RESULTS Results: The PDS system recorded 11062 entries from 106 Postal codes. A healthy response was obtained from 10863 users while 199 (1.8%) reported symptomatic.

The virus was able to spread throughout the world, causing a global health crisis. The virus spread widely in Jordan after a wedding party held in northern Jordan. In most cases of COVID-19 infection, respiratory symptoms are predominant. However, in rare cases the disease may present with non-respiratory symptoms. The presentation of COVID-19 as a case of intussusception in children is a strange and rare phenomenon. We present here a case of a two-and-a-half month old male baby who was brought to hospital due to fever, frequent vomiting, dehydration and blood in stool. He was diagnosed as intussusception. The child was tested for corona due to the large societal spread of the virus and because he was near his mother, who was suffering from symptoms similar to corona or seasonal flu (she did not conduct a corona test). Patient was treated without surgery and recovered quickly. The COVID-19 infection was without respiratory symptoms, and there was no need for the child to remain in hospital after treatment of intussusception. The relationship between viruses, mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia, and intussusception is a confirmed relation. ACE2 is the key receptor required for SARA-COV-2 to enter the host cells. ACE2 has been also found in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa, as well as it is a key inflammatory regulator in the intestine. This may suggest that SARSA-COV-2 could invade the respiratory tract as well as gastrointestinal tract or both. Few case reports documented the presentation of COVID-19 as intussusception in children. In the light of the wide-spread of corona virus, performing COVID-19 tests for children with intussusception can help linking the two entities. Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 positive children should raise concern about the development of intussusception.","output":"COVID-19 presenting as intussusception in infants: A case report with literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide since late 2019.

Although the size, composition, complexity, and functions encoded by their genomes are remarkably diverse, all viruses rely absolutely on the protein synthesis machinery of their host cells. Lacking their own translational apparatus, they must recruit cellular ribosomes in order to translate viral mRNAs and produce the protein products required for their replication. In addition, there are other constraints on viral protein production. Crucially, host innate defenses and stress responses capable of inactivating the translation machinery must be effectively neutralized. Furthermore, the limited coding capacity of the viral genome needs to be used optimally.

The survey collected demographic data and questions regarding participants working position since pandemic outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: Spanish healthcare workers working on the FL or usual ward were eligible. A total of 674 healthcare professionals answered the survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Burn-out syndrome was assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Medical Personnel. RESULTS: Of the 643 eligible responding participants, 408 (63.5%) were physicians, 172 (26.8%) were nurses and 63 (9.8%) other technical occupations. 377 (58.6%) worked on the FL. Most participants were women (472 (73.4%)), aged 31C40 years (163 (25.3%)) and worked in tertiary hospitals (>600 beds) (260 (40.4%)). Prevalence of burn-out syndrome was 43.4% (95% CI 39.5% to 47.2%), higher in COVID-19 FL workers (49.6%, p<0.001) than in non- COVID-19 FL workers (34.6%, p<0.001). Women felt more burn-out (60.8%, p=0.016), were more afraid of self-infection (61.9%, p=0.021) and of their performance and quality of care provided to the patients (75.8%, p=0.015) than men. More burn-out were those between 20 and 30 years old (65.2%, p=0.026) and those with more than 15 years of experience (53.7%, p=0.035).

I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.","output":"Translational frameshifting in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the use of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) to improve the extraction efficiency of the classical solvent extraction techniques such as maceration extraction (ME) and soxhlet extraction (SE) to extract five isoflavones (tectoridin, iristectorin B, iristectorin A, tectorigenin and iristectorigenin A) from Iris tectorum.

Patients may be frail, acutely unwell, or have terminal illnesses such as dementia. It is therefore essential that clinicians review resuscitation status as part of their routine practice. However, we are aware that advanced decision-making C to resuscitate or not to resuscitate C is not routine practice across older adult psychiatric wards in the UK. Our 2017 audit reflected this, demonstrating a very low rate of resuscitation decisions at NELFT. This re-audit aimed to measure the frequency and quality of resuscitation decisions on an older adult psychiatric ward. We expected improvements in these areas, subsequent to changes implemented from the initial audit. We also sought to identify which patient factors influenced clinicians decision-making on resuscitation. Please note, this audit was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: In June 2017, an audit of 25 patients admitted to two older adult psychiatric acute wards was completed. In December 2019, a retrospective analysis of the last 25 admissions to one older adult ward was undertaken. Electronic patient notes and DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) orders were examined. The audit measured frequency of resuscitation decisions and quality of documentation against current standards. DNACPR orders were analysed and clinicians were interviewed to identify the reasons for such decisions. RESULT: There was an increase in the number of patients for which resuscitation decisions were made, from 4% in 2017 to 40% (n = 10) in 2019. The majority of patients with a DNACPR decision (n = 8) had a diagnosis of dementia. Prospective quality of life, with this diagnosis, was the most frequent determinant of DNACPR decisions (n = 7). Qualitative analysis indicated that clinicians were more likely to consider a resuscitation decision for patients with an organic disorder rather than functional disorder. Adequate completion of DNACPR orders was seen in each case. Either the patient, a family member or carer was involved in every decision. The standard for recording decisions on the electronic patient record was not met. CONCLUSION: It is good practice to consider resuscitation decisions for patients admitted to older adult psychiatric wards. This re-audit found an improvement in frequency of resuscitation decisions and also revealed differences in decision-making for patients with organic and functional disorders.

OBJECTIVE To explore ideal components of a culturally relevant mHealth weight management program for AAW and to examine how these components may vary by age group. DESIGN Twelve focus group triads were conducted with AAW in north central Florida. The framework method was used to manage, organize, synthesize, and analyze data themes by age groups: 18 to 29 (young), 30 to 50 (middle age), and 51+ (older). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING Thirty-six smartphone owners who expressed a desire to lose weight were recruited through several community partnerships. RESULTS Based on body mass index (BMI), young women were classified as overweight (BMI 26.23  6.7), middle-aged women as obese (BMI30.72  8.31), and older women as obese (BMI 31.03  5.67). Most searched online for dieting information within the past 12 months.

After the advent of ipilimumab, a survival benefit and better overall response rate could be offered to the patients. Other new therapies, such as immunotherapies, targeted therapies, vaccines, and small molecules, are currently being studied.

Methods Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted to 5 comprehensive stroke centers who were identified to have a symptomatic CaW and treated with carotid stenting. A symptomatic CaW was defined by the presence of a shelf-like/linear, smooth filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb diagnosed by neck CT angiography (CTA) and confirmed with conventional angiography in patients with negative stroke workup. Results Twenty-four patients with stented symptomatic CaW were identified (stroke in 83% and transient ischemic attack in 17%). Their median age was 47 years (IQR 41-61), 14 (58%) were female, and were 17 (71%) black. The degree of stenosis by NASCET was 0% (range 0-11). All patients were placed on dual antiplatelets and stented at a median of 9 days (IQR 4-35) after the last event. Closed-cell stents were used in 18 (75%) of the cases. No periprocedural events occurred with the exception of 2 cases of asymptomatic hypotension/bradycardia.

Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020. Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and &#8805;65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status. Results: Of 177a?919 serum samples tested, 103a?771 (58.3%) were from women, 26a?716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47a?513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26a?290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction. Biweekly nationwide testing of commercial clinical laboratory sera can play an important role in helping track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.","output":"Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in the US as of September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The collective experience of social distancing will undoubtedly have implications for our social, cultural, and political practices In this critical commentary, I consider the implications of these experiences by focusing on rural-urban relationships in Canada Drawing from accounts published in online newspapers, I reflect on how social distancing highlights the interdependencies of urban and rural Canada and the role of space and leisure in shaping our broader social and political discourse Reflecting on issues related to class, space, mobility, and freedom of choice, I suggest that rural-urban interdependencies is a productive framework for considering these relationships and how we might re-think them moving forward In conclusion, I offer hopeful speculations on how social distancing may indeed bring us closer together (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Rural-urban interdependencies: Thinking through the implications of space, leisure, politics and health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacy practice is the discipline concerning the roles of pharmacists in the healthcare setting Healthcare in Malaysia encompasses numerous sectors, such as academics, community, enforcement, hospital, industrial, jurisprudence, military, regulatory and research and development In addressing the crisis brought on by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacists and technicians have been highly involved in the delivery of healthcare services Malaysia has a distinct two-tier healthcare system and within this context, it is essential to integrate services during a crisis to maximise the available but limited medical resources Often, the focus is on realistic and logical public-private partnerships However, integrating different ministries offering healthcare facilities is also important and inter-agency pharmacy practice coordination must be optimised The Malaysian Armed Forces Health Services can be primed to enhance the nation's healthcare capacity and capability As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grip the nation and cause an unprecedented number of Malaysians to become very ill, pharmacists must be resilient in leading, adapting and integrating well-rounded strategies in their respective fields to ensure good pharmacy practice","output":"Challenges and Changes of Pharmacy Practice During the COVID-19 Crisis in Malaysia: Instability as an Opportunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the impact that psychological reactance has on the COVID-19 adherence-related behavior and vaccine motivations of the residents of Saudi Arabia.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with reninCangiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice. METHODS: Right atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection. Since ACEi or ARBs show no effect on ACE2 expression in the heart further support their safety.","output":"Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptorACE2 in human heart is associated with uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, and activation of the renin angiotensin system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndRome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which represents a global public health crisis.

Few parents practiced caries prevention procedures for their children in daily life, though. A novel intervention scheme using mobile messages will be developed in this study under the framework of the health belief model (HBM). The objective of the present randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effectiveness of the new scheme in promoting oral health of young children by reducing dental caries. METHODS: This RCT will involve 26C36 child care centers or kindergartens with nursery classes (clusters) located in Hong Kong. A total of 518C628 child-parent dyads (child age 18C30 months) will be recruited and randomly allocated at the cluster level into the test or control group with a 1:1 ratio. For parents in the test group, the intervention will consist of a set of HBM-based text messages sent regularly in 48 weeks. A standard text message will be sent to the parents in the control group in the first week. The primary outcome will be dental caries measured by dmft/dmfs of the children after 2 years (around 4 years of age). The secondary outcomes will be toothbtushing and sugar intake. DISCUSSION: HBM-based intervention via a low-cost text messaging vehicle may serve as a viable way to empower parents to establish proper oral health behaviors for their children and safeguard the oral health of children in Hong Kong.

Active student engagement is always a challenging task for educators regardless of the teaching modalities. The degree of challenge for active student engagement increases significantly in remote/online teaching and learning. This paper presents a framework that implements activities/strategies to ensure active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning during this COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of the developed framework combines the balanced use of adjusted teaching pedagogy, educational technologies, and an e-learning management system. Teaching pedagogy involves various active learning techniques, synchronous teaching, asynchronous teaching, and segmentation. The educational technologies, such as Google Meet, Jamboard, Google Chat, Breakout room, Mentimeter, Moodle, electronic writing devices, etc., enable the developed framework for active student engagement. An e-learning management system, Moodle, is used for course management purposes. Over the last three semesters (Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021), the framework is tested for three different engineering courses. A questionnaire draws out student perception on the developed framework in terms of active student engagement that ensures studentCstudent interactions, studentCinstructor interactions, social presence, reinforces learning and deepens understanding of the materials in remote teaching. The feedback also indicates that combining the utilized technologies, synchronous teaching, and active learning activities in the developed framework is effective for interactive learning;hence a practical approach for active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning.

However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability, and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance, and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification, respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19 classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings.

AIMS: We conducted a convenience electronic survey with a 21-item questionnaire aimed to identify the changes in stroke admission volumes and thrombectomy treatment practices seen during a specified time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey was designed using Qualtrics software and sent to stroke and neuro-interventional physicians around the world who are part of the Global Executive Committee (GEC) of Mission Thrombectomy 2020, a global coalition under the aegis of Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology, between April 5th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: There were 113 responses to the survey across 25 countries with a response rate of 31% among the GEC members. Globally there was a median 33% decrease in stroke admissions and a 25% decrease in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic period until May 15th, 2020 compared to pre-pandemic months. The intubation policy for MT procedures during the pandemic was highly variable across participating centers: 44% preferred intubating all patients, including 25% of centers that changed their policy to preferred-intubation (PI) from preferred non-intubation (PNI). On the other hand, 56% centers preferred not intubating patients undergoing MT, which included 27% centers that changed their policy from PI to PNI. There was no significant difference in rate of COVID-19 infection between PI versus PNI centers (p=0.60) or if intubation policy was changed in either direction (p=1.00). Low-volume (<10 stroke/month) compared with high-volume stroke centers (>20 strokes/month) were less likely to have neurointerventional suite specific written personal protective equipment protocols (74% vs 88%) and if present, these centers were more likely to report them to be inadequate (58% vs 92%). CONCLUSION: Our data provides a comprehensive snapshot of the impact on acute stroke care observed worldwide during the pandemic.

Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro car, bike-sharing users are exposed to the bike surface and take the transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike-sharing. METHODS: Based on the trip data of bike-sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the perspectives of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike-sharing during the pandemic. RESULTS: Pandemic control strategies sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly. Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and older adults may be more dependent on bike-sharing systems. The declined trips reduce user contacts and transmission risk. Central urban areas have more user close contacts and higher transmission risk than suburban areas. Besides, a new concept of user distancing is proposed to decrease transmission risk and the number of idle bikes. CONCLUSIONS: This paper is the first research focusing on both user demand and transmission risk of bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) coexist in the gut and regulate different processes such as motility, absorption/secretion and inflammation. We investigated the changes in expression of major angiotensin and dopamine receptors in the colon of male, female and ovariectomized female mice. Possible interaction between both systems was investigated using male and female mice deficient (ko) for major angiotensin and dopamine receptors. In wild type mice, colonic tissue from females showed lower angiotensin type 1 (AT1)/angiotensin type 2 (AT2) ratio (an index of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory RAS balance), lower dopamine D1 and D2 receptor expression, and lower levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers relative to males. Interestingly, ovariectomy increased the expression of pro-inflammatory AT1 receptor expression and decreased anti-inflammatory AT2 receptor expression, increased D1 and D2 receptor expression, and increased the levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers. Ovariectomy-induced changes were blocked by estrogen replacement. The present results suggest a mutual regulation between colonic angiotensin and dopamine receptors, and sex differences in this mutual regulation. Estrogen regulates changes in both angiotensin and dopamine receptor expression, which may be involved in sex- and surgical menopause-related effects on gut motility, permeability and vulnerability to inflammatory processes.","output":"Estrogen deficiency and colonic function: surgical menopause and sex differences in angiotensin and dopamine receptor interaction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their outstanding ability to be used in different sectors and serve in difficult and dangerous areas.

However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) with UAVs introduces several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which restricts their on-board computation. In this work, we present a strategy aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained UAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions. The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy that gives the best latency among the available UAVs.

METHODS: The clinical records of 1074 patients with chest high-resolution computed-tomography (HRCT) positive for interstitial pneumonia and symptoms compatible for COVID-19, hospitalized in medical wards during the first pandemic wave in a single academic center in Northern Italy, were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had serum PCT testing performed within six hours from admission. Information on COVID-19-related symptoms, comorbidities, drugs, autonomy in daily activities, respiratory exchanges, other routine lab tests, and outcomes were collected. Clinical characteristics were compared across different admission PCT levels and ages. The association of admission PCT with mortality was tested separately in participants aged > 75 and 75 years old by stepwise multivariate Cox regression model with forward selection. RESULTS: With increasing classes of PCT levels (<0.05, 0.05-0.49, 0.5-1.99, and 2 ng/ml), there was a significant trend (P < 0.0001) towards older age, male gender, wider extension of lung involvement on HRCT, worse respiratory exchanges, and several other laboratory abnormalities.

This lack also reduces our understanding of the epidemiology associated with S. suis in the United States and thus affects the efficiency of control and prevention strategies. In this study we applied whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches for the characterization of S. suis and identification of VAGs. RESULTS: Of 208 S. suis isolates classified as pathogenic, possibly opportunistic, and commensal pathotypes, the genotype based on the classical VAGs (epf, mrp, and sly encoding the extracellular protein factor, muramidase-release protein, and suilysin, respectively) was identified in 9% (epf+/mrp+/sly+) of the pathogenic pathotype. Using the chi-square test and LASSO regression model, the VAGs ofs (encoding the serum opacity factor) and srtF (encoding sortase F) were selected out of 71 published VAGs as having a significant association with pathotype, and both genes were found in 95% of the pathogenic pathotype. The ofs+/srtF+ genotype was also present in 74% of pathogenic isolates from a separate validation set of isolates. Pan-genome clustering resulted in the differentiation of a group of isolates from five swine production companies into clusters corresponding to clonal complex (CC) and virulence-associated (VA) genotypes. The same CC-VA genotype patterns were identified in multiple production companies, suggesting a lack of association between production company, CC, or VA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ofs and srtF genes were stronger predictors for differentiating pathogenic and commensal S. suis isolates compared to the classical VAGs in two sets of U.S. isolates. Pan-genome analysis in combination with metadata (serotype, ST/CC, VA genotype) was illustrated to be a valuable subtyping tool to describe the genetic diversity of S. suis.

We therefore aimed to assess the cytokine and chemokine profiles of children with MIS-C and compare these to life-threatening severe SARS-CoV-2 and healthy controls (HCs) to shed light on disease pathophysiology. METHODS: Samples of 31 children with MIS-C, 10 with severe/critical COVID-19 and 11 HCs were included. Cytokine and chemokine profiles were studied and compared in between groups.

METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%).

Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of 70% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those 60 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs 70%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness.

In addition to direct antiviral activities, type I IFN serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, the outcome of a viral infection can be affected by IFN induction and the IFN sensitivity of a virus. North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) field isolates were studied with regard to IFN- sensitivity and induction in order to understand the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis. PRRSV isolates were differentially sensitive to porcine recombinant IFN- (rIFN-) and varied in their ability to induce IFN- in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) cultures as measured by a porcine IFN- specific ELISA on cell culture supernatants. Fifty-two plaques were purified from three PRRSV isolates (numbers 3, 7, and 12) and tested for IFN sensitivity and IFN induction. Plaque-derived populations were composed of heterogeneous populations in terms of IFN-inducing capacity and sensitivity to rIFN-. When macrophages infected with isolates 3, 7, or 12 were treated with polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), IFN- production was enhanced. Cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C showed the most consistent and strongest enhancement of IFN- production. It was demonstrated that the relatively low concentrations of IFN- produced by isolate 3 contributed to the enhanced IFN- synthesis in response to polyI:C. Isolates 7 and 12 significantly suppressed the enhanced IFN- production by isolate 3 in polyI:C treated cells. To determine if suppression was at the level of IFN- transcription, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for IFN- mRNA and compared to GAPDH and cyclophilin mRNA quantification. However, the relative number of IFN- transcript copies did not correlate with IFN- protein levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of suppression. In summary, these results demonstrate that PRRSV field isolates differ both in IFN- sensitivity and induction. Furthermore, a PRRSV field isolate strongly enhance polyI:C-induced IFN- production in PAM cultures and this priming effect was suppressed by other PRRSV isolates.","output":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus field isolates differ in in vitro interferon phenotypes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to explore the shadow economy of violent extremism through charity lenses and factors associated with misuse of charitable giving in a global financial system.

This study aimed to investigate the spread of family violence and detect the predictors of it with the applied advanced statistical procedure, structural equation modeling (SEM). The researchers prepared the family violence scale that consisted of 21 items, and applied it in a random sample that consisted of (312) individual. The finding indicated that there are high levels of family violence, violence between spouses, violence from parents to children, and sibling violence. As well as, the findings found that the years of marriage are statistically significant of violence between spouses, violence from parents to children, and sibling violence, and the total score of the family violence. As well as, sex is a statistically significant predictor of violence between spouses. While the educational level, age, and income level did not predict violence (total score or dimensions).

Global burdens of drug-resistant TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens have a particular impact on paediatric age groups, necessitating a paediatric-focused agenda to address emerging resistance. Dedicated approaches are needed to find, successfully treat and prevent resistant infections in paediatric populations worldwide. Challenges include the diagnosis and identification of resistant infections, limited access to novel antimicrobials or to paediatric-friendly formulations, limited access to research and clinical trials and implementation challenges related to prevention and successful completion of treatment. In this review, the particular complexities of emerging resistance in TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens in children, with attention to both clinical and public health challenges, are highlighted. Key principles of a paediatric-focused agenda to address antimicrobial resistance are outlined. They include quality of care, increasing equitable access to key diagnostics, expanding antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention across global settings, and health system strengthening. Increased access to research studies, including clinical trials, is needed. Further study and implementation of care models and strategies for child- or adolescent-centred management of infections such as HIV and TB can critically improve outcome and avoid development of resistance.

METHODS In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the primary outcome was any 14-day related healthcare follow-up event(s). Secondary outcomes were the type of 14-day related follow-up event including hospital admission, emergency department visit, office visit, telehealth visit and/or multiple follow-up visits. Individual visit types were identified due to the significant difference between a hospital admission and an office visit. Logistic regressions were done using the predictors of visit type, age, gender and comorbidities and the primary outcome variable of a related follow-up visit and then by follow-up type: hospital admission, emergency department visit or office visit. RESULTS Of 1305 visits, median age was 42.3 years and 65.8% were female. Traditional office visits accounted for 741 (56.8%) of initial visits, while 564 (43.2%) visits occurred via telehealth. One hundred and forty-six (25.9%) of the telehealth visits resulted in a 14-day related healthcare follow-up visit versus 161 (21.7%) of the office visits (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58). DISCUSSION There was no significant difference in related follow-ups of initial telehealth visits compared to initial office visits including no significant difference in hospital admission or emergency department visits.

BACKGROUND Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery. METHODS Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. RESULTS Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142  39 ml vs. 171  72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9  6.8 min vs. 34.2  14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08  0.54 Gy vs. 1.29  0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3  1.0 mrem vs. 2.6  1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8  1.1 mrem vs. 1.8  2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients.

Understanding facilitators and challenges to adoption and perceptions of the quality of virtual care when delivered at scale can inform service planning postpandemic. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand consistent facilitators and persistent challenges to adoption of virtual care and perceived impact on quality of care in an initial pilot phase prior to the pandemic and then during scaled use during the pandemic in the mental health department of an ambulatory care hospital. METHODS: This study took place at Womens College Hospital, an academic ambulatory hospital located in Toronto, Canada. We utilized a multimethods approach to collect quantitative data through aggregate utilization data of phone, video, and in-person visits prior to and during COVID-19 lockdown measures and through a provider experience survey administered to mental health providers (n=30). Qualitative data were collected through open-ended questions on provider experience surveys, focus groups (n=4) with mental health providers, and interviews with clinical administrative and implementation hospital staff (n=3). RESULTS: Utilization data demonstrated slower uptake of video visits at launch and prior to COVID-19 lockdown measures in Ontario (pre-March 2020) and subsequent increased uptake of phone and video visits during COVID-19 lockdown measures (post-March 2020). Mental health providers and clinic staff highlighted barriers and facilitators to adoption of virtual care at the operational, behavioral, cultural, and system/policy levels such as required changes in workflows and scheduling, increased provider effort, provider and staff acceptance, and billing codes for physician providers. Much of the described provider experiences focused on perceived impact on quality of mental health care delivery, including perceptions on providing appropriate and patient-centered care, virtual care effectiveness, and equitable access to care for patients. CONCLUSIONS: Continued efforts to enhance suggested facilitators, reduce persistent challenges, and address provider concerns about care quality based on these findings can enable a hybrid model of patient-centered and appropriate care to emerge in the future, with options for in-person, video, and phone visits being used to meet patient and clinical needs as required.","output":"Delivering Mental Health Care Virtually During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Evaluation of Provider Experiences in a Scaled Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research paper, we study the performance of an innovative broad band rectenna that has been designed based on the combination of an antipodal Vivaldi broad band antenna and an efficient NULT RF-DC rectifier The antenna have showed a directive pattern and an ultra-wide bandwidth of 1 66 GHz stating from 0 8GHz to 2 45GHz The realized rectenna can harvest the ambient power of 4 major used frequency bands (0 8, 1 8, 2 1 and 2 45 GHz) The realized antenna is followed by a NULT impedance matching and rectifier in which the use of SMS 7630 Schottky diodes was essential to transform the harvested radiofrequency power into a useful DC power The NULT prototype has shown an acceptable harvesting efficiency results at 3 of our frequency bands of interest Due to the lack of access to professional test equipment caused by the major lockdown by COVID-19, the rectenna prototype was tested in uncontrolled environment and it was able to harvest 0 9 V at the distance of 3 m from 4 cell phones during communications ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Broad Band Rectenna Based on Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna and NULT Rectifier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drought has been highly prevalent around the world especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asian countries.

By mid-July 2020, reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000 deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness, hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able to express the non-stationary relationships among variables. Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.","output":"Sociodemographic determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates in Oman: Geospatial modelling using multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Official development assistance (ODA) is one of the most important means for donor countries to foster diplomatic relations with low- and middle-income countries and contribute to the welfare of the international community.Objective: This study estimated the sectoral allocation of gross disbursements of ODA of the 29 Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for the duration of 2011 to 2018, by aid type (bilateral, multilateral, and both aids).Methods: Data from the OECD iLibrary were used.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted the first systematic review of SIDS-related publications in Africa. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of SIDS and its risk factors in Africa. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to identify studies published until December 26, 2020. Review authors screened titles and abstracts, and selected articles independently for full-text review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) or a modification. Data on the proportion of infants who died of SIDS and reported prevalence of any risk factors were extracted using customized data extraction forms in Covidence. RESULTS: Our analysis rested on 32 peer-reviewed articles. Nine studies presented prevalence estimates on bedsharing and prone sleeping, suggesting near-universal bedsharing of infants with parents (range, 60 to 91.8%) and frequent use of the prone sleeping position (range, 26.7 to 63.8%). Eleven studies reported on the prevalence of SIDS, suggesting high rates of SIDS in Africa. The prevalence of SIDS ranged from 3.7 per 1000 live births in South Africa, 2.5 per 1000 live births in Niger, and 0.2 per 1000 live births in Zimbabwe. SIDS and other sudden infant deaths accounted for between 2.5 to 21% of infant deaths in South Africa and 11.3% in Zambia.

Federal legislation has responded to emergent public-health needs by removing barriers that have impeded widespread adoption of telehealth modalities. This legislation has omitted professional registered nurses (RNs) from delivering reimbursable telehealth services, which is problematic for primary-care practice. RNs historically have led telehealth service delivery and should therefore be included in new legislation as eligible health professionals permitted to provide reimbursable telehealth services. RNs improve quality outcomes in primary care within innovative team-based care models and are essential clinicians capable of providing ongoing care coordination and disease management for patients needing to stay on track with their usual care needs.","output":"Primary-care registered nurse telehealth policy implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus epidemic that is spreading around our world poses a number of challenges for healthcare workers. The virus is spread by droplet infection and has a high virulence, so any intervention that generates airway aerosol formation potentially endangers the health of those involved in care. Severe forms of coronavirus infection are associated with progressive respiratory failure, for the treatment of which early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are essential. There is an increased risk of airway aerosol formation during intubation, resulting in a high risk of infection for care personnel. In addition to the above, difficult airway insurance is relatively common in these patients. The aim of our article is to provide a practice-oriented overview of the specialties of airway insurance in patients infected with coronavirus, with particular reference to aspects of infection control and patient safety.

However, given that poor mental health is common in acute medical staff, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of work involving high exposure to infected patients. METHODS: We report a rapid review, meta-analysis, and living meta-analysis of studies using validated measures from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: A random effects meta-analysis found that high-exposure work is not associated with an increased prevalence of above cut-off scoring (anxiety: RR = 1.30, 95% CI 0.87C1.93, Total N = 12,473; PTSD symptoms: RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.75C1.78, Total N = 6604; depression: RR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.57C3.95, Total N = 12,224). For continuous scoring, high-exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low-exposure work (anxiety: SMD = 0.16, 95% CI 0.02C0.31, Total N = 6493; PTSD symptoms: SMD = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01C0.40, Total N = 5122; depression: SMD = 0.13, 95% CI -0.04C0.31, Total N = 4022). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Although epidemic and pandemic response work may add only a small additional burden, improving mental health through service management and provision of mental health services should be a priority given that baseline rates of poor mental health are already very high.

As flipped classroom models of instruction have gained popularity in higher education, it has prompted the need for an investigation into content-specific methods for flipped curriculum design. Our work identified and implemented flipped classroom design factors in an Advanced Database Design (CIT 44400) course to address a gap in research around flipped classroom models within undergraduate data-science courses. Through literature review, we identified a set of eight factors of effective flipped classroom instruction and evaluated them via survey, focus group, course evaluation, student performance, and interview data. We segmented designed course activities which incorporated these eight factors with a set of learning objectives that emphasized collaborative iterative practices to position students as designers and evaluators of solutions to industry-authentic problems. Instructional design factors were evaluated via course evaluations and student surveys followed by an activity-based qualitative analysis of focus group, instructor interview, and student free-response data to understand student perceptions of instructional approaches, intended versus practical outcomes of such activities, and guidelines for future course design iterations and research. We argue instructional design must be student-centered and consider student goals alongside those that are 'scripted' into the course structure to best serve, motivate, and engage students. During the Fall 2020 implementation of CIT 44400, we prioritized learner independence, peer collaboration, and critical thinking in the instructional design, selecting flipped methodologies with the intention of fostering these skills in senior students. In light of Covid-19, the course was adapted to be synchronous online. Regardless of these unforeseen constraints, student performance and course evaluation data indicate that with peer and instructor feedback, students were able to apply course content appropriately in their final independent project as evidenced by a 12% increase in assessment scores and an improvement in students average overall final course grades from a 'B' to an 'A-' as compared to the previously taught Fall 2019 lecture-based section of the same class. Course evaluation scores also improved from 3.22 to 3.66 from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. Self-reported survey data from students indicate that (a) feedback from the instructor, (b) small group work, (c) revision of work based on feedback, and (d) solution evaluations were the most positively impactful instructional design elements throughout the course. In particular, students mentioned one-on-one scaffolding from the instructor as beneficial for their learning. Students also communicated challenges faced during the pandemic, complaints, and recommendations for future course iterations. Data from focus group discussions conveyed that students (a) generally had positive learning experiences despite the constraints of learning exclusively online and (b) developed the industry-specific collaborative practices which were designed into the forefront of our instructional model. The flipped classroom design and implementation process in this research is transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to design a domain-specific flipped model for their classroom which considers the needs of one's students, the challenges of the current time, and the state of the field at large. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Evaluating Factors for Effective Flipped Classroom Instruction in an Advanced Data Management Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy/safety of tofacitinib in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was employed consisting of online quantitative surveys. METHOD: We gathered background engagement and motivation data from 115 athletes involved in organized sport. They responded to questions on basic psychological needs satisfaction (competence, relatedness, autonomy) and athlete identity. RESULTS: When reflecting on their basic psychological needs during the pandemic, most athletes considered them important. Athletes' competence and relatedness in sport were associated with social-related athlete identity, but not autonomy. Only relatedness in sport was associated with exclusivity-related social identity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to adapt how we communicate with patients families due to hospital visiting restrictions. In an era where tragically deterioration and death have been much more commonplace, we looked to identify areas where junior doctors felt their communication skills could be improved, and implemented a teaching programme to deliver this. METHODS: Pre-teaching questionnaires were distributed to a range of grades of junior doctors working in University Hospital of Llandough, Cardiff. The questionnaires were distributed at the beginning of June 2020, after 3 months of working in pandemic conditions. A teaching session on telephone and video communication skills was delivered by a local palliative care consultant. Post-teaching, a repeat questionnaire was undertaken to assess response and identify key learning points. RESULTS: Pre-teaching, 100% of the 22 respondents had had to participate in difficult conversations over the phone, 82% had had no formal phone based communication skills training and 81.82% felt some form of formal teaching would be helpful. Post-teaching, 12 junior doctors provided feedback with an average 37% increase in confidence to undertake difficult conversations. Key learning points from the session highlighted the importance of preparation, regularly updating the family to build trust and rapport, and integrating family updates via tele-communication into daily ward life. CONCLUSIONS: Education around telephone communication skills is critical to enable us to adapt our skills in accordance with the demands of the pandemic, to continue to support relatives and to engage with technology with confidence.

HYPOTHESIS Individual risk factors in athletes with shoulder instability who are managed nonoperatively can be integrated into a scoring system that can predict successful return to sport. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 4. METHODS A total of 57 scholastic athletes with primary anterior shoulder instability who were managed nonoperatively were reviewed. Success was defined as a return to index sport at the same level and playing at least 1 subsequent season without missed time as a result of the shoulder. Patient-specific risk factors were individually evaluated, and odds ratios were calculated. A 10-point Nonoperative Injury Severity Index Score (NISIS) incorporated the risk factors for failure. This score was then retrospectively applied with regression analysis and a chi-square analysis to determine the overall optimal score that predicted failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS In total, 6 risk factors for failure were included in the NISIS: age (>15 years), bone loss, type of instability, type of sport (contact vs noncontact), male sex, and arm dominance. Overall, 79% of patients treated nonoperatively were able to successfully return to sport. Nearly all (97%) low-risk patients (NISIS <7) successfully returned to sport, while only 59% of high-risk patients returned to sport, a relative risk of 12.2 (P = 0.001). High-risk patients with unipolar bone loss successfully returned (100%), but 67% of high-risk patients with bipolar bone loss failed. CONCLUSION The NISIS is a simple and effective clinical tool to determine successful nonoperative management following anterior shoulder instability and may be helpful in guiding decision making when presented with the unstable shoulder in the scholastic athlete.","output":"The Nonoperative Instability Severity Index Score (NISIS): A Simple Tool to Guide Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of the Unstable Shoulder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected health care priorities. OBJECTIVE: To explore and analyse trends in public online search for urological cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Google Health Trends online tool. Data related to urological cancer terms (prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer) were extracted. We analysed trends for the whole world and for five countries: Italy, the UK, France, Sweden, and the USA. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A join-point regression model was used to define significant changes in trends over time. Week percentage changes (WPCs) were estimated to summarise linear trends. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the search volume during the COVID-19 pandemic period (from January 2020 to April 2021) and the equivalent period of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: During COVID-19, worldwide online interest decreased significantly for all urological cancers, especially prostate cancer (WPC: C13.9%, p = 0.004; WPC: C5.4%, p < 0.001; and WPC: C4.3%, p < 0.001, for prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers, respectively).

However, the role of the immune system in mediating these clinical outcomes has not been determined. We used multi-parameter flow cytometry and systems serology to comprehensively profile the functions of T cells and antibodies targeting spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins in a convalescent cohort of COVID-19 subjects who were either hospitalized (n=20) or not hospitalized (n=40). To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4 T-cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects that were not hospitalized. These data reveal a functionally diverse and coordinated response between T cells and antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 which is reduced in the presence of comorbid illnesses that are known risk factors for severe COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE To describe the techniques of RPL and RNL, and present multi-center outcome data for patients undergoing these procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a retrospective analysis of 27 patients undergoing RPL and RNL at five tertiary academic institutions between 2008 and 2014. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RPL and RNL without use of renal ischemia. MEASUREMENTS We assessed stone clearance by visual assessment and postoperative imaging. We also examined other factors, including complications (Clavien grade), estimated blood loss, operative time, and length of stay. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Twenty-seven patients underwent 28 procedures for a mean renal stone size of 2.74cm (standard deviation: 1.4, range: 0.8-5.8). The mean stone volume was 10.2cm3. RPL accounted for 26 of these procedures. RNL was performed in one patient, while another underwent combined RPL-RNL. Indications included failed previous endourological management (13), staghorn calculi (five), gas containing stone (one), calyceal diverticulum (one), complex urinary tract reconstruction (two), and patient preference (four). The mean patient age was 35.6 yr and mean body mass index was 25.5kg/m2. Mean operative time/console times were 182min and 128min, respectively. The mean estimated blood loss was 38ml. The mean length of stay was 1.7 d. There was no significant change in preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine levels. The overall complication rate was 18.5% (Clavien 1=3.7%; 2=7.4%; 3b=7.4%). The complete stone-free rate was 96%. CONCLUSIONS RPL and RNL are safe and reasonable options for removing renal stones in select patients. In particular, RPL allows the removal of stones without transgressing the parenchyma, reducing potential bleeding and nephron loss.

RESULTS: Participants preferred drive-through clinics as their top location for COVID-19 testing, with 55% reporting this was their preferred method of testing. This pattern was consistent across all comparison groups (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status). Significant differences in testing location preference were observed across age, race and ethnicity, and education, with the most differences observed across race and ethnicity.

Our objective was to determine whether an in vitro model of ARDS can recapitulate the same AM functional defect observed in vivo and be used to further investigate pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: AMs were isolated from the lung tissue of patients undergoing lobectomy and then treated with pooled bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid previously collected from patients with ARDS. AM phenotype and effector functions (efferocytosis and phagocytosis) were assessed by flow cytometry. Rac1 gene expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: ARDS BAL treatment of AMs decreased efferocytosis (p = 0.0006) and Rac1 gene expression (p = 0.016); however, bacterial phagocytosis was preserved. Expression of AM efferocytosis receptors MerTK (p = 0.015) and CD206 (p = 0.006) increased, whereas expression of the antiefferocytosis receptor SIRP decreased following ARDS BAL treatment (p = 0.036). Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition partially restored AM efferocytosis in an in vitro model of ARDS (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Treatment of lung resection tissue AMs with ARDS BAL fluid induces impairment in efferocytosis similar to that observed in patients with ARDS. However, AM phagocytosis is preserved following ARDS BAL treatment. This specific impairment in AM efferocytosis can be partially restored by inhibition of ROCK.

Alterations to the regulation of autophagy contribute to the progression of various rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Implicit in the progression of these diseases are cell-type-specific responses to surrounding factors that alter autophagy: chondrocytes within articular cartilage show decreased autophagy in OA, leading to rapid cell death and cartilage degeneration; fibroblasts from patients with SSc have restricted autophagy, similar to that seen in aged dermal fibroblasts; fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA joints show altered autophagy, which contributes to synovial hyperplasia; and dysregulation of autophagy in haematopoietic lineage cells alters their function and maturation in SLE. Various upstream mechanisms also contribute to these diseases by regulating autophagy as part of their signalling cascades.

Despite the potential usefulness of system dynamics simulation modelling and other systems science modelling techniques in guiding implementation, time and cost constraints have limited its ability to provide strong guidance on how to implement complex interventions in communities. Guidance is required to ensure systems interventions lead to impactful systems solutions, implemented utilising strategies from the intersecting fields of systems science and implementation science. To provide cost-effective guidance on how and where to implement in systems, we offer a translation of the Meadows 12 places to act in a system (Meadows 12) into language useful for public health. METHODS: This translation of Meadows 12 was informed by our experience in working with 31 communities across two complex large scale randomised control trials and one large whole of community case study. These research projects utilised systems science and implementation science to co-create childhood obesity prevention interventions. The team undertaking this translation comprised research academics, implementation specialists and practitioners, practice-based researchers and a systems dynamicist. Our translation of each of the Meadows 12 levels to act in the system maintains the fidelity and nuance of the 12 distinct levels. We provide examples of each level of the Public Health 12 framework (PH12) drawn from 31 communities. All research was conducted in Victoria, Australia between 2016 and 2020. RESULTS: PH12 provides a framework to guide both research and practice in real world contexts to implement targeted system level interventions. PH12 can be used with existing implementation science theory to identify relevant strategies for implementation of these interventions to impact the system at each of the leverage points. CONCLUSION: To date little guidance for public health practitioners and researchers exists regarding how to implement systems change in community-led public health interventions. PH12 enables operationalisation Meadows 12 systems theory into public health interventions. PH12 can help research and practice determine where leverage can be applied in the system to optimise public health systems level interventions and identify gaps in existing efforts.

Independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types, type I, the original FCoV, and type II, which is closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV). The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types. These findings demonstrate that in FIP cases FCoV type I predominates, too, nonetheless, in 14% of the cases FCoV type II was detected, suggesting its causative involvement in cases of FIP.","output":"Prevalence of feline coronavirus types I and II in cats with histopathologically verified feline infectious peritonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective implementation of infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities depends on training, awareness and compliance of healthcare workers. In Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have resulted from lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures. This study was designed to assess attitudes to, and awareness of, infection prevention and control policies and guidelines among healthcare workers of different professions and institution types in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was administered to 607 healthcare workers including physicians (n = 133), nurses (n = 162), laboratory staff (n = 233) and other staff (n = 79) in government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. Results were compared using Chi square analysis according to profession type, institution type, age group and nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi) to assess variability. Responses suggested that there are relatively high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers across a range of infection prevention and control issues, including institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence to suggest that staff in private hospitals and nurses were more confident than other staff types. Carelessness of healthcare workers was the top-cited factor contributing to causes of outbreaks (65.07% of total group), and hospital infrastructure and design was the top-cited factor contributing to spread of infection in the hospital (54.20%), followed closely by lack and shortage of staff (53.71%) and no infection control training program (51.73%). An electronic surveillance system was considered the most effective by staff (81.22%).

DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over feasibility trial in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTIONS: After two-week run-in participants were randomized to either ZS (encapsulated granules; 2 g daily) or placebo for four weeks. After four-weeks wash-out, participants swapped to the other treatment for four weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep quality assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Quality of life, mood, functional impairment and sleep parameters were also assessed. RESULTS: Twelve participants were randomized and completed both periods of cross-over (six in each sequence). Feasibility endpoints were acceptable. Improvements for sleep quality measured on the PSQI were statistically significant during the ZS treatment periods compared to placebo (t = -2.276, df = 10, 95% CI -3.3 to -0.04, p = 0.046). There was no evidence of any significant carryover effects. However, there were period effects. Other outcomes showed no statistically significant difference between the treatments. Subjective sleep parameters measured on sleep diaries showed improvements after ZS in terms of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency, but not after placebo. ZS was well tolerated with only minor adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: ZS is an acceptable and well-tolerated herbal candidate for the treatment of insomnia.

UDG depletion sensitizes cells to high APOBEC3B deaminase and to pemetrexed (PEM) and floxuridine (5-FdU), which are toxic to tumor cells through incorporation of uracil and 5-FU into DNA. To identify small-molecule UDG inhibitors for pre-clinical evaluation, we optimized biochemical screening of a selected diversity collection of >3,000 small-molecules. We found aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as an inhibitor of purified UDG at an initial calculated IC(50) < 100 nM. Subsequent enzymatic assays confirmed effective ATA inhibition but with an IC(50) of 700 nM and showed direct binding to the human UDG with a K(D) of <700 nM. ATA displays preferential, dose-dependent binding to purified human UDG compared to human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase. ATA did not bind uracil-containing DNA at these concentrations. Yet, combined crystal structure and in silico docking results unveil ATA interactions with the DNA binding channel and uracil-binding pocket in an open, destabilized UDG conformation. Biologically relevant ATA inhibition of UDG was measured in cell lysates from human DLD1 colon cancer cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using a host cell reactivation assay.

Results show that a higher outdoor temperature leads to lower droplets diffusion speed and longer time until the droplets reach the driver. In addition, based on the integral concentration of droplets at the seats, regardless of whether a passenger exhales droplets in the front row of the bus, the position of the rear door or the last row of the bus, the seats in the last row of the bus away from the door belong to the low-risk area. In contrast, the seats near the door and the middle seat in the bus are higher risk areas. Consequently, this study proposed sitting on a seat in the low-risk area as a means to reduce the risk of passengers.

As of 12 April 2020, this outbreak has spread to more than 210 countries and territories and caused 108,837 deaths. The development of this outbreak has resulted in the closure of several major cities in the world (such as Wuhan, Daegu, and Manila) to country-wide lockdowns as observed in Italy and Malaysia. This also affects the construction sector as a labor-intensive industry. Force majeure has become one of the critical points of discussion, considering that this provision allows a contract party to hinder from fulfilling its obligations on the grounds that events are beyond a partys control. Nevertheless, the application of this provision often faces challenges considering that in prior legal cases, the Courts tend to interpret this clause narrowly. Thus, it would be problematic when the force majeure clause does not include an epidemic outbreak as a force majeure event in the contract. This paper aims to explore the potential of the COVID-19 outbreak as a force majeure event in construction contracts. A qualitative approach consisting of two-step interdependent methods was done to highlight the fundamental elements of force majeure and to analyze whether the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a force majeure event or not.

With this study we aimed to further unravel the mechanism by which IL-22 exerts its effects and to decipher its therapeutic potential by overexpression of IL-22 either locally or systemically during experimental arthritis. METHODS CIA was induced in DBA-1 mice by immunization and booster injection with type II collagen (col II). Before arthritis onset, IL-22 was overexpressed either locally by intra-articular injection or systemically by i.v. injection using an adenoviral vector and clinical arthritis was scored for a period of 10 days. Subsequently, joints were isolated for histological analysis of arthritis severity and mRNA and protein expression of various inflammatory mediators was determined in the synovium, spleen and serum. RESULTS Local IL-22 overexpression did not alter arthritis pathology, whereas systemic overexpression of IL-22 potently reduced disease incidence, severity and pathology during CIA. Mice systemically overexpressing IL-22 showed strongly reduced serum cytokine levels of TNF- and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 that correlated significantly with the enhanced expression of the negative immune regulator SOCS3 in the spleen.

Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth. METHODS: We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010C20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, and small-for-gestational-age status. FINDINGS: Data on 1 599 547 singleton neonates were available, including 56 720 births that occurred after implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 ( 2 months [n=531 823] odds ratio [OR] 077, 95% CI 066C091, p=00026;  3 months [n=796 531] OR 085, 073C098, p=0028;  4 months [n=1 066 872] OR 084, 073C097, p=0023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

The initial strategy for treating periodontal disease is non-surgical sanative therapy (ST). Periodontal disease can also induce dysbiosis in the gut microbiota and contribute to low-grade systemic inflammation. Prebiotic fibers such as inulin can selectively alter the intestinal microbiota and support homeostasis by improving gut barrier functions and preventing inflammation. Providing an inulin supplement prior to and post-ST may influence periodontal health while providing insight into the complex relationship between periodontal disease and the gut microbiota. The primary objective is to determine if inulin is more effective than the placebo at improving clinical periodontal outcomes including probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Secondary objectives include determining the effects of inulin supplementation pre- and post-ST on salivary markers of inflammation and periodontal-associated pathogens, as these outcomes reflect more rapid changes that can occur. METHODS: We will employ a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design and recruit and randomize 170 participants who are receiving ST to manage the periodontal disease to the intervention (inulin) or placebo (maltodextrin) group. A pilot study will be embedded within the randomized controlled trial using the first 48 participants to test the feasibility for the larger, powered trial. The intervention period will begin 4 weeks before ST through to their follow-up appointment at 10 weeks post-ST. Clinical outcomes of periodontal disease including the number of sites with PD  4 mm and the presence of BOP will be measured at baseline and post-ST. Salivary markers of inflammation, periodontal-associated pathogens, body mass index, and diet will be measured at baseline, pre-ST (after 4 weeks of intervention), and post-ST (after 14 weeks of intervention). DISCUSSION: We expect that inulin will enhance the positive effect of ST on the management of periodontal disease. The results of the study will provide guidance regarding the use of prebiotics prior to and as a supportive adjunct to ST for periodontal health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04670133.

Positive evolutionary selection of mutations within the spike protein has led to the genesis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with greatly enhanced overall fitness. Given the trend of variants with increased fitness arising from spike protein alterations, it is critical that the scientific community understand the mechanisms by which these mutations alter viral functions. As of March 2022, five SARS-CoV-2 strains were labeled variants of concern by the World Health Organization: the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. This review summarizes the potential mechanisms by which the common mutations on the spike protein that occur within these strains enhance the overall fitness of their respective variants. In addressing these mutations within the context of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure, spike/receptor binding interface, spike/antibody binding, and virus neutralization, we summarize the general paradigms that can be used to estimate the effects of future mutations along SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","output":"Mutations and Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two teaching hospitals over a 3-month period (March 2010-June 2020) comparing severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) and subjected to awake prone position (PP) with those receiving standard care (SC). Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRa?=a?0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pa?=a?0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRa?=a?0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pa?=a?0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRa?=a?0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pa?=a?0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC. Although our results are intriguing, further randomized controlled trials are needed to answer all the open questions remaining pending about the real efficacy of PP in this setting.","output":"Early awake proning in critical and severe COVID-19 patients undergoing noninvasive respiratory support: A retrospective multicenter cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have reported clinical manifestations of the new coronavirus disease.

We used clustering approach to categorize clinical symptoms. One hundred and fifty-one patients showed at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. Limb force reductions, headache followed by anosmia, hypogeusia were among the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that neuropsychiatric symptoms group together in three distinct groups: anosmia and hypogeusia; dizziness, headache, and limb force reduction; photophobia, mental state change, hallucination, vision and speech problem, seizure, stroke, and balance disturbance. Three non-neuropsychiatric cluster of symptoms included diarrhea and nausea; cough and dyspnea; and fever and weakness. Neuropsychiatric presentations are very prevalent and heterogeneous in patients with coronavirus 2 infection and these heterogeneous presentations may be originating from different underlying mechanisms.

The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION: The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises.

However, the ability of broilers to respond to three or four different antigenic types of IBV vaccine has not been examined experimentally. In this study, we vaccinated one-day-old broiler chicks by eyedrop with three or four different IBV vaccine types simultaneously. The presence and relative amount of each vaccine was examined in all of the birds by IBV type-specific real-time RT-PCR at 5 days post-vaccination and each vaccine was detected in all of the birds given that vaccine. The birds were challenged at 28 days of age and protection was measured by clinical signs, virus detection and by ciliostasis. Birds vaccinated with three different IBV types (Ark, Mass and GA98) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types and were partially protected against challenge with the GA08 virus. Birds vaccinated with four different IBV types (Ark, Mass, GA98 and GA08) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types with the exception of Mass challenged birds which clearly had 3/11 birds not protected based on individual ciliostasis scores, but had an average ciliostasis score of >50% which is considered protected.

Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Especially, damage, pathogen, and lifestyle-associated molecular patterns are the major factors in initiating baseline inflammatory diseases, particularly in cardiac pathology. After a significant cardiac injury like a heart attack, splenic and circulating leukocytes begin a highly optimized sequence of immune cell recruitment (neutrophils and monocytes) to coordinate effective tissue repair. An injured cardiac tissue repair and homeostasis are dependent on clearance of cellular debris where the recruited leukocytes transition from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative program through resolution process. After a cardiac injury, macrophages play a decisive role in cardiac repair through the biosynthesis of endogenous lipid mediators that ensure a timely tissue repair while avoiding chronic inflammation and impaired cardiac repair. However, dysregulation of resolution of inflammation processes due to cardiometabolic defects (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes), aging, or co-medication(s) lead to impaired cardiac repair. Hence, the presented review demonstrates the fundamental role of leukocytes, in particular macrophages orchestrate the inflammation and resolution biology, focusing on the biosynthesis of specialized lipid mediators in cardiac repair and heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: Identify changes in the health (mental health, physical activity and quality of life) of athletes that occurred during the CoVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 3243 Wisconsin adolescent athletes (age=16.21.2 yrs., female=58% female) completed an online survey in May 2020 (DuringCoVID-19). Health measures for this cohort were compared with previously reported data for Wisconsin adolescent athletes (n=5231, age=15.71.2, 47% female) collected in 2016-2018 (PreCoVID-19). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic information included: sex, grade and sports played. Health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) to identify depression symptoms, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for health related quality of life (HRQoL). Univariable comparisons of these variables between groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group were estimated by survey weighted ANOVA models. RESULTS: Compared to PreCoVID-19, a larger proportion of the During-CoVID-19 participants reported rates of moderate to severe levels of depression (9.7% vs 32.9%, p<0.001).

However, contrary to WHO recommendations based on scientific research and evidence, governmental discoursesparticularly in countries under the rule of right-wing conservatives, such as Brazil and the US--almost solely emphasized concerns about impact of the pandemic on the economy, pushing for a reopening of business as usual while disregarding the deadly impact of COVID-19 on those considered essential workers.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of CD19-targeted or B cell maturation antigenCtargeted (BCMA-targeted) CAR-T cell therapy recipients at least 6 months posttreatment and in remission. We measured pathogen-specific IgG against 12 vaccine-preventable infections and the number of viral and bacterial epitopes to which IgG was detected (epitope hits) using a serological profiling assay. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with IgG levels above a threshold correlated with seroprotection for vaccine-preventable infections. RESULTS: We enrolled 65 children and adults a median of 20 months after CD19- (n = 54) or BCMA- (n = 11) CAR-T cell therapy. Among 30 adults without IgG replacement therapy (IGRT) in the prior 16 weeks, 27 (90%) had hypogammaglobulinemia. These individuals had seroprotection to a median of 67% (IQR, 59%C73%) of tested infections. Proportions of participants with seroprotection per pathogen were comparable to population-based studies, but most individuals lacked seroprotection to specific pathogens. Compared with CD19-CAR-T cell recipients, BCMA-CAR-T cell recipients were half as likely to have seroprotection (prevalence ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18C1.25) and had fewer pathogen-specific epitope hits (mean difference, C90 epitope hits; 95% CI, C157 to C22). CONCLUSION: Seroprotection for vaccine-preventable infections in adult CD19-CAR-T cell recipients was comparable to the general population. BCMA-CAR-T cell recipients had fewer pathogen-specific antibodies. Deficits in both groups support the need for vaccine and immunoglobulin replacement therapy studies.

As an example, we focus on the so-called Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), but the approach is equally applicable to other coherent risk measures. Both the full and reduced space formulations are considered. The algorithm is based on low rank tensor approximations of random fields discretized using stochastic collocation. To avoid non-smoothness of the objective function underpinning the CVaR, we propose an adaptive strategy to select the width parameter of the smoothed CVaR to balance the smoothing and tensor approximation errors. Moreover, unbiased Monte Carlo CVaR estimate can be computed by using the smoothed CVaR as a control variate. To accelerate the computations, we introduce an efficient preconditioner for the KKT system in the full space formulation.The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate CVaR optimization constrained by large-scale discretized systems. In particular, the first example consists of an elliptic PDE with random coefficients as constraints. The second example is motivated by a realistic application to devise a lockdown plan for United Kingdom under COVID-19.

The underlying assumption in these models, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, is that the change in variables E, I or R at time t is dependent on a fraction of E and I at time t. This means that after exposed on a day, this individual may become contagious or even recover on the same day. However, the real situation is different: an exposed individual will become infectious after a latent period (l) and then recover after an infectious period (i). In this study, we proposed a new SEIR model based on the latent period-infectious period chronological order (Liu X., Results Phys. 2021; 20:103712). An analytical solution to equations of this new SEIR model was derived. From this new SEIR model, we obtained a propagated curve of infectious cases under conditions l>i. Similar propagated epidemic curves were reported in literature. However, the conventional SEIR model failed to simulate the propagated epidemic curves under the same conditions. For l<i, the new SEIR models generated bell-shaped curves for infectious cases, and the curve is near symmetrical to the vertical line passing the curve peak. This characteristic can be found in many epidemic curves of daily COVID-19 cases reported from different countries. However, the curve generated from the conventional SEIR model is a right-skewed bell-shaped curve.

METHODS: This study included all patients (n = 8070) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and individuals without COVID-19 (n = 121,050) in South Korea from January 1 to May 30, 2020. The study variables included officially registered disability status from the government, SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, and major adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death). RESULTS: The study participants included 129,120 individuals (including 7261 PwDs), of whom 8070 (6.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, PwDs had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity compared with people without disabilities (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.48).

The realization of a carbon-neutral environment is the main focus of science and academic researchers of today. Several processes were employed to minimize carbon dioxide in the air, some of which include the utilization of non-fossil sources of energy like solar, nuclear, and biomass-based fuels. Consequently, these sources were reported to have a relatively high cost of production and maintenance. The applications of both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in carbon capture and storage were investigated in recent years and the focus now is on the conversion of CO(2) into useful chemicals and compounds. It was established that CO(2) can undergo cycloaddition reaction with epoxides under the influence of special catalysts to give cyclic carbonates, which can be used as value-added chemicals at a different level of pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Among the various catalysts studied for this reaction, metal-organic frameworks are now on the frontline as a potential catalyst due to their special features and easy synthesis.

Such a model would allow investigation of research questions of physiological and therapeutic importance. We therefore aimed to develop a preterm lamb model of the non-intubated very preterm infant on CPAP. METHODS After staged exteriorisation and instrumentation, preterm lambs were delivered from anaesthetised ewes at 131 to 133 days gestation. Via a single nasal prong (4-mm internal diameter, 6- to 7-cm depth), positive pressure was delivered from the outset, with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) used until transition to nasal CPAP was attempted, and periodically thereafter for hypoventilation. Caffeine and doxapram were used as respiratory stimulants. Gastric distension was prevented with an oesophageal balloon. Cardiorespiratory parameters and results of arterial blood gas analyses were monitored throughout the study period, which continued for 150 min after first transition to CPAP. RESULTS Ten preterm lambs were studied, at gestation 132  1 days (mean  SD) and birth weight 3.6  0.45 kg. After stabilisation on NIPPV, transition to nasal CPAP was first attempted at 28  11 min. There was transient respiratory acidosis, with gradual resolution as spontaneous respiratory activity increased.

However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies.

Both can potentially interfere with cytoskeleton organization, cell membrane bending and cell function, suggesting altered cell morpho-rheological properties like cell deformability and other cell mechanical features in depressive disorders. We performed a cross-sectional case-control study using the image-based morpho-rheological characterization of unmanipulated blood samples facilitating real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC). Sixty-nine pre-screened individuals at high risk for depressive disorders and 70 matched healthy controls were included and clinically evaluated by Composite International Diagnostic Interview leading to lifetime and 12-month diagnoses. Facilitating deep learning on blood cell images, major blood cell types were classified and morpho-rheological parameters such as cell size and cell deformability of every individual cell was quantified. We found peripheral blood cells to be more deformable in patients with depressive disorders compared to controls, while cell size was not affected. Lifetime persistent depressive disorder was associated with increased cell deformability in monocytes and neutrophils, while in 12-month persistent depressive disorder erythrocytes deformed more. Lymphocytes were more deformable in 12-month major depressive disorder, while for lifetime major depressive disorder no differences could be identified. After correction for multiple testing, only associations for lifetime persistent depressive disorder remained significant. This is the first study analyzing morpho-rheological properties of entire blood cells and highlighting depressive disorders and in particular persistent depressive disorders to be associated with increased blood cell deformability. While all major blood cells tend to be more deformable, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils are mostly affected. This indicates that immune cell mechanical changes occur in depressive disorders, which might be predictive of persistent immune response.","output":"Depressive disorders are associated with increased peripheral blood cell deformability: a cross-sectional case-control study (Mood-Morph)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New Zealand delayed the introduction of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 into the community by the continued use of strict border controls through to January 2022. This allowed time for vaccination rates to increase and the roll out of third doses of the vaccine (boosters) to begin. It also meant more data on the characteristics of Omicron became available prior to the first cases of community transmission. Here we present a mathematical model of an Omicron epidemic, incorporating the effects of the booster roll out and waning of vaccine-induced immunity, and based on estimates of vaccine effectiveness and disease severity from international data. The model considers differing levels of immunity against infection, severe illness and death, and ignores waning of infection-induced immunity. This model was used to provide an assessment of the potential impact of an Omicron wave in the New Zealand population, which helped inform government preparedness and response. At the time the modelling was carried out, the date of introduction of Omicron into the New Zealand community was unknown. We therefore simulated outbreaks with different start dates, as well as investigating different levels of booster uptake. We found that an outbreak starting on 1 February or 1 March led to a lower health burden than an outbreak starting on 1 January because of increased booster coverage, particularly in older age groups. We also found that outbreaks starting later in the year led to worse health outcomes than an outbreak starting on 1 March. This is because waning immunity in older groups started to outweigh the increased protection from higher booster coverage in younger groups. For an outbreak starting on 1 February and with high booster uptake, the number of occupied hospital beds in the model peaked between 800 and 3,300 depending on assumed transmission rates. We conclude that combining an accelerated booster programme with public health measures to flatten the curve are key to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system.","output":"An assessment of the potential impact of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Aotearoa New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, little is known about the implications of this new virus on patients with underlying chronic comorbidities.

Yet the full extent to which the population has been in contact with either virus or vaccine remains elusive, particularly on a regional level, because (a) infection counts suffer from under-reporting, and (b) the overlap between the vaccinated and recovered subpopulations is unknown. Since previous infection, vaccination, or especially a combination of both reduce the risk of severe disease, a high share of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 immunity lowers the probability of severe outbreaks that could potentially overburden the public health system once again, given that emerging variants do not escape this reduction in susceptibility. Here, we estimate the share of immunologically naive individuals by age group for each of the 16 German federal states by integrating an infectious disease model based on weekly incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the national surveillance system and vaccine uptake, as well as assumptions regarding under-ascertainment. We estimate a median share of 7.0% of individuals in the German population have neither been in contact with vaccine nor any variant as of March 31, 2022 (quartile range [3.6%- 9.8%]). For the adult population at higher risk of severe disease, this figure is reduced to 3.5% [1.3%-5.5%] for ages 18-59 and 4.3% [2.7%-5.8%] for ages 60 and above. However, estimates vary between German states mostly due to heterogeneous vaccine uptake.

We compared the acute pulmonary response and lung deposition of surfactant by LISA and InSurE in surfactant-depleted adult rabbits. METHODS: Twenty-six spontaneously breathing surfactant-depleted adult rabbits (6C7 weeks old) with moderate RDS and managed with nasal continuous positive airway pressure were randomized to 3 groups: (1) 200 mg/kg of surfactant by InSurE; (2) 200 mg/kg of surfactant by LISA; (3) no surfactant treatment (Control). Gas exchange and lung mechanics were monitored for 180 min. After that, surfactant lung deposition and distribution were evaluated monitoring disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and surfactant protein C (SP-C), respectively. RESULTS: No signs of recovery were found in the untreated animals. After InSurE, oxygenation improved more rapidly compared to LISA. However, at 180 LISA and InSurE showed comparable outcomes in terms of gas exchange, ventilation parameters, and lung mechanics. Neither DSPC in the alveolar pool nor SP-C signal distributions in a frontal lung section were significantly different between InSurE and LISA groups. CONCLUSIONS: In an acute setting, LISA demonstrated efficacy and surfactant lung delivery similar to that of InSurE in surfactant-depleted adult rabbits. IMPACT: Although LISA technique is gaining popularity, there are still several questions to address. This is the first study comparing LISA and InSurE in terms of gas exchange, ventilation parameters, and lung mechanics as well as surfactant deposition and distribution. In our animal study, three hours post-treatment, LISA method seems to be as effective as InSurE and showed similar surfactant lung delivery. Our findings provide some clarifications on a fair comparison between LISA and InSurE techniques, particularly in terms of surfactant delivery.

This study's aim is to determine the gap between the vaccination willingness and uptake. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey among the persons aged 50-69 years in 13 communities in Shanghai in November-December 2020 to measure vaccination willingness, vaccine price sensitivity, vaccination service accessibility, and vaccine hesitancy. Then, we explored the factors influencing the vaccination uptake using a structural equation model. RESULTS Vaccination willingness was 70.5% (self-paid influenza vaccine), 79.4% (free PPV23 for local persons), 54.7% (self-paid PPV23 for non-local persons), and 16.6% (self-paid HZV); however, actual uptake was 10.8% (influenza vaccine), 11.0% (free PPV23), and 2.5% (self-paid PPV23). Moreover, vaccination uptake was strongly influenced by service accessibility ( = 0.941), followed by willingness ( = 0.201), price sensitivity ( = -0.188), and medical history of vaccine-preventable diseases and underlying diseases ( = 0.176).

Although numerous studies on SVA have been performed, comprehensive phosphoproteomics analysis of SVA infection is lacking. The present study performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics survey of SVA infection in Instituto Biologico-Rim Suino-2 (IBRS-2) cells. Three parallel experiments were performed, and 4,520 phosphosites were quantified on 2,084 proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses showed that many phosphorylated proteins were involved in apoptosis and spliceosome pathways, and subcellular structure localization analysis revealed that more than half were located in the nucleus. Motif analysis of proteins with differentially regulated phosphosites showed that proline, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were the most abundant residues in the serine motif, while proline and arginine were the most abundant in the threonine motif. Forty phosphosites on 27 proteins were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) phosphoproteomics, and 30 phosphosites in 21 proteins were verified. Nine proteins with significantly altered phosphosites were further discussed, and eight [SRRM2, CDK13, DDX20, DDX21, BAD, ELAVL1, PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), and STAT3] may play a role in SVA infection.

We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54C5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36C3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27C7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12C4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Recently, a diagnostic framework for these lesions has been established, and uniform diagnostic criteria have been recommended by the Amsterdam International Consensus Group. Chorioamnionitis is representative of the acute inflammatory lesion, and is the most frequent pathological diagnosis in placental pathology. The hallmark of chorioamnionitis is neutrophil infiltration in the membrane/chorioamnionic plate and fetal vessels. The inflammatory response can be both maternal (inflammation in the membrane or chorioamnionic plate) and fetal (inflammation in the fetal vessels-umbilical vessels or chorionic vessel). Recent studies have shown that the fetal inflammatory response is associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, chronic inflammatory lesions, such as villitis of unknown etiology and chronic histiocytic intervillositis, are also important. Although their etiology remains unknown, the maternal immune response against paternal antigens has been considered a possible factor.

Relative to diseased samples, apparently healthy portions of cMWS corals differed in immune activity and in the relative abundance of microbial taxa. Coral tissues with cMWS showed decreased tyrosinase-type catecholase and tyrosinase-type cresolase activity and increased laccase-type activity. Catecholase and cresolase activity were negatively correlated across all tissue types with microbiome richness. The localized effect of cMWS on coral microbiology and immunology is likely an important reason for the slow progression of the disease.

The issuing of this type of bond could provide an opportunity for commodity-producing African countries to hedge against fluctuations in their export earnings. The results show that the value of a commodity-linked bond increases as the price of the commodity indexed to the bond rises, suggesting that African countries should issue debt contracts that are tied to their export commodities so that their debt declines with plummeting export prices (or export revenues). A simple portfolio rule derived suggests that countries should issue more commodity-linked bonds than conventional debt if the variance of the portfolio is greater than twice the spread between the expected total return of the conventional debt and the commodity-linked bond. This rule supports the view that African countries' debt-service payments, for debt issued in the form of commodity-linked bonds, would decline whenever the price of their export commodities decline thus lightening their debt load.","output":"Commodity-linked bonds as an innovative financing instrument for African countries to build back better"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a cross-national comparative study of how media in Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa reconstructed their operations in response to Covid-19 global pandemic.

Informed by the sociology of news production theoretical lens, the study noted that journalists and editors were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic which ensured they change some journalistic practices. The findings of this study reveal that journalists suffered traumatic experiences such as job losses, covid-19 related illness and fatalities. At a regulatory level, findings confirm the perennial challenges with media freedoms in the region with South Africa remaining a lone outlier. Lastly, interviews with journalists further demonstrate that newsrooms have had to maximise digital affordances for news gathering and dissemination as old revenue streams dried up.

Hence, NHP recapitulate manifestations of disease not observed in other animal species. The Macaca fascicularis (i.e., Cynomolgus macaque) is an NHP species extensively used for biomedical research, but the TCR repertoire hasnt been characterized yet. Result We used the genomic sequences to design primers to identify the expressed TCR repertoire by single cell RNAseq. The data analysis from 22 unique samples were used to assign a functional status to each TCR genes. We identified and analyzed the TRA/D, TRB and TRG loci of the Cynomolgus macaque. Conclusion The genomic organization of the Cynomolgus macaque has great similarity with Macaca mulatta (i.e., Rhesus macaque) and they shared >90% sequence similarity with the human TCR repertoire.

METHODS This retrospective claims analysis included 6680 Medicare beneficiaries over age 66 with ovarian cancer who survived at least one year after diagnosis, had at least 4 outpatient evaluation and management visits and died between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index (COC) for each woman, and split COC into tertiles (high, medium, low). We compared late or no hospice use, >1 emergency department (ED) visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, >1 hospitalization, terminal hospitalization, chemotherapy, and invasive and/or life extending procedures among women with high or medium vs. low COC using multivariable adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS In this sample, 49.8% of women received aggressive care in the last month of life. Compared to women with low COC, women with high COC had 66% higher odds of chemotherapy (adjusted OR 1.66 CI 1.23-2.24) in the last two weeks of life. Women with high COC also had 16% greater odds of not enrolling in hospice compared to women with low COC (adjusted OR 1.16 CI 1.01-1.33). COC was not associated with late enrollment in hospice, hospital utilization, or aggressive procedures.

Clinicians use different therapeutic agents in the management of COVID-19 patients with arrhythmias, apart from ranolazine; however, some of these drugs are administered with caution because of their significant side effects. In this study, we reviewed the potential antiarrhythmic effects of ranolazine in the management of cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19. Ranolazine is a second-line drug approved for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Previous studies have shown that ranolazine produces its beneficial cardiac effects without any significant impact on the bodys hemodynamics; hence, blood pressure is not altered. Due to its reduced side effects, ranolazine may be more effective than other drugs in producing the desired relief from COVID-19 related arrhythmias, since it produces its antiarrhythmic effect by modulating sodium, potassium and calcium channels, and suppressing cytokine expression.","output":"COVID-19-related Arrhythmias and The Possible Effects of Ranolazine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of contracting disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. RESULTS: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). CONCLUSIONS: The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","output":"Estimating the burden of United States workers exposed to infection or disease: A key factor in containing risk of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A long-standing problem of observing Room Temperature Superconductivity is finally solved by a novel approach.

To be able to rapidly and safely immunize a large number of people against SARS-CoV-2, different mass vaccination options are available. Drive-through facilities have been successfully used in the past for immunization against other diseases and for testing during COVID-19. In this paper we introduce a drive-through vaccination simulation tool that can be used to enhance the planning, design, operation, and feasibility and effectiveness assessment of such facilities. The simulation tool is a hybrid model that integrates discrete event and agent-based modeling techniques.

GDM is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term offspring and maternal complications. For GDM screening and diagnosis, a two-step approach (1-hour 50 g glucose challenge test followed by 3-hour 100 g oral glucose tolerance test) has been widely used. After the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome study implemented a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in all pregnant women, a one-step approach was recommended as an option for the diagnosis of GDM after 2010. The one-step approach has more than doubled the incidence of GDM, but its clinical benefit in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes remains controversial. Long-term complications of mothers with GDM include type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, and complications of their offspring include childhood obesity and glucose intolerance. The diagnostic criteria of GDM should properly classify women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term complications.

The morbidity is increasing and poses a major public health concern, especially in resource-scarce regions. Therefore, a rapid, visual, sensitive, specific, cost-saving, and simple assay for N. gonorrhoeae detection is critical for prompt treatment and the prevention of further transmission. Here, for the first time, we report a novel assay called the multiple cross displacement amplification combined with gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (MCDA-LFB), which we constructed for the rapid and visual identification of N. gonorrhoeae in clinical samples. We successfully devised a set of MCDA primers based on the N. gonorrhoeae-specific gene, orf1. Optimal assay conditions were determined at 67C, including genomic DNA preparation (15 min), MCDA amplification (30 min), and LFB reading (2 min), which can be completed within 50 min. The limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was 20 copies/test (in a 25-l reaction mixture). Assay specificity was 100%, with no cross-reactions with other pathogens. Thus, our N. gonorrhoeae-MCDA-LFB is a rapid, specific, visual, cost-saving, and easy-to-use assay for N. gonorrhoeae diagnostics, and may have great potential for point-of-care (POC) testing in clinical settings, especially in resource-limited regions.","output":"A Nanoparticle-Based Biosensor Combined With Multiple Cross Displacement Amplification for the Rapid and Visual Diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Clinical Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several patient demographics such as race/ethnicity and comorbid chronic conditions are associated with severity of illness among COVID-19 patients.

Methods: The efficacy and safety of fibrinolysis were retrospectively analyzed in 7 patients with acute STEM, who hospitalized from February 29, 2020 to April 3, 2020 in the Department of Cardiology, Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. To optimize the fibrinolytic process on the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, a full-time medical team in charge of fibrinolysis under third-grade protection was established. The acute STEMI patients were treated immediately in a fixed and isolated area in emergency department before receiving green channel fibrinolysis. Blood samples for complete blood count, COVID-19 antibody test and nasopharyngeal swab samples for COVID-19 nucleic acid test were made before fibrinolysis, while the chest CT examination was accomplished after fibrinolysis. By comparing differences of time from the first electrocardiogram (ECG) to fibrinolysis before and after the improvement of fibrinolytic process, the effect of optimization of the fibrinolytic process was evaluated. Results: In the present study, seven patients with acute STEMI received fibrinolysis therapy, 6 of them achieved reperfusion and no bleeding was observed in all of the patients. Five out of the 7 patients were hospitalized after fibrinolysis, and the hospitalization days were 19.6 days on average. By following up to April 14, 2020, none of the 7 patients died. The first 2 patients were treated according to the routine medical procedure and the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis were 201 and 106 minutes, respectively. After the optimization of the fibrinolytic process, the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis of the last 5 patients were 42, 46, 51, 43 and 54 minutes, respectivelywhich was significantly shorter than that before optimization. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fibrinolysis in patients with acute STEMI is safe, effective and easy to implement. Therefore, it is recommended as the top priority for the patients with acute STEMI with indications for fibrinolysis. On the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, the duration of myocardial ischemia can be shortened by optimization of the fibrinolytic process.","output":"[Analysis on the efficacy and safety of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 epidemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to examine post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom levels and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic among treatment-seeking veterans with pre-existing PTSD.

This is a prospective study with a 12-week follow-up. Subjects were recruited from government general out-patient clinics, non-government organizations, and public housing estates in Hong Kong. Participants include 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living and 61 age- and sex-matched non-caregivers. A single-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was given to all subjects by intramuscular ingestion. Blood samples were collected before vaccination, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks after vaccination. Influenza vaccine strain-specific antibody titers were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition method. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed for ratios and absolute counts, and cytokine concentration were measured by flow cytometry. Validated scales were used to assess psychological (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and caregiver strain), social (multidimensional social support scale), and lifestyle factors (physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) at baseline prior to vaccination. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were also collected. Albumin levels were measured as an indicator for nutritional status in subjects. Caregivers had statistically significant (p < 0.05) lower cell-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination at 12 weeks when compared with those of the controls. No differences in humoral immune response to vaccination were observed between caregivers and controls. Hong Kong Chinese elderly who experience chronic stress have a significantly lower cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination when compared with non-caregivers.","output":"Chronic psychosocial stress: does it modulate immunity to the influenza vaccine in Hong Kong Chinese elderly caregivers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has dramatically challenged care for cancer patients, especially those with active treatment that represent a vulnerable population for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.

DESIGN: Exploratory qualitative design using an appreciative inquiry framework. SETTING: PIC unit; primary, secondary and tertiary. PARTICIPANTS: 46 nurses and doctors working on PIC. INTERVENTIONS: A set of images were used together with open-ended questions to prompt staff to discuss what wellbeing means to them. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Images depicting nature, children and groups of adults were selected most. Meanings of wellbeing for PIC staff can be understood through three themes: (1) Being nurtured and supported at work, (2) Importance of nature and (3) Social support independent of work. The first theme considered the importance of being listened to at work as well as staff highlighting the value of being in control at work. Within the second theme, being active in nature and outdoors as well as the importance of being in the present moment was illustrated. Within the final theme, staff expressed the value of having support independent of work and highlighted the importance of spending time with family. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a unique insight into how individuals working in PIC experience wellbeing and what wellbeing means to them. Understanding how healthcare professionals in PIC settings experience wellbeing and what wellbeing means to them will enable researchers to develop interventions designed to enhance staff wellbeing based on lived experience.","output":"Understanding what wellbeing means to medical and nursing staff working in paediatric intensive care: an exploratory qualitative study using appreciative inquiry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contexto: A COVID-19  uma doen?a viral que surgiu recentemente e associada  sndrome da angstia respiratria severa (SARS).

The aim of this study was to identify Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) biomarkers, to investigate their correlation with disease severity and to evaluate their usefulness for follow-up. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 were included in March 2020. Clinical and biological data were collected at admission, during hospitalization and one month after discharge. Patients were divided into two severity groups: non-ICU (28) and ICU and/or death (22) to stratify the risk. Results Blood parameters in COVID-19 patients at admission showed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (100%), ferritin (92%), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (80%), white blood cell (WBC) count (26%) with lymphopenia (52%) and eosinopenia (98%). There were significant differences in levels of CRP, ferritin, D-dimers, fibrinogen, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the two severity groups. Mapping of biomarker's kinetics distinguished early and late parameters. CRP, ferritin, LDH, lymphopenia and eosinopenia were present upon admission with a peak at the first week. Late biomarkers such as anemia, neutrophilia and elevated liver biomarkers appeared after one week with a peak at three weeks of hospitalization. Conclusions We confirmed that high-values of CRP, NLR, D-dimers, ferritin as well as lymphopenia and eosinopenia were consistently found and are good markers for risk stratification. Kinetics of these biomarkers correlate well with COVID-19 severity. Close monitoring of early and late biomarkers is crucial in the management of critical patients to avoid preventable deaths.","output":"A biological profile for diagnosis and outcome of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of ED patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection prevention and control precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95% CI 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (incident rate ratio 1.019; 95% confidence interval 1.017-1.021, P < 0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95% confidence interval 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of infection prevention and control requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.","output":"Epidemiology and clinical features of emergency department patients with suspected COVID-19: Results from the first month of the COVID-19 Emergency Department Quality Improvement Project (COVED-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging respiratory disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus and was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Methods A systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were queried in August 2021. Original articles reporting on air pollution exposure in CRS were included. Other forms of sinonasal disease were excluded. Results Literature search produced 11,983 articles, of which 10 met inclusion criteria. Outcomes evaluated included incidence/prevalence, disease severity, quality of life, and histopathologic/microbial changes. Air pollutant exposure was associated with higher odds of CRS, particularly with particulate matter (PM) exposure. Increasing air pollution exposure was also associated with worsened disease severity and detectable histopathologic changes. Impact on quality of life was less clear. Conclusion Air pollution (particularly PM) is correlated with CRS incidence/prevalence and disease severity, with evidence of histopathologic changes in CRS tissue samples.

RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We sequenced over 6,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from New Mexico (n=3091), Idaho (n=1538), Arkansas (n=1101), Wyoming (n=251), and Montana (n=33). We used this data to infer the transmission dynamics, identify variants, and map the spread of the virus. We identified a novel local variant that spread across New Mexico in early 2021, but was quickly replaced by the Alpha variant. In all RMCC states, the Delta variant overtook Alpha and has become nearly the only variant currently circulating in these states. We identified sequenced isolates from vaccine breakthrough cases in NM and demonstrate their role in onward transmission. We can identify shifts at a county or zip-code level in circulating lineages which may correspond to clinical outcomes or fluctuating case counts. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This integrated genomic data can be used by policy and decision makers within the New Mexico Department of Health and our RMCC partners to guide their public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 for New Mexico and the Mountain West"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a specific high-affinity angiotensin II-hydrolytic enzyme, is the vector that facilitates cellular entry of SARS-CoV-1 and the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2, which crossed species barriers to infect humans, is highly contagious and associated with high lethality due to multi-organ failure, mostly in older patients with other co-morbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating clinical evidence demonstrates that the intensity of the infection and its complications are more prominent in men. It has been postulated that potential functional modulation of ACE2 by estrogen may explain the sex difference in morbidity and mortality. We review here the evidence regarding the role of estrogenic hormones in ACE2 expression and regulation, with the intent of bringing to the forefront potential mechanisms that may explain sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes, assist in management of COVID-19, and uncover new therapeutic strategies.","output":"Is Sex a Determinant of COVID-19 Infection?

The aim of our analysis is to report the experience of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Pavia, including the learned lessons and future perspectives, considering that the COVID-19 outbreak is in its acute phase in other continents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center, retrospective, observational study based on extracted data from the medical records of all consecutive COVID-19 patients observed in our Vascular Department between March 1st and April 30th, 2020. We reviewed the records for demographic information, comorbidities, laboratory tests, and anticoagulation treatment at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: We observed an important reduction in elective and urgent interventions compared to the same period of the previous year; in parallel, we observed an increase in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients, especially with severe infection. In our department, four infections were reported among health workers. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID19 pandemic on health-care delivery has been massive. A wave of vascular-related complications is expected.

Nurses' disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses' motivation to participate in disaster events. By understanding these factors, the government and healthcare administrators can design disaster education plans and other strategies to improve Taiwanese nurses motivation to engage in disaster events.","output":"Relationships between disaster nursing competence, anticipatory disaster stress and motivation for disaster engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has impacted socio-economic activities in sub-Saharan Africa and Ghana for that matter.

METHODS: Clinical data of respiratory medicine patients treated in our hospital over the years were collected and 96 patients who met the requirements of the purpose of this study and the sample inclusion criteria were selected as the study subjects from the patients treated between April 2019 and January 2020. According to the care methods received by the patients in our hospital, 48 of them who implemented conventional care were used as the control group, and another 48 patients who were given quality care interventions were used as the observation group. The data were statistically recorded and comparatively analyzed for the indicators such as nursing oxygen index, heart rate, and clinical treatment efficiency of patients in both groups. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients in the observation group who received quality nursing intervention had more significant improvement in blood oxygen index and heart rate after nursing care; the clinical treatment efficiency of patients in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (95.83% vs. 81.25%). The data comparison between the groups showed a significant difference, P < 0.05, which was statistically significant.

Conceptual models of digital transformation are vital to universities and business schools to gain sustainability amid rapid technological changes. However, there is paucity of practical, implementable and simple digital transformational models combining technologies, system and educational phenomena.

METHODS: Samples of serum and saliva of 60 BNT162b2-vaccinated healthcare workers were collected at baseline, two weeks after the first dose and two weeks after the second dose. Anti-S1-protein IgG and IgA total antibodies titres and the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain in both serum and saliva were measured by quantitative and by competitive ELISA, respectively. FINDINGS: Complete vaccination cycle generates a high serum IgG antibody titre as a single dose in previously infected seropositive individuals. Serum IgA concentration reaches a plateau after a single dose in seropositive individuals and two vaccine doses in seronegative subjects. After the second dose IgA level was higher in seronegative than in seropositive subjects. In saliva, IgG level is almost two orders of magnitude lower than in serum, reaching the highest values after the second dose. IgA concentration remains low and increases significantly only in seropositive individuals after the second dose. Neutralizing antibody titres were much higher in serum than in saliva. INTERPRETATION: The mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination elicits a strong systemic immune response by drastically boosting neutralizing antibodies development in serum, but not in saliva, indicating that at least oral mucosal immunity is poorly activated by this vaccination protocol, thus failing in limiting virus acquisition upon its entry through this route.

The rate ratio for infectious keratitis after PRK was 5.68 during the COVID-19 pandemic (CI: 3.20 to 10.07, P < .001). The odds ratio for the ratio of cases of infectious keratitis after PRK to all cases of infectious keratitis was 9.00 during the COVID-19 pandemic (CI: 5.05 to 16.05, P < .001). To better understand the change in the rate of infectious keratitis after PRK during the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis was narrowed to the patients with infectious keratitis who had their procedure in Farabi Eye Hospital. Of the 8 patients who were diagnosed as having infectious keratitis after PRK, 4 were diagnosed in the pre-COVID-19 era and 4 were diagnosed in the COVID-19 era. The risk ratio of infectious keratitis after PRK was 9.11 in our department in the COVID-19 era (95% CI limit: 2.28 to 36.46, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infectious keratitis after PRK increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be due to the increased use of face masks in this era.

A key issue is distinguishing the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious disease, especially in children and teens. Methods: : To provide precise and comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 infected children, a total 62 hospitalized patients, aged from 1 to 14 years old and confirmed with the infection of either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus, were enrolled from September 2019 to February 2020. The epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as the outcomes of these pediatric patients were collected, followed by comparisons and regression analysis on clinical features and hematological parameters among the COVID-19 patients and the flu patients. Results: : We reported that SARS-CoV-2 infected children showed less fever (43.33% vs 100%, p<0.001) with mild elevation of the body temperature (p<0.001), as well as attenuated inflammatory responses in comparison with patients with influenza A infection. We further showed the significant correlations between initial body temperature and multiple immune parameters (white blood cell counts and inflammatory markers) among SARS-CoV-2 infected children. Conclusions: : Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have mild symptoms and relatively slow progression with a hypo-inflammatory response. Furthermore, the correlation results suggested that distinct immune responses were involved during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Differences on Pyrexia Related Immune Responses between SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-A-infected Children: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are inhabitants of the universe in this anomalous time due to the novel corona virus.

METHODS: This study included 2638 cases enrolled from 227 health care facilities that participated in the COVID-19 Registry Japan (COVIREGI-JP). The inclusion criteria for enrollment of a case in COVIREGI-JP are both (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and (2) inpatient treatment at a health care facility. RESULTS: The median age of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 40-71). More than half of the cases were male (58.9%, 1542/2619). Nearly 60% of the cases had close contact to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 7 days (IQR: 4-10). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15%, 396/2638) and diabetes without complications (14.2%, 374/2638). The number of non-severe cases (68.2%, n=1798) was twice the number of severe cases (31.8%, n=840) at admission. The respiratory support during hospitalization includes those who received no oxygen support (61.6%, 1623/2636), followed by those who received supplemental oxygen (29.9%, 788/2636), and IMV/ECMO (mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) (8.5%, 225/2636). Overall, 66.9% (1762/2634) of patients were discharged home, while 7.5% (197/2634) died.

Analyses were conducted on distinguished trabeculation which was divided into NC (maximum noncompacted/compacted ratio &#8805; 2.0) or hypertrabeculation (HT) (ratio < 2.0). We evaluated features of trabeculation and explored cardiovascular (CV) outcome events (coronary revascularization, hospitalization for worsening heart failure (HF), stroke, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and CV death). Over a mean of 4.2 years, CV outcome events occurred in 122 (41%) patients who were older and exhibited an increased frequency of diabetes mellitus, stroke, implantation of ICD, HF and dilated cardiomyopathy. The frequencies of NC or HT, the trabeculation ratio and its manifestation were similar among patients with and without events. NC/HT with concomitant apical hypocontractility and worsening systolic function were univariable predictors of adverse events. On multivariable analysis, concomitant apical hypocontractility on NC/HT remained significant (hazard ratio 8.94, 95% confidence interval 2.9-27.2, p < 0.001) together with old age, HF and increased E/e' ratio.

BACKGROUND: Nurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 unit nurses. DESIGN: Descriptive research study. METHODS: This study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID-19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative-pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non-COVID-19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID-19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID-19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among nurses working in COVID-19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up-to-date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources.","output":"Influence of anxiety and resilience on depression among hospital nurses: A comparison of nurses working with confirmed and suspected patients in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to provide reference for medicine-engineering interdisciplinary research.

In our effort the non-PDE4 inhibitor isocoumarins were transformed into the promising inhibitors via introducing an aminosulfonyl/aminocarboxamide moiety to the C-3 benzene ring attached to the isocoumarin framework. This new class of isocoumarins were synthesized via a PdCl2-catalyzed construction of the 4-allyl substituted 3-aryl isocoumarin ring starting from the appropriate 2-alkynyl benzamide derivative. Several compounds showed good inhibition of PDE4B in vitro and the SAR indicated superiority of aminosulfonamide moiety over aminocarboxamide in terms of PDE4B inhibition.

The participation of aminosulfonamide moiety in PDE4B inhibition and the reason for selectivity though moderate shown by 3q and 3u was revealed by the in silico docking studies. In view of potential usefulness of moderately selective PDE4B inhibitors the compound 3u (that showed PDE4 selectivity over other PDEs) was further evaluated in adjuvant induced arthritic rats.

The objective of the authors' study was to determine if sex and dental specialty were correlated with depression in dentists. METHODS The authors conducted a survey of a sample of dentists chosen randomly from the American Dental Association's mailing list of member dentists. The survey, stratified by sex and specialty, resulted in 560 responses, for a 53 percent response rate. The authors used the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale to measure depression. The authors examined the respondents' sex, age, number of children, marital status, specialty, practice type, location of practice, years in practice and hours worked per week. RESULTS The rate of depression in the overall sample was 9 percent. Sex was associated with depression (P < .001), but specialty was not. However, multiple regression analysis found that sex was significantly related to depression in only two specialties: periodontics and pediatric dentistry. Overall, the regression model explained an unimpressive 6 percent of the variance in depression scores. The most important finding of the study was that only 15 percent of depressed dentists were receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS The survey results showed that only female pediatric dentists and periodontists were more depressed than their male counterparts. None of the other variables studied contributed significantly to the understanding of depression in dentists. Depressed dentists, like other depressed people, tend not to seek treatment.

The induction of regulatory macrophages can be potentiated using the combination of anti-TNF and thiopurines, consistent with the enhanced efficacy of this combination therapy described in clinical trials. As thiopurines are unfortunately associated with significant side effects, we here aimed to identify alternatives for combination therapy with anti-TNF, using the macrophage induction model as a screening tool. Methods Mixed lymphocyte reactions were treated with anti-TNF and a library of 1600 drug compounds. Induction of CD14+CD206+ macrophages was analysed by flow cytometry. Positive hits were validated in vitro and in the T cell transfer model of colitis. Results Among the 98 compounds potentiating the induction of regulatory macrophages by anti-TNF were six benzimidazoles, including albendazole. Albendazole treatment in the presence of anti-TNF resulted in alterations in the tubulin skeleton and signalling though AMPK, which was required for the enhanced induction. Combination therapy also increased expression levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. In vivo, albendazole plus anti-TNF combination therapy was superior to monotherapy in a model of colitis, in terms of both induction of regulatory macrophages and improvement of clinical symptoms. Conclusions Albendazole enhances the induction of regulatory macrophages by anti-TNF and potentiates clinical efficacy in murine colitis.

It has saved several lives, reduced treatment costs and raised the quality of animal and human lives. Current traditional vaccines came empirically with either vague or completely no knowledge of how they modulate our immune system. Even at the face of potential vaccine design advance, immune-related concerns (as seen with specific vulnerable populations, cases of emerging/re-emerging infectious disease, pathogens with complex lifecycle and antigenic variability, need for personalized vaccinations, and concerns for vaccines' immunological safety -specifically vaccine likelihood to trigger non-antigen-specific responses that may cause autoimmunity and vaccine allergy) are being raised. And these concerns have driven immunologists toward research for a better approach to vaccine design that will consider these challenges. Currently, immunoinformatics has paved the way for a better understanding of some infectious disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, immune system response and computational vaccinology. The importance of this immunoinformatics in the study of infectious diseases is diverse in terms of computational approaches used, but is united by common qualities related to hostCpathogen relationship. Bioinformatics methods are also used to assign functions to uncharacterized genes which can be targeted as a candidate in vaccine design and can be a better approach toward the inclusion of women that are pregnant into vaccine trials and programs. The essence of this review is to give insight into the need to focus on novel computational, experimental and computation-driven experimental approaches for studying of hostCpathogen interactions and thus making a case for its use in vaccine development.","output":"Immunoinformatics and Vaccine Development: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider the problem of determining the mutational support and distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in the small-sample regime. The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites that may eventually mutate in the SARS-CoV-2 genome while mutational distribution refers to the distribution of point mutations in the viral genome across a population. The mutational support may be used to assess the virulence of the virus and guide primer selection for real-time RT-PCR testing. Estimating the distribution of mutations in the genome of different subpopulations while accounting for the unseen may also aid in discovering new variants. To estimate the mutational support in the small-sample regime, we use GISAID sequencing data and our state-of-the-art polynomial estimation techniques based on new weighted and regularized Chebyshev approximation methods. For distribution estimation, we adapt the well-known Good-Turing estimator. Our analysis reveals several findings: First, the mutational supports exhibit significant differences in the ORF6 and ORF7a regions (older vs younger patients), ORF1b and ORF10 regions (females vs males) and in almost all ORFs (Asia/Europe/North America). Second, even though the N region of SARS-CoV-2 has a predicted 10% mutational support, mutations fall outside of the primer regions recommended by the CDC.","output":"Small-sample estimation of the mutational support and distribution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention in high risk women. Most studies were European based demonstrating efficacy and safety with aspirin 150 mg, with studies in the United States supporting aspirin 81 mg for preeclampsia prevention. There is limited data from the United States evaluating aspirin 162 mg;the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of aspirin 162 mg vs 81 mg vs no aspirin for preeclampsia prevention. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study was performed at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) between 2013 and 2020. The no aspirin group was composed of women who met high risk criteria prior to October 2015, when aspirin was implemented at HFHS. The aspirin 81 mg and aspirin 162 mg groups were composed of women who met high risk criteria prophylaxed with the respective aspirin doses after October 2015. Exclusion was made for women with bleeding disorders, sensitivity to aspirin, and covid-19 infection (as applicable). Results: A total of 2,266 women met high risk criteria prior to October 2015 and received no treatment. A total of 944 women received aspirin 81 mg and 387 women received aspirin 162 mg. 322 women (14.2%) without treatment developed preeclampsia, compared to 134 women (14.2%) in the aspirin 81 mg group and 39 (10.1%) in the aspirin 162 mg group. The difference in preeclampsia rates between aspirin 81 mg and aspirin 162 mg was statistically significant (p = 0.043). The risks for postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum hematoma, and intraventricular hemorrhage of the newborn were not statistically different between women in the aspirin 162 mg group compared to the aspirin 81 mg group (p >0.05). Conclusion: We found a 29% reduction in the rate of preeclampsia for high risk women with aspirin 162 mg vs aspirin 81 mg without an increased risk for bleeding. Our study demonstrates that aspirin 162 mg should be recommended for preeclampsia prophylaxis in high risk women.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to utilize a large, nationally representative dataset of critically ill adults with COVID-19 to determine which factors explain mortality variability. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, we examined adults hospitalized in intensive care units with COVID-19 at 70 United States hospitals between March and June 2020. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined patient-level and hospital-level variables. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with interhospital variation. The median odds ratio (OR) was calculated to compare outcomes in higher- vs. lower-mortality hospitals. A gradient boosted machine algorithm was developed for individual-level mortality models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4,019 patients were included, 1537 (38%) of whom died by 28 days. Mortality varied considerably across hospitals (0-82%). After adjustment for patient- and hospital-level domains, interhospital variation was attenuated (OR decline from 2.06 [95% CI, 1.73-2.37] to 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00-1.38]), with the greatest changes occurring with adjustment for acute physiology, socioeconomic status, and strain. For individual patients, the relative contribution of each domain to mortality risk was: acute physiology (49%), demographics and comorbidities (20%), socioeconomic status (12%), strain (9%), hospital quality (8%), and treatments (3%). CONCLUSION: There is considerable interhospital variation in mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19, which is mostly explained by hospital-level socioeconomic status, strain, and acute physiologic differences. Individual mortality is driven mostly by patient-level factors.

However, despite that immunization coverage is increasing globally, many children in developing countries are still dropping out of vaccination. Thus, the present study aimed to identify determinants of vaccination dropouts among children aged 12C23 months in The Gambia. METHODS: The study utilized cross-sectional data obtained from the Gambia Demographic and Health Survey 2019C20 (GDHS). The percentage of children aged 12C23 months who dropped out from pentavalent and measles vaccination were calculated by (1) subtracting the third dose of pentavalent vaccine from the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine, and (2) subtracting the first dose of measles vaccine from the first dose Pentavalent vaccine. Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) were constructed to examine the risk factors of pentavalent and measles vaccinations dropout. RESULTS: Approximately 7.0% and 4.0% of the 1,302 children aged 12C23 months had dropped out of measles and pentavalent vaccination respectively. The multivariate analyses showed that when caregivers attended fewer than four antenatal care sessions, when children had no health card or whose card was lost, and resided in urban areas increased the odds of pentavalent dropout. On the other hand, when women gave birth in home and other places, when children had no health card, and being an urban areas dweller increased the odds of measles dropout.

Our study is a prospective study and aims to be familiar with the CT imaging features of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 44 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia between March 20, 2020 and May 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or recent travel history. All patients had no symptoms.

We studied an already-approved botanical drug cepharanthine (CEP) in a cell culture model of GX_P2V, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related virus. RNA-sequencing results showed the virus perturbed the expression of multiple genes including those associated with cellular stress responses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated heat shock response, of which heat shock response-related genes and pathways were at the core. CEP was potent to reverse most dysregulated genes and pathways in infected cells including ER stress/unfolded protein response and HSF1-mediated heat shock response. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomes also confirmed that genes of cellular stress responses and autophagy pathways were enriched in several peripheral blood mononuclear cells populations from COVID-19 patients. In summary, this study uncovered the transcriptome of a SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus infection model and anti-viral activities of CEP, providing evidence for CEP as a promising therapeutic option for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Transcriptome analysis of cepharanthine against a SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of open data and of tools to create visualizations on top of these open datasets have led to an ever-growing amount of geovisualizations on the Web.

Therefore, to investigate the early diagnostic value of (99m)Tc-Cys-Annexin V Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging were compared with MRI in rabbit models of steroid-induced femoral head necrosis. METHODS: The animal model of steroid-induced femoral head necrosis (SIFHN) was established in 5-month-old healthy New Zealand white rabbits by injecting horse serum into ear vein and methylprednisolone into gluteal muscle, the purpose of modeling is to simulate the actual clinical situation of SIFNH. (99m)Tc-Cys-Annexin V SPECT imaging and MRI were performed at 2nd week, 4th week, and 6th week after modeling. After that, histopathology was used to verify the success of modeling. Apoptosis was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). RESULTS: At 2 weeks after the injection of hormone, (99m)Tc-Cys-Annexin V SPECT image showed abnormal radioactive uptake in the bilateral femoral head. And over time, the radioactivity concentration was more obvious, and the ratio of T/NT (target tissue/non-target tissues, which is the ratio of femoral head and the ipsilateral femoral shaft) was gradually increased. In the (99m)Tc-Cys-Annexin V SPECT imaging at each time point, T/NT ratio of the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01); at 4 weeks after the injection of hormone, MRI showed an abnormal signal of osteonecrosis. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after hormone injection, apoptosis was observed by TUNEL and TEM.

However, the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal CMV status is inconclusive. This study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma CMV DNA status in black Zimbabweans. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 110 women in late gestation who included 36 CMV infected cases and 74 CMV uninfected, age and HIV status matched controls were enrolled. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against CMV were genotyped using Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol on the Agena MassARRAY? system. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE and the 'Genetics' and 'SNPassoc' packages of the statistical package R. RESULTS: The TLR7 rs179008A > T (p < 0.001) polymorphism was associated while the TLR9 rs352139T > C (p = 0.049) polymorphism was on the borderline for association with CMV positive (CMV+) status. In contrast, the interleukin (IL)-6 rs10499563T > C (p < 0.001) and TLR2 rs1816702C > T (p = 0.001) polymorphisms were associated with CMV negative (CMV-) status.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike transfected cells release a significant amount of exosomes loaded with microRNAs such as miR-148a and miR-590. microRNAs gets internalized by human microglia and suppress target gene expression of USP33 (Ubiquitin Specific peptidase 33) and downstream IRF9 levels. Cellular levels of USP33 regulate the turnover time of IRF9 via deubiquitylation.

COVID-19 vaccine adjuvants may be chosen among liposomes or other types of NM composed for example of graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, micelles, exosomes, membrane vesicles, polymers, or metallic NM, taking inspiration from cancer nano-vaccines, whose adjuvants may share some of their properties with those of viral vaccines. The mechanisms of action of nano-adjuvants are based on the facilitation by NM of targeting certain regions of immune interest such as the mucus, lymph nodes, and zones of infection or blood irrigation, the possible modulation of the type of attachment of the VAP to NM, in particular VAP positioning on the NM external surface to favor VAP presentation to antigen presenting cells (APC) or VAP encapsulation within NM to prevent VAP degradation, and the possibility to adjust the nature of the immune response by tuning the physico-chemical properties of NM such as their size, surface charge, or composition. The use of NM as adjuvants or the presence of nano-dimensions in COVID-19 vaccines does not only have the potential to improve the vaccine benefit/risk ratio, but also to reduce the dose of vaccine necessary to reach full efficacy.

Furthermore, the global phylodynamic expansion of MG is described, and the origin and extension of the outbreak caused by MG in Ecuador were tracked and characterized. The results obtained strongly supported the use of the mgc2 gene as a reliable phylogenetic marker and accurate estimator for the temporal and phylogeographic structure reconstruction of MG. The phylodynamic analysis denoted the failures in the current policies to control MG and highlighted the imperative need to implement more sensitive methodologies of diagnosis and more efficient vaccines. Framed in Ecuador, the present study provides the first piece of evidence of the circulation of virulent field MG strains in Ecuadorian commercial poultry. The findings derived from the current study provide novel and significant insights into the origin, diversification, and evolutionary process of MG globally.","output":"Unraveling the Global Phylodynamic and Phylogeographic Expansion of Mycoplasma gallisepticum: Understanding the Origin and Expansion of This Pathogen in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning models' goal is to make correct predictions for specific tasks by learning important properties and patterns from data. By doing so, there is a chance that the model learns properties that are unrelated to its primary task. Property Inference Attacks exploit this and aim to infer from a given model (\\\\ie the target model) properties about the training dataset seemingly unrelated to the model's primary goal. If the training data is sensitive, such an attack could lead to privacy leakage. This paper investigates the influence of the target model's complexity on the accuracy of this type of attack, focusing on convolutional neural network classifiers. We perform attacks on models that are trained on facial images to predict whether someone's mouth is open. Our attacks' goal is to infer whether the training dataset is balanced gender-wise. Our findings reveal that the risk of a privacy breach is present independently of the target model's complexity: for all studied architectures, the attack's accuracy is clearly over the baseline. We discuss the implication of the property inference on personal data in the light of Data Protection Regulations and Guidelines.","output":"Property Inference Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks: Influence and Implications of Target Model's Complexity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have been known to subvert the anti-apoptotic pathways of the host cell in order to delay apoptosis. However, the mechanisms utilized by enterovirus 71 (EV71) to mediate anti-apoptotic activity remained undetermined. We observed that EV71 infection induced an early activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. The activity of GSK3, a downstream target of these pathways, was negatively regulated by the activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3 could be inhibited by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Other Akt downstream targets, BAD, caspase-9 and the Forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), were not phosphorylated during the course of infection by EV71. We further demonstrated that infection by UV-irradiated, inactivated virus triggered early Akt activation but was insufficient to trigger late Akt activation. These data suggest that with the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt the subsequent inactivation of GSK3 is utilized by EV71 as a potential mechanism to delay host cell apoptosis.","output":"Phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK in an early entry step of enterovirus 71"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Children with COVID-19 may develop severe disease. In hospitalized adults, detection of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia ranges from 19% to 42% and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. A similar association in children remains unexplored. We determined the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in children hospitalized with COVID-19 and evaluated its potential association with severe disease. Methods. Single center prospective study that enrolled hospitalized children and adolescents 21 years old with COVID-19 from March 2020-April 2021 at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and blood samples were obtained and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified using a real time PCR assay targeting the N1 gene. Pertinent demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were evaluated. Results. We enrolled a convenience sample of 103 hospitalized children (median age, 9 years;range, 3 days-21 years) who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and both NP and blood samples obtained (Table 1). Overall, 27 (26%) patients with COVID-19 had SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Compared with patients who had undetectable RNAemia, those with SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia had significantly higher nasopharyngeal RNA loads (8.1 vs. 4.9 log10 copies/mL;p=0.0006), fever (78 vs 54%;p=0.02), receipt of supplemental oxygen (37% vs 14%;p=0.02), and treatment with anti-COVID-19 medications (30% vs 12%;p=0.04). In addition, patients with SARSCoV-2 RNAemia were more likely to require intensive care (40%% vs. 20%, p= 0.04) and had longer hospitalization (2.56 vs 2.15 days;p=0.03).

We have developed, what we believe is, the first automated interview grounded in multiple mini-interview (MMI) methodology. This study aimed to explore testCretest reliability, acceptability and usability of the system. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Multimethod feasibility study in Physician Associate programmes from two UK and one US university during 2019C2020. PRIMARY, SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Feasibility measures (testCretest reliability, acceptability and usability) were assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC), descriptive statistics, thematic and content analysis. METHODS: Volunteers took (T1), then repeated (T2), the automated MMI, with a 7-day interval (2) then completed an evaluation questionnaire. Admission staff participated in focus group discussions. RESULTS: Sixty-two students and seven admission staff participated; 34 students and 4 staff from UK and 28 students and 3 staff from US universities. Good-excellent testCretest reliability was observed at two sites (US and UK2) with T1 and T2 ICC between 0.65 and 0.81 (p<0.001) when assessed by individual total scores (range 80.6C119), station total scores 0.6C0.91, p<0.005 and individual site (0.79 p<0.001). Mean test re-test ICC across all three sites was 0.82 p<0.001 (95% CI 0.7 to 0.9). Admission staff reported potential to reduce resource costs and bias through a more objective screening tool for preselection or to replace some MMI stations in a hybrid model. Maintaining human interaction through touch points was considered essential. Users positively evaluated the system, stating it was intuitive with an accessible interface. Concepts chosen for dynamic probing needed to be appropriately tailored. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that the system is reliable, generating consistent scores for candidates and is acceptable to end users provided human touchpoints are maintained.

Understanding these associations would aid in the development of effective management strategies for these infections. AIM: To investigate whether clinical presentation and illness course differ between RTIs where a viral pathogen was detected and those where a potential bacterial pathogen was found. DESIGN AND SETTING: Post hoc analysis of data from a pragmatic randomised trial on the effects of oseltamivir in patients with flu-like illness in primary care (n = 3266) in 15 European countries. METHOD: Patient characteristics and their signs and symptoms of disease were registered at baseline. Nasopharyngeal (adults) or nasal and pharyngeal (children) swabs were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis. Patients were followed up until 28 days after inclusion. Regression models and KaplanCMeier curves were used to analyse the relationship between aetiology, clinical presentation at baseline, and course of disease including complications. RESULTS: Except for a less prominent congested nose (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.86) and acute cough (OR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.65) in patients with flu-like illness in whom a possible bacterial pathogen was isolated, there were no clear clinical differences in presentations between those with a possible bacterial aetiology compared with those with a viral aetiology. Also, course of disease and complications were not related to aetiology. CONCLUSION: Given current available microbiological tests and antimicrobial treatments, and outside pandemics such as COVID-19, microbiological testing in primary care patients with flu-like illness seems to have limited value.

METHODS: Twenty-one real top executives from twelve textile enterprises were recruited in the lab experiment, and decisions about whether entering an industrial zone under two conditions of following an industry leader or a common enterprise were designed as the experiment task. Throughout the formal experimental task, participants electroencephalograms were recorded. RESULTS: The behavioral results preliminarily proved the effect of industry leaders behaviors on the real top executives decisions in common enterprises: participants had a higher acceptance rate with a shorter reaction time in the condition of following an industry leader rather than that in the condition of following a common enterprise. Event-related potential results indicated that choices of following an industry leader led to a more positive perception of emotional valence (reflected by a smaller P2 amplitude) and better evaluation categorization and greater decision confidence (reflected by a larger late positive potential amplitude) than choices of following a common enterprise. CONCLUSION: Top executives from common enterprises tend to evaluate industry leaders behaviors better than other common enterprises behaviors, and they tend to make a similar business decision to keep their enterprises consistent with these industry leaders.","output":"The Influence of Industry Leaders Behavior on the Decisions of Common Enterprise Leaders in Enterprise Clustering: An Event-Related Potential Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of death. Every year, many people die due to heart attacks. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal plays a vital role in diagnosing CVDs. ECG signals provide us with information about the heartbeat. ECGs can detect cardiac arrhythmia. In this article, a novel deep-learning-based approach is proposed to classify ECG signals as normal and into sixteen arrhythmia classes. The ECG signal is preprocessed and converted into a 2D signal using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The time-frequency domain representation of the CWT is given to the deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) with an attention block to extract the spatial features vector (SFV). The attention block is proposed to capture global features. For dimensionality reduction in SFV, a novel clump of features (CoF) framework is proposed. The k-fold cross-validation is applied to obtain the reduced feature vector (RFV), and the RFV is given to the classifier to classify the arrhythmia class. The proposed framework achieves 99.84% accuracy with 100% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity.

The experience in France with regard to high government officials being charged with domestic crimes for the contaminated blood scandal during the AIDS epidemic is presented and analyzed noting the key legal rules expressed by the French courts in that context. This paper goes on in a comparative approach in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine such criminal liability in the US system with a discussion of the murky and complex issues of qualified immunity. It further highlights the efforts to have legislation passed to provide robust immunity for civil claims. And it posits that these immunities for civil claims likely reduce any likelihood of criminal process for acts and omissions of both public and private actors, except in the most egregious cases.Finding a likely impasse through these mechanisms, the article turns to international law and in particular customary international criminal law to see if it can provide a method of analyzing the human endangerment. Drawing from the Statute of the International Criminal Court as a possible crystallization of certain types of crimes against humanity, I identify particular groups against which such crimes might be seen as being in the process of being perpetrated.But, even if the particular crimes against humanity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court are seen as progressive development rather than crystallization, the article suggests that they are useful tools in helping to have an organize principle as to how to address the monstrous US response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The article ends with examples of how this method can help those concerned with human life to examine in a clear eyed manner the hundreds or thousands of intentional acts being done by public and private actors that endanger human life.

Methods: This 4-year retrospective study involved 613 at-risk patients who had either hematological disorders or other immunosuppressive conditions, notably solid organ transplants. Thirty-five patients had proven/probable aspergillosis and thirteen had chronic non-invasive aspergillosis. We compared PCR, galactomannan index and mycological analysis of BAL. Results: For invasive aspergillosis (IA), PCR performed in BAL yielded 88.6% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Comparatively, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded only 56.3 and 63.6% sensitivity and 97.6 and 94.5% specificity, respectively. Considering the 13 chronic aspergillosis cases, PCR, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded 76.9, 15.4, and 84.6% sensitivity and 92.2, 94.9, and 93% specificity, respectively. Fungal load in BAL evaluated by PCR was able to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination, but not between invasive and non-invasive forms. Finally, fungal load was predictive of 90-day mortality, with 23.1% mortality for patients with less than 500 copies/mL versus 68.4% for patients above that cut-off (p < 0.05).

Here, we report the first in vivo study of a novel AR system for the guidance of percutaneous interventional oncology procedures. METHODS: Eight patients with 15 liver tumors (0.7-3.0 cm, mean 1.56 + 0.55) underwent percutaneous thermal ablations using AR guidance (i.e., the Endosight system). Prior to the intervention, the patients were evaluated with US and CT. The targeted nodules were segmented and three-dimensionally (3D) reconstructed from CT images, and the probe trajectory to the target was defined. The procedures were guided solely by AR, with the position of the probe tip was subsequently confirmed by conventional imaging. The primary endpoints were the targeting accuracy, the system setup time, and targeting time (i.e., from the target visualization to the correct needle insertion). The technical success was also evaluated and validated by co-registration software. Upon completion, the operators were assessed for cybersickness or other symptoms related to the use of AR. RESULTS: Rapid system setup and procedural targeting times were noted (mean 14.3 min; 12.0-17.2 min; 4.3 min, 3.2-5.7 min, mean, respectively). The high targeting accuracy (3.4 mm; 2.6-4.2 mm, mean) was accompanied by technical success in all 15 lesions (i.e., the complete ablation of the tumor and 13/15 lesions with a >90% 5-mm periablational margin).

Study design and methods: A team of experienced acute and critical care nursing, medical practitioners, and education specialists, online and mobile learning specialists, and front-line workers were assembled. This team developed 10 online educational modules for rapid delivery and upskilling of registered nurses in Victoria, Australia. Nurses undertaking these modules were invited to complete a satisfaction survey. Survey questions were answered in Likert style or free text. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively, whilst freeform answers were explored for themes. Results: An online Critical Care Essentials course was launched in May 2020. In its first month 2,875 students had accessed this course. Course evaluation (n = 395 students) found over 92% responded favourably (Strongly Agree or Agree) to all 14 Likert style questions. Qualitative course feedback revealed four core themes: Applicability, accessibility, engagement, and endorsement.

This study evaluated the correlation between seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among HCWs and the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) & infection prevention and control (IPC). Methods: We prospectively recruited 1237 HCWs from nine public COVID-19-designated hospitals in Shiga Prefecture, central Japan, between 15C26 February 2021. All participants answered a self-administered questionnaire and provided blood samples to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: A total of 22 cases (178%) were seropositive among the 1237 study participants. Half of the participants (n=500;488%) had worked in red zones designated for COVID-19, where high exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in the past months. Seven (7/1025;068%) HCWs were suspected to have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. From these, binomial logistic regression from individual questionnaires and seropositivity predicted a significant correlation with N95 mask usage under aerosol conditions and work duration in a red zone. The institutional questionnaire suggested that IPC education was correlated with reduced seropositivity at hospitals. Interpretation: Seroprevalence and questionnaire analyses among HCWs indicated that secure implementation of PPE and re-education of IPC are essential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection within healthcare facilities. Occupational infections from SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings can be prevented by adhering to adequate measures and appropriate use of PPE.

Overall, among the HCoV-positive patients detected in this study, HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly detected virus, followed by HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E. The HCoV detection rates varied significantly with age (p = 0.00005), with the age group 0-14 years accounting for 28.6% (n = 30) of HCoV-positive patients. Fever and malaise were less frequent in HCoV patients than in influenza patients, while sore throat, dyspnoea, rhinorrhoea, and conjunctivitis were more associated with HCoV positivity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HCoV subtypes appear in ARI/ILI patients seen in general practice, with characteristic outbreak patterns primarily in winter. This study also identified symptoms associated with HCoVs in patients with ARI/ILI. Further studies with representative samples should be conducted to provide additional insights into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoVs.","output":"Epidemiology and Clinical Symptoms Related to Seasonal Coronavirus Identified in Patients with Acute Respiratory Infections Consulting in Primary Care over Six Influenza Seasons (2014-2020) in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) were rapidly developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is emerging evidence of adverse hematologic effects including thrombocytopenia, for recipients of both mRNA and adenovirus-vector vaccines. We report findings in 9 patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia following administration of an approved COVID-19 vaccine and managed according to the ASH COVID-19 Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) recommendations [https://www.hematology.org/covid-19/vaccine-induced-immune-thrombotic-thrombocytopenia]. Methods: The study population included adults >18 years of age presenting to a large Canadian tertiary care centre, between April 1 st, 2021 and May 31 st, 2021, with new-onset thrombocytopenia within 31 days of receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccines approved during this time period in Canada included BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, mRNA) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna, mRNA) vaccine, and ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca (AZ), adenovirus vector-based) vaccine. We report on the initial presentation, management and 90-day outcomes. Results : Among 9 patients with thrombocytopenia included in this cohort, the median age was 55 years (range 24 to 73), and 5 patients (56%) were female. Seven patients received AZ and 2 had Pfizer vaccines. All events occurred after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine with a median of 11 days between vaccination and presentation to hospital (range 2 to 31). All patients admitted to hospital tested negative for COVID-19 by PCR. Four patients developed TTS, as confirmed on both HIT ELISA and serotonin release assay, following AZ vaccination. Two patients presented with headaches and were diagnosed with cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT); and 2 presented with dyspnea and were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Platelet counts at presentation ranged 14-136 and D-dimer ranged 4000 to >44,000. HIT ELISA optical densities were persistently elevated. Three patients were admitted to hospital and received non-heparin parenteral anticoagulation, IVIG, and steroids. One patient had refractory thrombocytopenia with extension of CVT prompting use of therapeutic plasma exchange. Two patients had recurrent thrombocytopenia within 30 days of discharge and responded to repeat IVIG treatment. Five patients developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), four without associated thrombosis and one patient with history of ITP and splenectomy, maintained on Revolade, presented with ITP flare and deep vein thrombosis. Presenting complaints included petechial rash and minor bleeding such as epistaxis. Platelet counts ranged from undetectable to 67; D-dimer levels were normal in all at presentation. Four patients were admitted to hospital and received IVIG +/- steroids. Two patients had recurrent severe thrombocytopenia within 14 days of discharge, requiring repeat steroid pulse. See Table for summary of all patients. Conclusion: In summary, application of the ASH TTS guidance to patients presenting with thrombocytopenia, with and without thrombosis, following COVID-19 vaccination was instrumental in the early identification and successful management of these complications.

Spain has had one of the highest burdens of COVID-19 worldwide. During this period, Vall dHebron University Hospital Burn Center (Barcelona) has faced a unique challenge: supporting the hospital response against COVID whilst continued offering an optimal care to the burn patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute burn patients who received urgent health care or admission to the our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of burn patients who received urgent care and/or admission to our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain (Period 1: from March 14th to May 9th, 2020) and during the same period of the last year (Period 2: from March 14th to May 9th, 2019). Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients. RESULTS: A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0C16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period. A significant increase in the rate of burn children admitted and an increase in the severity of injuries in this population is noted. These data must be taken in account in the development of strategies to ensure the maintenance of Burn Centers function in extremely situations such as the current epidemic. A lack of effective burn prevention campaigns in our environment has been noted and the development of focused prevention strategies is a priority.","output":"Changes in the epidemiologic profile of burn patients during the lockdown in Catalonia (Spain): A warning call to strengthen prevention strategies in our community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of mathematics in several scientific disciplines is undisputed;work and everyday life take great advantage of its application.

As these are often improperly disposed of, they represent an important potential source of microplastics in the environment. We prepared microplastics from polypropylene medical masks and characterised their size, shape, organic chemical leaching, and acute toxicity to the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. The three layers of the masks were separately milled and characterised. Each of the inner frontal, middle filtering, and outer layers yielded different types of microplastics: fibres were obtained from the inner and outer layer, but irregular fragments from the middle layer. The shape of the obtained microplastics differed from the initial fibrous structure of the intact medical mask layers, which indicates that the material is deformed during cryo-milling. The chemical compositions of plastics-associated chemicals also varied between the different layers. Typically, the inner layer contained more chemicals related to antimicrobial function and flavouring. The other two layers also contained antioxidants and their degradation products, plasticisers, cross-linking agents, antistatic agents, lubricants, and non-ionic surfactants. An acute study with D. magna showed that these microplastics do not cause immobility but do physically interact with the daphnids. Further long-term studies with these microplastics are needed using a suite of test organisms. Indeed, studies with other polypropylene microplastics have shown numerous adverse effects on other organisms at concentrations that have already been reported in the environment. Further efforts should be made to investigate the environmental hazards of polypropylene microplastics from medical masks and how to handle this new source of environmental burden.

Design, setting, and participantsThis work involved analyzing wastewater samples collected weekly from 17 geographically resolved locations in Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky from February 10 to November 29, 2021. Genomic surveillance and RT-qPCR platforms were used as screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and state clinical surveillance was used for confirmation. Main resultsThe results demonstrate increased epidemiological value of combining community wastewater genomic surveillance and RT-qPCR with conventional case auditing methods. The spatial scale and temporal frequency of wastewater sampling provides promising sensitivity and specificity to be useful to gain public health screening insights about community emergence, seeding, and spread. ConclusionsBetter national surveillance systems are needed for future pathogens and variants, and wastewater-based genomic surveillance represents opportune coupling. This paper presents current evidence that complementary wastewater and clinical testing is enhanced cost-effectively when linked; making a strong case for a joint public health framework. The findings suggest significant potential for rapid progress to be made in extending this work to consider pathogens of interest as a whole within wastewater, which could be examined in either a targeted fashion as we currently do with SARS-CoV-2 or in terms of a global monitoring of all pathogens found, and developing evidence based public health practice to best support community health. Thumbnail BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSThe primary approach for the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 relies on the sequencing of clinical COVID-19 samples. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 can also be tracked in community wastewater. What this study adds?We propose that, for comprehensive community surveillance, the first line of community pathogen screening should involve geographically-resolved wastewater samples collected at a regular frequency and employ both Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and RT-qPCR. These results could then be compared with state clinical surveillance. This framework is a more comprehensive and cost-effective approach for surveillance in practice to catch community emergence, seeding, and spread. Policy implicationsOur results present a framework that could support the implementation of better surveillance policies directed to solve future community pathogen and variant detection. We anticipate this work can help public health officials implement rational community sampling schemes and develop sensible coordination with other clinical surveillance. The utility of this for COVID-19 extends to many other infectious disease models and other public health hazards such as toxic exposures.","output":"Combining community wastewater genomic surveillance with state clinical surveillance: A framework for SARS-CoV-2 public health practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To design and test a ventilator circuit that can be used for ventilation of two or more patients with a single ventilator, while allowing individualization of tidal volume, fractional concentration of oxygen, and positive end-expiratory pressure to each patient, irrespective of the other patients respiratory system mechanics. DESIGN: Description and proof of concept studies. SETTINGS: Respiratory therapy laboratory. SUBJECTS: Ventilation of mechanical test lungs. INTERVENTIONS: Following a previously advocated design, we used components readily available in our hospital to assemble two bag-in-a-box breathing circuits. Each patient circuit consisted of a flexible bag in a rigid container connected via one-way valve to a test lung, along with an inline positive end-expiratory pressure valve, connected to the ventilators expiratory limb. Compressed gas fills the bags during patient exhalation. During inspiration, gas from the ventilator, in pressure control mode, enters the containers and displaces gas from the bags to the test lungs. We varied tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, and positive end-expiratory pressure in one lung and observed the effect on the tidal volume of the other. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We were able to obtain different tidal volume, dynamic driving pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure in the two lungs under widely different compliances in both lungs. Complete obstruction, or disconnection at the circuit connection to one test lung, had minimal effect (< 5% on average) on the ventilation to the co-ventilated lung.

Chinese herbal medicine is incorporated into the Chinese national guideline for COVID-19 management, emphasising the individualisation of herbal treatment guided by pattern differentiation, which is an ICD-11-endorsed approach. However, this was not widely implemented with many provincial governments and hospitals developing their own guideline, suggesting the use of standardised herbal formulae and herbal active ingredients without pattern differentiation. Methods: Through the case study of COVID-19 guideline implementation, we compared the three approaches of developing Chinese herbal medicine, namely pattern differentiation-guided prescription, standardised herbal formulae, and herbal active ingredients, in terms of their strengths, limitations, and determinants of adoption. Results: Pattern differentiation-guided prescription is the practice style taught in the national syllabus among universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China, yet the lack of relevant diagnostic research reduces its reliability and hinders its implementation. Application of standardised herbal formulae is straightforward since the majority of clinical evidence on Chinese herbal medicine is generated using this approach. Nevertheless, it is downplayed by regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions where the use of pattern differentiation is required in routine practice. Although herbal active ingredients may have clear in vitro therapeutic mechanisms, this may not be translated into real world clinical effectiveness. Conclusions: Multiple COVID-19 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine prescribed using one of the three approaches described above are progressing. These results will demonstrate the comparative effectiveness among these approaches. Forthcoming clinical evidence from these trials should inform the updating process of the national guideline, such that its recognition and compliance may be strengthened.

During the first \\" lockdown\\" in 2020, we were keen on assessing the anxiety levels of patients who sought ophthalmic care despite the lockdown. Public health actions, such as social distancing, were necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As a result, most people felt isolated and lonely, thereby causing increased levels of stress and anxiety in them. We aimed to assess the anxiety levels using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and personality assessment using the 57-point Eysenck's Personality Inventory (EPI) questionnaire among patients visiting a tertiary eye care hospital during the lockdown period. Methods: Consecutive patients attending an ophthalmic tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown were approached to be a part of this prospective cross-sectional survey. Results: In total, 1,088 responses were analyzed during the 2-month study period with the mean age being 45.7 + 16.9 years. The majority had completed graduation (78%) with 15 years or more of formal education. The purpose of the visit was an emergency consultation in 42% (n = 455), a review appointment in 42% (n = 457), and the remaining (16%, n = 176) came for a routine consultation. The majority of the patients (>90%) did not report experiencing any of the 14 sets of symptoms. A mild level of anxiety was noted in 1,086 (>99%) respondents, whereas only 2 (<1%) respondents showed mild-moderate levels of anxiety. Financial concerns such as affordability of medications (6% vs. 3%, P = 0.05) and fear of losing their job (16% vs. 11%, P = 0.02) were significantly more in those experiencing any anxiety compared to those with no anxiety.

The Bayesian analysis suggests four traits to be of particular interest in predicting need for cognition: openness to experience, conscientiousness, honesty-humility, and emotionality. Further, we also find that need for cognition of software engineers is, on average, higher than in the general population, based on a comparison with prior studies.

Literature on long-term vestibular outcomes is scarce. Objective: This paper aims to evaluate vestibular dysfunction before and after cochlear implantation, the long-term vestibular outcomes, and follows up on previous findings of 35 consecutive adult cochlear implantations evaluated by a battery of vestibular tests. Methods: A prospective observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 35 CI recipients implanted between 2018 and 2019; last follow-up was conducted in 2021. At the CI work-up (T0) and two postoperative follow-ups (T1 and T2), 4 and 14 months following implantation, respectively, all patients had their vestibular function evaluated. Evaluation with a vestibular test battery, involving video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP), caloric irrigation test, and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), were performed at all evaluations. Results: vHIT testing showed that 3 of 35 ears had abnormal vHIT gain preoperatively, which increased insignificantly to 4 of 35 at the last follow-up (p = 0.651). The mean gain in implanted ears decreased insignificantly from 0.93 to 0.89 (p = 0.164) from T0 to T2. Preoperatively, 3 CI ears had correction saccades, which increased to 11 at T2 (p = 0.017). Mean unilateral weakness increased from 19 to 40% from T0 to T2 (p < 0.005), and the total number of patients with either hypofunctioning or areflexic semicircular canals increased significantly from 7 to 17 (p < 0.005). Twenty-nine percent of CI ears showed cVEMP responses at T0, which decreased to 14% (p = 0.148) at T2.

Detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics. METHODS: A unique database with detailed demographic characteristics, travel history, social relationships, and epidemiological timelines for 1,407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland China was reconstructed from 9,120 COVID-19 confirmed cases reported during January 15 - February 29, 2020. Statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions. Age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions. RESULTS: There were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders, with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households. Mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 5.0 (95% CrI: 4.4, 5.5) and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for household transmissions and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.6, 5.8) and 5.3 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for non-household transmissions, respectively. Hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years, whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people. CONCLUSIONS: Non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic.","output":"Reconstruction of Transmission Pairs for novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China: Estimation of Super-spreading Events, Serial Interval, and Hazard of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commercial polyethylene (PE) fiber-based masks are currently used as personal filters for protection against various microorganisms.

Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.","output":"Could natural products modulate early inflammatory responses, preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19-confirmed patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We sought to describe contemporary guidewire and microcatheter utilization for antegrade wire escalation (AWE) during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND Equipment utilization for AWE has been variable and evolving over time. METHODS We examined device utilization during 694 AWE attempts in 679 patients performed at 15 experienced US centers between May 2012 and April 2015. RESULTS Mean age was 65.6  9.7 years, and 85% of the patients were men. Successful wiring occurred in 436 AWE attempts (63%). Final technical and procedural success was 91% and 89%, respectively. The mean number of guidewire types used for AWE was 2.2  1.4. The most frequently used guidewire types were the Pilot 200 (Abbott Vascular, 56% of AWE procedures), Fielder XT (Asahi Intecc, 45%), and the Confianza Pro 12 (Asahi Intecc, 28%). The same guidewires were the ones that most commonly crossed the occlusion: Pilot 200 (36% of successful AWE crossings), Fielder XT (20%), and Confianza Pro 12 (11%). A microcatheter or over-the-wire balloon was used for 81% of AWE attempts; the Corsair microcatheter (Asahi Intecc) was the most commonly used (44%).

Methods: The participants (weighted n = 206, age 65-94) for the current study were selected from a nationally representative online survey of US adults from April 10-20, 2020. We used multiple linear regression to estimate the relative contribution of the four RAA global constructs (instrumental attitude, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy) in explaining intention to stay home after controlling for demographic covariates. We also conducted a content analysis to identify beliefs about advantages, disadvantages, and facilitators of staying home. Results: After controlling for demographic characteristics, injunctive norms (b = 0.208; SE = 0.059; B = 0.213, p < 0.01) and self-efficacy (b = 0.532; SE = 0.058; B = 0.537, p < 0.001) showed statistically significant independent associations with intention to stay home. The specific beliefs underlying the decision to stay home spanned across health and wellness dimensions and suggested interpersonal, mental health, and leisure/recreational facilitators. Conclusions: These findings suggest three public health intervention targets. First, self-efficacy building interventions could enhance older adults' perceptions of their ability to stay home to avoid unnecessary exposures. Second, health communication messages to address injunctive norms could emphasize that people important to older adults think they should stay home.

Viruses interfere with many cell functions, particularly critical pathways for cell death, by affecting various intracellular mediators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major example of these mediators because they are involved in many (if not most) cellular mechanisms. Virus-regulated miRNAs have been implicated in three cell death pathways, namely, apoptosis, autophagy, and anoikis. Several molecules (e.g., BECN1 and B cell lymphoma 2 [BCL2] family members) are involved in both apoptosis and autophagy, while activation of anoikis leads to cell death similar to apoptosis. These mechanistic similarities suggest that common regulators, including some miRNAs (e.g., miR-21 and miR-192), are involved in different cell death pathways. Because the balance between cell proliferation and cell death is pivotal to the homeostasis of the human body, miRNAs that regulate cell death pathways have drawn much attention from researchers. miR-21 is regulated by several viruses and can affect both apoptosis and anoikis via modulating various targets, such as PDCD4, PTEN, interleukin (IL)-12, Maspin, and Fas-L. miR-34 can be downregulated by viral infection and has different effects on apoptosis, depending on the type of virus and/or host cell. The present review summarizes the existing knowledge on virus-regulated miRNAs involved in the modulation of cell death pathways.

It is difficult to meet such unexpected demand with the present supply of vaccine doses, especially in developing countries like India. The existing literature has suggested prioritizing various groups such as medical fraternities, senior citizens, working professionals etc. Besides these, the pandemic has its own geospatial pattern. Prioritized vaccination drive as per this pattern could help in minimizing the risk of disease spread. However, identifying this pattern is a challenging task as it depends on multiple factors and also changes over time.Methods: In this work, we have developed an explainable prioritization (ExPrt) framework for this purpose. It collects publicly available data and prioritizes a subset of administrative regions in India using the density of population, confirmed, active, deceased cases, recent growth patterns, and vaccination ratio. The random wheel assists us here in prioritizing the regions based on the principle of wheel rotation in a bicycle race. It clusters severely affected regions and recommends appropriate priority at scheduled intervals. The explainability of the random wheel has additionally helped us in clarifying all priority recommendations individually. The framework presents the recommended priority and explanation using a user-friendly dashboard.Findings: In this paper, we have analysed the priority recommendations starting from February 1, 2021 to July 15, 2021. The ExPrt framework prioritized the regions with more than 70% of the caseload during May 2021 when India was struggling with the second wave of the pandemic. Interestingly, these regions constitute only 40% of the national population. A similar result is observed on other occasions as well. Prioritized vaccination drive in these regions could be possible even with a limited vaccine supply. Besides, the framework is capable of indicating severely affected but not sufficiently vaccinated regions. Although most of the severely affected regions in India are prioritized, there is a scope for further improvements.Interpretation: The ExPrt framework can provide necessary decision support for the efficient and informed distribution of vaccine doses across multiple administrative regions.Funding: None to declare.

Our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 preferred codons have poor representation of G or C nucleotides in the third position, a characteristic which could result in an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected cells with serious implications in host protein synthesis. By integrating this observation with proteomic data from infected cells, we observe a reduced translation rate of host proteins associated with highly expressed genes and that they share the codon usage bias of the virus. The functional analysis of these genes suggests that this mechanism of epistasis can contribute to understanding how this virus evades the immune response and the etiology of some deleterious collateral effect as a result of the viral replication.

One of the main challenges in treating GBM is related to the tumors location, complex and heterogeneous biology, and high invasiveness. To meet the demand for oxygen and nutrients, growing tumors induce new blood vessels growth. Antibodies directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis, have been developed to limit tumor growth. Bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, is the first approved angiogenesis inhibitor with therapeutic promise. However, it has limited efficacy, likely due to adaptive mutations in GBM, leading to overall survival compared to the standard of care in GBM patients. Molecular connections between angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress pathways, and the development of gliomas have been recognized. Improvement in treatment outcomes for patients with GBM requires a multifaceted approach due to the converging dysregulation of signaling pathways. While most GBM clinical trials focus on anti-angiogenic modalities, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. The selective therapeutic possibilities for targeting the tumor microenvironment, specifically angiogenic and inflammatory pathways expand. So, a combination of agents aiming to interfere with several mechanisms might be beneficial to improve outcomes.

Although the STEMI revascularisation time targets (<120min) are often difficult to achieve in normal times, they were almost impossible to achieve in periods of lockdown because of the many obstacles.

Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.","output":"Evolution of human respiratory virus epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has spread worldwide.

In 2019, Hispanic persons accounted for 18% of the U.S. population, but for 29% of new diagnoses of HIV infection (1). The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative aims to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030 (2). Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medication taken to prevent acquisition of HIV, is an effective strategy for preventing HIV infection.? To examine PrEP awareness and referral to providers among Hispanic persons, CDC analyzed 2019 National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation HIV testing data. Approximately one quarter (27%) of Hispanic persons tested for HIV at CDC-funded sites (n = 310,954) were aware of PrEP, and 22% of those who received a negative HIV test result and were eligible for referral (111,644) were referred to PrEP providers. PrEP awareness and referrals among Hispanic persons were lower compared with those among non-Hispanic White persons. Among Hispanic persons, significant differences were found in PrEP awareness and referrals by age, gender, race, population group, geographic region, and test setting. HIV testing programs can expand PrEP services for Hispanic persons by implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate strategies that routinize PrEP education and referral, collaborating with health care and other providers, and addressing social and structural barriers.","output":"HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Awareness and Referral to Providers Among Hispanic/Latino Persons - United States, 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading globally since December 2019, bringing with it anxieties, mortal risk, and agonizing psychological suffering. This study aimed to explore the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming (MD)an addictive mental behavior to vivid fantasy associated with distress and functional impairmentand forced COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and quarantine. Previous literature indicated that individuals employ MD for the regulation of distress and boredom, wish fulfillment, and entertainment experiences. The literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health identifies a flareup in psychological difficulties in the general population. In this study we explored the associations between the pandemic threat and mental health indices among individuals with MD. We surveyed 1,565 adults from over 70 countries who responded to calls for participants posted in online MD communities and other general social media sites. Probable MD was determined based on an empirically derived cut-off score on a pertinent measure. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, a series of MANCOVAs, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs, revealed that individuals with probable MD who were observing lockdown restrictions reported having spent more time in fantasy, experienced more intense and vivid daydreaming, and had a stronger urge to daydream than other participants. Similar statistical procedures indicated that, individuals with probable MD who reported pre-existing anxiety and depression disorders described a greater urge to daydream due to the pandemic and greater difficulty to control this addictive behavior. Compared to individuals with likely normal daydreaming, individuals with suspected MD reported more pandemic-attributed deterioration on a wide array of psychological distress indices. Our data show that the current worldwide pandemic threat is connected with an elevated intensity of this addictive form of mental activity, and that MD is associated with the exacerbation of psychological distress and dysfunction rather than with beneficial regulation of the experienced stressor.","output":"Heightened Levels of Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With COVID-19 Lockdown, Pre-existing Psychiatric Diagnoses, and Intensified Psychological Dysfunctions: A Multi-country Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive surgery including lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer is widely standardized for the management of endometrial cancer in recent decades. However, the learning curve for laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy is poorly reported, specifically that for the extraperitoneal approach. METHODS: We examined the learning curve for laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy by cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis by retrospectively analyzing 134 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who had undergone laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy, including the first case. Data on the surgical factors that improved and were statistically correlated with the number of procedures experienced were extracted and used to create CUSUM curves. RESULTS: The average time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy was 149.4 min to harvest an average of 65.3 para-aortic lymph nodes. Intra- and postoperative complications were observed in nine cases (6.7%). A switch to the transperitoneal approach was necessary in three cases (2.2%). The number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes and the procedure time were strongly correlated with the number of procedures the patient underwent (p < 0.01). The CUSUM curve of the number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes indicated an inflection point at the 51st case. The procedure time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy stabilized after the 59th case. CUSUM analysis of \\"unexpected events,\\" including intra- and postoperative complications and switch to the transperitoneal approach, showed an improved incidence at 60 cases and later. CONCLUSION: Gaining proficiency in laparoscopic extraperitoneal thorough para-aortic lymphadenectomy is associated with a long learning curve of over 60 procedures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT/PROBLEM: Respiratory distress was a main symptom of many patients. However, hospitals were unable to meet the demand for automatic proning beds at the beginning of the pandemic, and no literature on prone positioning for nonintubated patients was published. One clinical nurse specialist identified self-proning as a means to improve respiratory distress, subsequently disseminating education and applying the practice with nonintubated patients with respiratory distress in the emergency department and throughout the COVID units in 1 hospital. OUTCOME: Improved oxygenation saturation was observed by bedside staff after self-proning was implemented. Patients verbalized breathing easier while in the prone position. Patients were reminded to self-prone if their oxygenation saturations decreased. Self-proning afforded some patients enough stamina to call their loved ones before requiring intubation. CONCLUSION: Through this observational experience, it was apparent that this low-risk intervention of nonintubated self-prone positioning improved oxygenation in patients with respiratory distress with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"Self-proning in Nonintubated Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From recent developments on how roots affect soil organic carbon (SOC) an apparent paradox has emerged where roots drive SOC stabilization causing SOC accrual, but also SOC destabilization causing SOC loss.

We explored the health impacts during lockdown and following its conclusion. Methods A cohort of 898 working-age Australians enrolled in a national longitudinal cohort study, completing surveys prior to, during, and following a Victorian lockdown during the southern hemisphere winter and early spring 2020. Mixed linear regression models examined health outcomes during and following the lockdown. Generalised estimating equations assessed changes in several determinants of health such as social interactions, engagement in work and finances. Results The Victorian lockdown had negative consequences for mental health and increased levels of psychological distress. These health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and cessation of work. Following the conclusion of lockdown, outcomes assessing mental health, work and social interactions had recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified compared to pre-lockdown conditions. Conclusions Extended community lockdowns have adverse health consequences. Governments should weigh the potential health impacts of lockdown with the benefits of reducing COVID-19 transmission. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and financial support to maintain employment relationships. Longer-term follow-up is required to identify any persistent health effects of community lockdowns. Key messages Lockdowns result in adverse health consequences, and some quickly recover. Timely services and programs are encouraged to reduce negative impacts of lockdowns such as mental health supports and promoting safe interactions.

However, its terpene synthases (TPS), which act as metabolic gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, remain to be characterized. Auto-Headspace Solid-phase Microextraction/GC-MS analysis of floral volatile terpene constituents from seven sweet pea cultivars identified &#945;-bergamotene, linalool, (-)-&#945;-cubebene, geraniol, ?-caryophyllene and ?-sesquiphellandrene as the dominant compounds. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the transcriptome of Lathyrus odoratus flowers. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight TPS genes (acronymed as LoTPS) that were successfully cloned, heterologously expressed and functionally analyzed. LoTPS4 and LoTPS7, belonging to the TPS-b clade, biochemically catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. LoTPS3 and LoTPS8, placed in the TPS-a clade, also generated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, while LoTPS12 belonging to the TPS-g clade showed linalool/nerolidol synthase activity. Notably, biochemical assays of the recombinant LoTPS proteins revealed their catalytic promiscuity, and the enzymatic products were basically consistent with major volatile compounds released from sweet pea flowers. The data from our study lay the foundation for the chemical ecology, molecular genetics and biotechnological improvement of sweet pea and other legumes (Fabaceae).","output":"Functional Characterization of Terpene Synthases Accounting for the Volatilized-terpene Heterogeneity in Lathyrus odoratus Cultivar Flowers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Annually in the UK, 40,000C90,000 people are involved in a traumatic incident. Severity of injury and how well people recover from their injuries varies, with physiotherapy playing a key role in the rehabilitation process. Recovery is evaluated using multiple outcome measures for perceived levels of pain severity and quality of life. It is unclear however, what constitutes a successful recovery from injury throughout the course of recovery from the patient perspective, and whether this aligns with physiotherapists perspectives. METHODS: A qualitative study using two approaches: Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis following the Kreuger framework for focus groups. A purposive sample of 20 patients who have experienced musculoskeletal trauma within the past 4 weeks and 12 physiotherapists who manage this patient population will be recruited from a single trauma centre in the UK. Semi-structured interviews with patients at 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months following injury, and 2 focus groups with physiotherapists will be undertaken at one time point. Views and perceptions on the definition of recovery and what constitutes a successful recovery will be explored using both methods, with a focus on the lived experience and patient journey following musculoskeletal trauma, and how this changes through the process of recovery. Data from both the semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be analysed separately and then integrated and synthesised into key themes ensuring similarities and differences are identified. Strategies to ensure trustworthiness e.g., reflexivity will be employed. DISCUSSION: Recovery following musculoskeletal trauma is complex and understanding of the concept of successful recovery and how this changes over time following an injury is largely unknown. It is imperative to understand the patient perspective and whether these perceptions align with current views of physiotherapists. A greater understanding of recovery following musculoskeletal trauma has potential to change clinical care, optimise patient centred care and improve efficiency and clinical decision making during rehabilitation. This in turn can contribute to improved clinical effectiveness, patient outcome and patient satisfaction with potential service and economic cost savings.

We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection, and subsequently affects disease transmission by changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a central role in epidemic prevention;(b) a reasonable fraction of \\"over-reacting\\" nodes are needed in epidemic prevention;(c) R0 has different effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection;(d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic outbreak size.

To address this shortage, many have looked to the agility and accessibility of additive manufacturing (AM) systems to provide a democratized, decentralized solution to producing respirators with equivalent protection for last-resort measures. However, there are concerns about the viability and safety in deploying this localized download, print, and wear strategy due to a lack of commensurate quality assurance processes. Many open-source respirator designs for AM indicate that they do not provide N95-equivalent protection (filtering 95% of SARS-CoV-2 particles) because they have either not passed aerosol generation tests or not been tested. Few studies have quantified particle transmission through respirator designs outside of the filter medium. This is concerning because several polymer-based AM processes produce porous parts, and inherent process variation between printers and materials also threaten the integrity of tolerances and seals within the printed respirator assembly. No study has isolated these failure mechanisms specifically for respirators. The goal of this paper is to measure particle transmission through printed respirators of different designs, materials, and AM processes. The authors compare the performance of printed respirators to N95 respirators and cloth masks. Respirators in this study printed using desktop- and industrial-scale fused filament fabrication processes and industrial-scale powder bed fusion processes were not sufficiently reliable for widespread distribution and local production of N95-type respiratory protection. Even while assuming a perfect seal between the respirator and the users face, although a few respirators provided >90% efficiency at the 100?300 nm particle range, almost all printed respirators provided <60% filtration efficiency. Post-processing procedures including cleaning, sealing surfaces, and reinforcing the filter cap seal generally improved performance, but the printed respirators showed similar performance to various cloth masks. The authors further explore the process-driven aspects leading to low filtration efficiency. Although the design/printer/material combination dictates the AM respirator performance, the identified failure modes originate from system-level constraints and are therefore generalizable across multiple AM processes. Quantifying the limitations of AM in producing N95-type respiratory protective masks advances understanding of AM systems toward the development of better part and machine designs to meet the needs of reliable, functional, end-use parts.","output":"Additively manufactured respirators: quantifying particle transmission and identifying system-level challenges for improving filtration efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.7759/cureus.11701.].","output":"Correction: Bruton's Agammaglobulinemia and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Due to recent changes in the legal framework, access to fertility preservation (FP) for transgender individuals has opened up in several countries. In Sweden and the Nordic countries, fertility preservation for medical reasons is fully reimbursed as part of the established tax-funded healthcare services. As this issue is relatively new, procedures for FP have seldom been reported in the transgender patient population. The very limited literature has indicated that transgender women may have poorer sperm quality than cisgender men when assessing samples aimed at semen banking. OBJECTIVES To assess sperm quality parameters of semen samples provided for FP by transgender women before or after gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), and to compare sperm quality with a reference population of unscreened men defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, we aimed to describe referral patterns over calendar time and estimate time from referral to semen cryopreservation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective cohort study of 212 transgender women referred for FP to the Reproductive Medicine Clinic of Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, between 2013 and 2018. From 177 individuals that provided semen samples for cryopreservation, 16 had previously received GAHT. RESULTS Individuals with previous GAHT presented with significantly lower total sperm count than individuals without GAHT (p=0.002). However, higher proportions of sperm abnormalities were also noted among individuals who had not undergone previous GAHT, compared to the WHO reference population (p<0.001). Referrals of transgender women for FP increased over time. The median time from referral to semen cryopreservation was 27 days. CONCLUSIONS A high occurrence of sperm abnormalities was found in transgender women, especially among individuals who had previously received GAHT. The results underline the importance of thoroughly discussing parenthood options and FP with patients early after diagnosis and referring the patients for semen banking preferably before starting GAHT.","output":"Sperm quality in transgender women before or after gender affirming hormone therapy - A prospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surprise arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic produced an accelerated transition in all educational institutions, forcing them to take advantage of digital technologies and the Internet to ensure that their operation could keep going.

Assisted dying is the act of deliberately providing medical assistance to another person who wishes to end their own life. Currently, in Ireland, it is illegal to provide such assistance to people with WTD or suicidal ideation. However, a new bill that would legalise assisted dying for those with terminal illnesses, the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020, is due to be considered by lawmakers in Ireland in the coming months. In order to inform discussion around this complex issue, we examine the prevalence and longitudinal course of WTD in a large population-representative sample of older people. METHODS: To define WTD, participants were asked: In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead? Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. RESULTS: At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41C9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33C8.67)) were independently associated with WTD. Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2 years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (?44%) and loneliness (?19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up.

Time series analysis is of great importance to determine both the similarity in the behavior of COVID-19 in certain countries/states and the establishment of models that can analyze and predict the transmission process of this infectious disease. In this contribution, an analysis of the different states of the United States will be carried out to measure the similarity of COVID-19 time series, using dynamic time warping distance (DTW) as a distance metric. A parametric methodology is proposed to jointly analyze infected and deceased persons. This metric allows to compare time series that have a different time length, making it very appropriate for studying the United States, since the virus did not spread simultaneously in all the states/provinces. After a measure of the similarity between the time series of the states of United States was determined, a hierarchical cluster was created, which makes it possible to analyze the behavioral relationships of the pandemic between different states and to discover interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of COVID-19 in the United States. With the proposed methodology, nine different clusters were obtained, showing a different behavior in the eastern zone and western zone of the United States. Finally, to make a prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in the states, Logistic, Gompertz and SIR model was computed.

While ACE2 has been identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, the mechanism underlying cell entry remains unknown. Human immunodeficiency virus infects target cells via CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, CXCR4 interacts with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26/DPPIV), an enzyme that cleaves CXCL12/SDF-1, which is the chemokine that activates this receptor. By analogy, we hypothesized that ACE2 might also be capable of interactions with RAS-associated G-protein coupled receptors. Using resonance energy transfer and cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling assays, we found that human ACE2 interacts with RAS-related receptors, namely the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R), and the MAS1 oncogene receptor (MasR). Although these interactions led to various alterations of signal transduction, but, more importantly, ligand binding to AT(1)R resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 cell surface expression, while ligand binding to AT(2)R, but not to MasR, resulted in upregulation of ACE2 cell surface expression. Proximity ligation assays performed in situ revealed macromolecular complexes containing ACE2 and AT(1)R, AT(2)R or MasR in adult but not fetal mouse lung tissue.

We examine the seasonality of respiratory infections in England and Wales and the associations between weather parameters and seasonal coronavirus cases. Results: : The seasonal distribution of 985,524 respiratory infections in England and Wales (1989-2019) showed coronavirus infections had a similar seasonal distribution to influenza A and bocavirus, with a winter peak between weeks 2-8. Seasonal coronaviruses from 2012 to 2019 were compared to weather parameters for the 28-day average before the patients specimen date. Ninety percent of infections occurred where the daily mean ambient temperatures were below 10 o C;where daily average global radiation exceeded 500kJ/m 2 /hour;where sunshine was less than 5 hours per day;or where relative humidity was above 80%. Coronavirus infections were significantly more common where daily average global radiation was under 300 kJ/m 2 /hour (OR 4.3;CI 3.9-4.6;p<0.001);where average relative humidity was over 84% (OR 1.9;CI 3.9-4.6;p<0.001);where average air temperature was below 10 o C (OR 6.7;CI 6.1-7.3;p<0.001) or where sunshine was below 4 hours (OR 2.4;CI 2.2-2.6;p<0.001) when compared to the distribution of weather values for the same time period. Seasonal coronavirus infections in children under three years old were more frequent at the start of an annual epidemic than at the end, suggesting that the size of the susceptible child population may be important in the annual cycle. Conclusions: : The dynamics of seasonal coronaviruses reflect immunological, weather, social and travel drivers of infection. Evidence from studies on different coronaviruses suggest that low temperature and low radiation/sunlight favour survival. This implies a seasonal increase in SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the UK and countries with a similar climate as a result of an increase in the R 0 associated with reduced temperatures and solar radiation.

After the introduction of COVID vaccination, several reports were published, mostly after the mRNA vaccine. Until now, no causal link has been proven, so we need to have more reports in this sense to have a better knowledge of this phenomenon.

Currently there is no theoretical approach to the problem of containing misinformation outbreaks in temporal networks.

While M. tb has the ability to enter and survive in host macrophages, the precise mechanism of its internalization, and factors that control this essential process are poorly defined. We have previously demonstrated that perturbations in levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids in macrophages lead to significant reduction in the entry of Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis), a surrogate model for mycobacterial internalization, signifying a role for these plasma membrane lipids in interactions at the hostCpathogen interface. In this work, we investigated the role of the host actin cytoskeleton, a critical protein framework underlying the plasma membrane, in the entry of M. smegmatis into human macrophages. Our results show that cytochalasin D mediated destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton of host macrophages results in a dose-dependent reduction in the entry of mycobacteria. Notably, the internalization of Escherichia coli remained invariant upon actin destabilization of host cells, implying a specific involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in mycobacterial infection. By monitoring the F-actin content of macrophages utilizing a quantitative confocal microscopy-based technique, we observed a close correlation between the entry of mycobacteria into host macrophages with cellular F-actin content. Our results constitute the first quantitative analysis of the role of the actin cytoskeleton of human macrophages in the entry of mycobacteria, and highlight actin-mediated mycobacterial entry as a potential target for future anti-TB therapeutics.

Then, the knowledge of Z-numbers is used to derive the basic probability assignment of evidence and the synthetic rules in the DS theory are used to integrate evaluations.

The focus of this work is to accurately characterize the effect of COVID-19 on one of the UVA Internal Medicine, Primary Care clinics, and where possible, to refine and optimize patient flow through the appointment process while accommodating public health restrictions. To achieve these goals, the team adopted a systems approach, which involves the iterative process of problem identification, analysis, and testing recommendations. The first phase of the project focused primarily on establishment of the current state and problem identification. The appointment process contains six major elements: scheduling, sign-in/remote registration, check-in, rooming, check-out, and telemedicine. Through extensive discussions with the clients, surveys of clinic staff, in-person observation, and data collection and analysis, the capstone team was able to understand the pandemic's impact on the clinic's patient flow and identify key problem areas at each stage in the appointment process.

Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-, and IL-10, are the main mediators of CRS. Based on recent evidence, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II is known to be the target of the COVID-19 spike protein, which enables the virus to penetrate human cells. ACE II also possesses an anti-inflammatory role in many pathologies such as CVD (Cardiovascular Disease), HTN (Hypertension), DM (Diabetes Mellitus), and other conditions, which are the main risk factors of poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. Changes in tissue ACE II levels are associated with many diseases and hyperinflammatory states, and it is assumed that elevated levels of ACE II could aggravate the course of COVID-19 infection.

At a distance of 2 m, only particles of <5 m traversed between cages. Using this setup, we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission between the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and lineage A in Syrian hamsters. Aerosol transmission of both variants was confirmed in all sentinels after 24 h of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory virus shedding and seroconversion. Productive transmission also occurred after 1 h of exposure, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, after donors were infected with a mix of both variants, the Alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain. Overall, these data indicate that a lower infectious dose of the Alpha variant, compared to lineage A, could be sufficient for successful transmission. This highlights the continuous need to assess emerging variants and the development for pre-emptive transmission mitigation strategies.","output":"Increased small particle aerosol transmission of B.1.1.7 compared with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Herpes simplex virus (HSV) membrane fusion represents an attractive target for anti-HSV therapy. To investigate the structural basis of HSV membrane fusion and identify new targets for inhibition, we have investigated the different membranotropic domains of HSV-1 gH envelope glycoprotein. We observed that fusion peptides when added exogenously are able to inhibit viral fusion likely by intercalating with viral fusion peptides upon adopting functional structure in membranes. Interestingly, peptides analogous to the predicted HSV-1 gH loop region inhibited viral plaque formation more significantly. Their inhibitory effect appears to be a consequence of their ability to partition into membranes and aggregate within them. Circular dichroism spectra showed that peptides self-associate in aqueous and lipidic solutions, therefore the inhibition of viral entry may occur via peptides association with their counterpart on wild-type gH. The antiviral activity of HSV-1 peptides tested provides an attractive basis for the development of new fusion peptide inhibitors corresponding to regions outside the fusion protein heptad repeat regions.","output":"Peptides containing membrane-interacting motifs inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ureteral stone disease may be an emergent condition if the appropriate management is not performed in a timely manner. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, isolation and restriction orders taken by the governments have become the cores to control the pandemic. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the ureteral stone presentations in a high-volume university hospital during the COVID-19 restriction order period. Materials and Methods: The data of 149 patients who were hospitalized due to ureteral stone both during the COVID-19 pandemic restriction period and the corresponding period (non-COVID-19) of the previous year were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables. The categorical data were assessed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 149 patients, 35 were hospitalized in the COVID-19 restrictions period. While the mean age and the stone characteristics of the two groups did not differ significantly, serum creatinine levels (1.9  1.85 vs 1.15  0.64) and the white blood cell counts (12.45  6.54 vs 8.21  4.15) at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID-19 restrictions group (p = 0.034 and p = 0.005, respectively). According to the priority classification recommendations of the European Urology Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group for urolithiasis applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant difference was observed between the two periods (X2 = 9.907, p = 0.019). In particular, the rate of emergency cases was found more than threefold in the COVID-19 period. Although there was no significant difference in terms of the grade of hydronephrosis at hospital admission between the two groups, the rates of grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis were higher in the COVID-period group (1.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively).

Due to asymptomatic or mild courses of COVID-19, many infections remain undetected. Reported case fatality rates - COVID-19-associated deaths divided by number of detected infections - are therefore poor estimates of the IFR. Endogenous changes of the population at risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, changing test practices and an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 further exacerbate the estimation of the IFR. Here, we propose a strategy to estimate the IFR of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany that combines official data on reported cases and fatalities supplied by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) with data from seroepidemiological studies in two infection hotspots, the Austrian town Ischgl and the German municipality Gangelt, respectively. For this purpose, we use the law of total probability to derive an approximate formula for the IFR that is based on a set of assumptions regarding data quality and test specificity and sensitivity. The resulting estimate of the IFR in Germany of 0.83% (95% CI: [0.69%; 0.98%]) that is based on a combination of the RKI and Ischgl data is notably higher than the IFR estimate reported in the Gangelt study (0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]). It is closer to the consolidated estimate based on a meta-analysis (0.68% [0.53%; 0.82%]), where the difference can be explained by Germany's disadvantageous age structure. Virus mutations, vaccination strategies, and improved therapy will necessitate a re-estimation of the IFR. The proposed method is able to account for such developments.","output":"Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The AAMC prioritizes promoting a diverse and culturally competent workforce which is thought to have a positive impact on the health of people living in the US. There is a lack of diversity in the current landscape of academic medicine and strategies are needed to effect change. This module introduced undergraduate and graduate medical trainees to leadership skills and opportunities in curriculum innovation and reform by learning about and interacting with the office of medical education (OME) at their institutions. METHODS: We implemented a workshop using small-group case discussions and didactics to help medical students and residents learn how to: (1) describe the structure and functions of an OME, (2) describe leadership competencies associated with various roles within the OME, and (3) identify opportunities for trainees to engage with the OME on curricular innovation and reform, especially advancing diversity and inclusion. RESULTS: Across three sites, 45 learners completed partial or full workshop evaluations. Of learners, 22 (49%) were not knowledgeable and 13 (29%) were somewhat knowledgeable in identifying leadership opportunities for trainees to become engaged through the OME. There was a statistically significant increase in confidence after the workshop in discussing an interdisciplinary approach to the creation of a medical education innovation, and, assessing the need for curricula change. Over 90% of attendees agreed learning objectives were met.

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the \\"social distancing\\" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000a?m, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16a?km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83a?m and 3.05a?m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05a?m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5a?s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","output":"Influence of wind and relative humidity on the social distancing effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission: A numerical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is combined with the intelligent nursing information system to build the emergency nursing platform architecture, from the system emergency procedures, system functionality, network environment deployment, and database design aspects of the discussion.

METHODS: A convenience sampling method was used to administer questionnaires to 139 patients with endometriosis, using the Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAMA), the Depression Anxiety Scale (SDS), and the SF-12 Health Survey Short Form, and the results were analyzed. The SPSS20.0 software was used for statistical analysis on relevant data. If P < 0.05, there was statistical significance. RESULTS: Twelve-Item Short Form (SF-12) for health survey covered two comprehensive indexes, i.e., physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. MCS score was the main factor influencing anxiety and depression in patients with endometriosis; the higher the MCS score, the lower the anxiety and depression degrees in patients with endometriosis (OR = 0.912, 95% CI: 0.877C0.949; OR = 0.899, 95% CI: 0.866C0.933).

METHODS: Analyses included young adults with hazardous drinking (i.e., AUDIT-C score 3/4 for women/men; n = 50; ages 18C25) participating in a randomized trial in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants provided experience sampling reports on drinking twice per week from the week before SAH orders started on April 1, 2020 through 6 weeks during the SAH period. We examined how in-person contact with non-household friends changed over time and event-level relationships between alcohol consumption and in-person contacts. RESULTS: The percentage of participants with any in-person contact in the week before SAH was 44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30%C59%), which decreased to 29% (95% CI 15%C43%) in the first SAH week and increased to 65% (95% CI 46%C85%) by SAH week 6. Controlling for average levels of alcohol consumption, on days when young adults drank, participants reported more in-person contacts compared to nondrinking days.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between COVID-19 deaths and the county-level proportions of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic residents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study using COVID-19 mortality data from USA Facts linked to data from the US Census Bureau, the Health Resources & Services Administration Area Health Resources file, and the US Census Bureau. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the association between the total county COVID-19 deaths during consecutive 30-day intervals and the proportion of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic residents after adjusting for resident demographics, comorbidity burden, rurality, social determinants of health, and health care resources. RESULTS: In April, counties (n=179) with >40% Blacks had 6-fold higher death rates than counties (n=1521) with <2% Blacks [incident rate ratio (IRR)=6.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.29-13.2, P<0.001]. These counties had higher death rates until October, but were no different than referent counties in November. In April, death rates in counties with >40% Hispanic residents were similar to death rates in counties with <2% Hispanic residents. Death rates in these counties peaked in August (IRR=3.14, 95% CI: 1.69-5.82, P<0.001) but were also no different than referent counties in November. These effects were robust after adjusting for county-level characteristics.

Patients were stratified into two cohorts based on early-stage (cT1/2) versus locally-advanced (cT3/4) tumor at presentation. RESULTS We identified 589 patients who presented with early-stage tumors, and 39 patients with locally-advanced tumors. Of these, 73% of patients required adjuvant radiation, and 33% required adjuvant chemoradiation. There was no significant difference in the administration of adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation between the two cohorts. Patients in the locally-advanced disease cohort were significantly more likely to have Stage II/III disease by clinical and pathologic criteria by American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition criteria (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimates between the two cohorts (p = 0.75, 0.6, respectively), with estimated OS of 91% at 5 years, and estimated RFS of 86% at 5 years across the study population. CONCLUSIONS Up-front TORS offers favorable survival outcomes for appropriately selected locally-advanced cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Furthermore, up-front TORS is comparably effective in allowing avoidance of adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy, in both cT1/T2 and locally-advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. In the absence of clear technical contraindication to surgery, cT3/T4 classification should not be considered an absolute contraindication to surgery.","output":"Oncologic and survival outcomes for resectable locally-advanced HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer treated with transoral robotic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vaccines effectively prevent COVID-19, but some individuals have medical comorbidities or receive therapies that impair their immune response to vaccination, or are ineligible for vaccination. For such individuals who remain at risk of COVID-19, monoclonal antibodies may provide additional rapid protection. AZD7442 comprises 2 fully human extended half-life SARS-CoV-2Cneutralizing antibodies that bind distinct epitopes of the viral spike protein receptor binding domain. AZD7442 is in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report primary Phase 3 study results of AZD7442 for pre-exposure prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19. Methods PROVENT (NCT04625725) is a Phase 3, 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single 300-mg AZD7442 dose (2 intramuscular injections;150 mg each of tixagevimab and cilgavimab) for symptomatic COVID-19 prevention. Participants were unvaccinated adults ( 18 years old) without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, who may benefit from immunoprophylaxis with antibodies due to an increased risk of either inadequate response to vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The primary study endpoints were first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness post dose and prior to Day 183 (efficacy), and safety of AZD7442. Results In total, 5197 participants (mean age 53.5 years, 46% female) were randomized and dosed (safety analysis set): AZD7442 n=3460;placebo n=1737. In the primary efficacy analysis (full pre-exposure analysis set, n=5172), AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% (95% confidence interval 46.0, 90.0) vs placebo (P< 0.001) (Table). Adverse events occurred in 35% and 34% of participants administered AZD7442 and placebo, respectively, and injection site reactions occurred in 2.4% and 2.1% of participants, respectively (safety analysis set). There was 1 case of severe/critical COVID-19 and 2 COVID-19Crelated deaths in the placebo arm. Conclusion The primary study endpoints were met: a one-time dose of AZD7442 demonstrated statistically significant protection against symptomatic COVID-19 and was well tolerated. AZD7442 is the first long-acting monoclonal antibody combination that represents a potential new option to augment COVID-19 prevention. PROVENT funding statement image Disclosures Myron J.

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, na=a204), inpatients (cohort B, na=a81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohortaC, na=a23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6amol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","output":"Hypoferremia is Associated With Increased Hospitalization and Oxygen Demand in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we developed a flexible and transparent silver/polystyrene/polydimethylsiloxane (Ag/PS/PDMS) substrate with both high density of hot spots and satisfactory uniformity using a cost-effective approach.

In stark contrast to previous research on gender stereotyping and anger evaluations, however, results across four studies (N = 1,095) showed that both Black and White women portrayed as experiencing anger in the workplace were evaluated more favorably than White men doing so. After Study 1s initial failure to conceptually replicate, we investigated whether perceivers evaluations of womens workplace anger could have been affected by the contemporaneous cultural event of #MeToo. Supporting this possibility, we found evaluations were moderated by news engagement and beliefs that workplace opportunities are gendered.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study (March 3 to May 2, 2020). Patients were categorized according to the followed clinical management, as maximum care or limited therapeutic effort (LTE). Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Baseline factors associated with outcomes were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, estimating odds ratios (OR; 95%CI). RESULTS: Thirty-hundred and six patients were hospitalized, median age 65.0 years, 57.8% males, 53.3% Charlson index &#8805;3. The overall all-cause fatality rate was 15.0% (n = 46). Maximum care was provided in 238 (77.8%), IMV was used in 38 patients (16.0%), and 5.5% died. LTE was decided in 68 patients (22.2%), none received IMV and fatality was 48.5%. Independent risk factors of mortality under maximum care were lymphocytes <790/mm3, troponin T >15ng/L and hypotension. Advanced age, lymphocytes <790/mm3 and BNP >240pg/mL independently associated with IMV requirement.

Patients in rural areas may face reduced access to advanced treatments often only available at referral centers. We evaluated the association of referral center treatment with treatment patterns, outcomes, and geography in patients with ICC. METHODS: We queried the Oregon State Cancer Registry for ICC between 1997 and 2016, collecting clinicopathologic, demographic, and oncologic data. Patients were classified by treatment at a referral center or non-referral center. Crowfly distance to the nearest referral center (DRC) was calculated. Outcomes were evaluated using KaplanCMeier, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Over 20 years, 740 patients with ICC had a median age of 66 years. Slightly more than half (n = 424, 57%) were non-referral center treated and 316 (43%) were referral center treated. Referral center treatment increased over time (odds ratio [OR] 1.03/year, p < 0.05). Referral center-treated patients had improved overall survival in all patients (median 9 vs. 4 months, p < 0.001), in the non-metastatic group (median 13 vs. 6 months, p < 0.001), and in patients not receiving liver resection (median 6 vs. 3 months, p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, referral center-treated patients more often underwent chemotherapy, resection, or radiation (all p < 0.05). Increasing DRC (OR 0.98/20 km, p < 0.05) was independently associated with non-referral center treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with ICC who are evaluated at a referral center are more likely to receive treatments associated with better oncologic outcomes, including patients who are not managed with hepatic resection. Increasing the DRC is associated with treatment at a non-referral center; interventions to facilitate referral, such as telemedicine, may lead to improved outcomes for patients with ICC in rural states.","output":"Geographic Disparities in Referral Rates and Oncologic Outcomes of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: A Population-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article was to demonstrate the difference between a pandemic plans textual prescription and its effective processing using graphical notation Before creating a case study of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) of the Czech Republics pandemic plan, we conducted a systematic review of the process approach in pandemic planning and a document analysis of relevant public documents The authors emphasized the opacity of hundreds of pages of text records in an explanatory case study and demonstrated the effectiveness of the process approach in reengineering and improving the response to such a critical situation A potential extension to the automation and involvement of SMART technologies or process optimization through process mining techniques is presented as a future research topic","output":"Using a Process Approach to Pandemic Planning: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The technique of high-voltage electrical pulses (HVEP) is a new method to enhance the permeability of coal seams and improve the efficiency of coalbed methane (CBM) exploitation.

In this paper, an experimental system utilizing HVEP in water condition is established, coal samples with different strengths are crushed, and the extended processes of cracks are analyzed. According to the research results, the electrohydraulic effect has a good breakage on the coal; the number of main cracks is 2-3 and the length of the main cracks is about 30 cm in the vertical direction of the hard samples; and the formation of cracks is relevant to the discharge voltage, discharge times, and mechanical parameters of the samples. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrate that the cracks and pore connectivity of the coal samples are improved obviously, and the permeability results show that the permeability of crushed coal samples is 20% greater than that of the raw coal sample. Meanwhile, the generation process of cracks can be divided into four periods: namely, fatigue damage accumulation, slow development, rapid development, and failure; the rapid development stage is the optimal phase in field application. Moreover, the shock wave produced by HVEP via electrohydraulic effect can crush the samples mainly; furthermore, the energy produced by bubble rupture also has a great influence on the formation of cracks.

The objective of this study was to analyze public interest in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preventive measures and to identify variables associated with timely stay-at-home (SAH) orders issued by governors. METHODS: State-level search volume was collected from Google Trends. Average preventive measure interest was calculated for the query terms hand sanitizer, hand washing, social distancing, and COVID testing. We then calculated the delay in statewide SAH orders from March 1, 2020, to the date of issuance and by-state presidential voting percentage. Bivariate correlations were computed to assess the relationship between interest in preventive measures and SAH order delay. RESULTS: The correlation between average preventive measure interest and length of time before the SAH order was placed was ?0.47. Average preventive measure interest was also inversely related to voting for a Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 election (R = ?0.75), the latter of which was positively associated with longer delays in SAH orders (R = 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: States with greater public interest in COVID-19 preventive measures were inversely related to governor issuance of timely SAH orders.

There are limited available data about the experience of patients living with hATTR amyloidosis. This study used a qualitative, non-interventional design to explore the humanistic burden of hATTR amyloidosis from the patient's perspective. RESULTS: Fourteen adults with hATTR amyloidosis, recruited from a patient advocacy group or an academic clinical center, participated in individual semi-structured interviews either in person or by telephone. Patients were asked to describe their experiences living with the condition, including symptoms and disease-related impacts on functioning and well-being, work, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for key concepts using a grounded theory approach. Patients described many symptoms of hATTR amyloidosis, particularly those associated with peripheral neuropathy such as pain, numbness, weakness, and paresthesia. Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction, and symptoms related to cardiac dysfunction were also common. Worsening symptoms, especially those impacting patients' ability to walk or use their hands, often led to a loss of autonomy and an inability to work or perform ADLs. Disease-related disability also interfered with patients' participation in social activities, and contributed to feelings of fear, frustration, or sadness. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of hATTR amyloidosis were profound for the patients interviewed for this study. They described a sense of loss as their condition progressed and impacted them physically, emotionally, and socially.

DESIGN: Meta-epidemiological study. DATA SOURCES: National Institutes of Health Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines, a living review and network meta-analysis published in The BMJ, a living systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis in PLOS Medicine (The LIVING Project), and the Epistemonikos Living OVerview of Evidence (LOVE) evidence database. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES: RCTs in The BMJs living review that directly compared any of the three most frequently studied therapeutic interventions for covid-19 across all data sources (that is, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, or dexamethasone) for any safety and efficacy outcomes. Observational studies that evaluated the same interventions, comparisons, and outcomes that were reported in The BMJs living review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Safety and efficacy outcomes from observational studies were identified and treatment effects for dichotomous (odds ratios) or continuous (mean differences or ratios of means) outcomes were calculated and, when possible, meta-analyzed to match the treatment effects from individual RCTs or meta-analyses of RCTs reported in The BMJs living review with the same interventions, comparisons, and outcomes (that is, matched pairs). The analysis compared the distribution of study demographics and the agreement between treatment effects from matched pairs. Matched pairs were in agreement if both observational and RCT treatment effects were significantly increasing or decreasing (P<0.05) or if both treatment effects were not significant (P0.05). RESULTS: 17 new, independent meta-analyses of observational studies were conducted that compared hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, or dexamethasone with an active or placebo comparator for any safety or efficacy outcomes in covid-19 treatment. These studies were matched and compared with 17 meta-analyses of RCTs reported in The BMJs living review. 10 additional matched pairs with only one observational study and/or one RCT were identified. Across all 27 matched pairs, 22 had adequate reporting of demographical and clinical data for all individual studies. All 22 matched pairs had studies with overlapping distributions of sex, age, and disease severity. Overall, 21 (78%) of the 27 matched pairs had treatment effects that were in agreement. Among the 17 matched pairs consisting of meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of RCTs, 14 (82%) were in agreement; seven (70%) of the 10 matched pairs consisting of at least one observational study or one RCT were in agreement. The 18 matched pairs with treatment effects for dichotomous outcomes had a higher proportion of agreement (n=16, 89%) than did the nine matched pairs with treatment effects for continuous outcomes (n=5, 56%). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs evaluating treatments for covid-19 have summary treatment effects that are generally in agreement. Although our evaluation is limited to three covid-19 treatments, these findings suggest that meta-analyzed evidence from observational studies might complement, but should not replace, evidence collected from RCTs.","output":"Agreement of treatment effects from observational studies and randomized controlled trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, or dexamethasone for covid-19: meta-epidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have improved human life and significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of several human infectious diseases. However, these vaccines have faults, such as reactivity or suboptimal efficacy and expensive and time-consuming development and production. Additionally, despite the enormous efforts to develop vaccines against some infectious diseases, the traditional technologies have not been successful in achieving this. At the same time, the concerns about emerging and re-emerging diseases urge the need to develop technologies that can be rapidly applied to combat the new challenges. Within the last two decades, the research of vaccine technologies has taken several directions to achieve safe, efficient, and economic platforms or technologies for novel vaccines. This review will give a brief overview of the current state of the novel vaccine technologies, new vaccine candidates in clinical trial phases 1C3 (listed by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)), and vaccines based on the novel technologies which have already been commercially available (approved by EMA and FDA) with the special reference to pandemic COVID-19 vaccines.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused several organizations to be shut down and forced them to initiate work from home employing technology. Now more than ever, it's important for people and institutions to understand the impact of excessive use of mobile phone technology and electronic gadgets on human health, cognition, and behavior. It is important to understand their perspective and how individuals are coping with this challenge in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation is an effort to answer the research question: whether dependency on technology during lockdown has more effects on human health in comparison to normal times. METHODS: The study included participants from India (n = 122). A questionnaire was framed and the mode of conducting the survey chosen was online to maintain social distancing during the time of the Pandemic. The gathered data was statistically analysed employing RStudio and multiple regression techniques. RESULTS: The statistical analysis confirms that lockdown scenarios have led to an increase in the usage of mobile phone technology which has been confirmed by around 90% of participants. Moreover, 95% of the participants perceive an increased risk of developing certain health problems due to excessive usage of mobile phones and technology. It has been evaluated that participants under the age group 15C30 years are highly affected (45.9%) during lockdown due to excessive dependence on technology. And, amongst different professions, participants involved in online teaching-learning are the most affected (42.6%). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that dependency on technology during lockdown has more health effects as compared to normal times. So, it is suggested that as more waves of pandemics are being predicted, strategies should be planned to decrease the psychological and physiological effects of the overuse of technology during lockdown due to pandemics. As the lockdown situation unfolds, people and organization functioning styles should be rolled back to the limited dependency on technology.","output":"Effects of excessive use of mobile phone technology in India on human health during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within a year after its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 100 million people worldwide with a death toll over 2 million. Vaccination remains the best hope to ultimately put this pandemic to an end. Here, using Trimer-Tag technology, we produced both wild-type (WT) and furin site mutant (MT) S-Trimers for COVID-19 vaccine studies. Cryo-EM structures of the WT and MT S-Trimers, determined at 3.2 ? and 2.6 ? respectively, revealed that both antigens adopt a tightly closed conformation and their structures are essentially identical to that of the previously solved full-length WT S protein in detergent. The tightly closed conformation is stabilized by fatty acid and polysorbate 80 binding at the receptor binding domains (RBDs) and the N terminal domains (NTDs) respectively. Additionally, we identified an important pH switch in the WT S-Trimer that shows dramatic conformational change and accounts for its increased stability at lower pH. These results validate Trimer-Tag as a platform technology in production of metastable WT S-Trimer as a candidate for COVID-19 subunit vaccine.IMPORTANCEEffective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using Trimer-Tag technology, we are able to produce stable and large quantities of WT S-Trimer, a subunit vaccine candidate for COVID-19 with high safety and efficacy from animal and Phase 1 clinical trial studies. Cryo-EM structures of the S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate show that it predominately adopts tightly closed pre-fusion state, and resembles that of the native and full-length spike in detergent, confirming its structural integrity. WT S-Trimer is currently being evaluated in global Phase 2/3 clinical trial.

Older, overweight men, and those with type 2 diabetes, have lower testosterone concentrations, and poorer COVID-19-related outcomes. We analysed associations of premorbid serum testosterone concentrations, not confounded by effects of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, with COVID-19-related mortality risk in men. Design UK Biobank prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged 40-69 years. Methods Serum total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at baseline (2006-2010). Free testosterone values were calculated (cFT). Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths related to COVID-19 were ascertained from 16 March 2020-31 January 2021, and modelled using time-stratified Cox regression. Results In 159,964 men there were 5,558 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 438 COVID-19 deaths. Younger age, higher body mass index, non-white ethnicity, lower educational attainment, and socio-economic deprivation were associated with incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but total testosterone, SHBG, and cFT were not. Adjusting for potential confounders, higher total testosterone was associated with COVID-19-related mortality risk (overall trend P=0.008; hazard ratios, HR [95% confidence intervals] quintile 1, Q1 vs Q5 [reference]: 0.84 [0.65-1.12], Q2:Q5 0.82 [0.63-1.10], Q3:Q5 0.80 [0.66-1.00], Q4:Q5 0.82 [0.75-0.93]). Higher SHBG was also associated with COVID-19 mortality risk (P=0.008), but cFT was not (P=0.248). Conclusions Middle-aged to older men with the highest premorbid serum total testosterone and SHBG concentrations are at greater risk of COVID-19-related mortality.

However, few non-self-reported data sources are hitherto available. The present study aimed to assess changes in the online- and land-based gambling markets in Sweden during the first months affected by the societal impact of COVID-19. Methods: Data were derived from national authority data describing monthly taxations of all licensed Swedish gambling operators, whose monthly tax payments are directly based on gambling revenue. Subdivisions of the gambling market were followed monthly from before COVID-19 onset in Sweden (mainly February 2020) through June 2020, when the sports market was restarted after COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Overall revenue-based taxations in the licensed gambling decreased markedly from February to March, but stabilized onto an overall modest decrease through June. Commercial online casino/betting, despite some decrease in March, was maintained on a relatively stable level through June. However, within this category, horse betting increased steeply during the pandemic but returned to prepandemic levels later during the period. The state-owned operator in betting/online casino decreased markedly throughout the pandemic. The remaining commercial operators, mainly in online casino and online betting, demonstrated no change during the pandemic and ended on a June level 14% above the February level. Throughout the pandemic, the smaller restaurant casinos decreased markedly, while major state-owned casinos also closed entirely. State-owned lotteries and electronic gambling machines decreased markedly but were rapidly normalized to prepandemic levels. Conclusions: Commercial online gambling operators' revenues remained stable throughout the pandemic, despite the dramatic lockdown in sports. Thus, chance-based online games may have remained a strong actor in the gambling market despite the COVID-19 crisis, in line with previous self-report data. A sudden increase in horse betting during the sports lockdown and its decrease when sports reopened confirm the picture of possible COVID-19-related migration between gambling types, indicating a volatility with potential impact on gambling-related public health.","output":"Effects on Gambling Activity From Coronavirus Disease 2019An Analysis of Revenue-Based Taxation of Online- and Land-Based Gambling Operators During the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\\\","output":"The placenta in COVID\\\\19 infection in pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak in December 2019 in China, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) has rapidly spread and affected several countries.

Methods: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States/Union Territories (January to September 2020) from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Pangolin) lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. Results: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020, the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR/GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades, respectively, were noted to be indigenous evolutions.

We investigated the relationship between duration of mechanical ventilation prior to tracheostomy insertion and in-hospital mortality. In addition, we present a machine learning approach to facilitate decision-making. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Guys & St Thomas Hospital, London, United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring mechanical ventilation between March 3, 2020, and May 5, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline characteristics and temporal trends in markers of disease severity were prospectively recorded. Tracheostomy was performed for anticipated prolonged ventilatory wean when levels of respiratory support were favorable. Decision tree was constructed using C4.5 algorithm, and its classification performance has been evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-six patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, of which 87 patients (49.4%) underwent tracheostomy. We identified that optimal timing for tracheostomy insertion is between day 13 and day 17. Presence of fibrosis on CT scan (odds ratio, 13.26; 95% CI [3.61C48.91]; p  0.0001) and Pao(2):Fio(2) ratio (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.95C0.99]; p = 0.008) were independently associated with tracheostomy insertion. Cox multiple regression analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio, 6.56; 95% CI [1.04C41.59]; p = 0.046), ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI [1.19C17.87]; p = 0.027), positive end-expiratory pressure (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI [1.02C1.57]; p = 0.034), Pao(2):Fio(2) ratio (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.97C0.99]; p = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI [1C1.01]; p = 0.005) were independent late predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Such data are very important for the analysis of molecular mechanisms of disease progression and development of new strategies for the treatment of various diseases and pathological conditions. The texts of publications represent a primary source of information, which is especially important to collect the data of the highest quality due to the immediate obtaining information, in comparison with databases. In our study, we aimed at the development and testing of an approach to the named entity recognition in the abstracts of publications. More specifically, we have developed and tested an algorithm based on the conditional random fields, which provides recognition of NEs of (i) genes and proteins and (ii) chemicals. Careful selection of abstracts strictly related to the subject of interest leads to the possibility of extracting the NEs strongly associated with the subject. To test the applicability of our approach, we have applied it for the extraction of (i) potential HIV inhibitors and (ii) a set of proteins and genes potentially responsible for viremic control in HIV-positive patients. The computational experiments performed provide the estimations of evaluating the accuracy of recognition of chemical NEs and proteins (genes). The precision of the chemical NEs recognition is over 0.91; recall is 0.86, and the F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) is 0.89; the precision of recognition of proteins and genes names is over 0.86; recall is 0.83; while F1-score is above 0.85. Evaluation of the algorithm on two case studies related to HIV treatment confirms our suggestion about the possibility of extracting the NEs strongly relevant to (i) HIV inhibitors and (ii) a group of patients i.e., the group of HIV-positive individuals with an ability to maintain an undetectable HIV-1 viral load overtime in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Analysis of the results obtained provides insights into the function of proteins that can be responsible for viremic control.

METHODS: A content analysis of MPH programs in Canada was conducted from July 2019 to November 2019. A sampling frame of programs was obtained from a list from the PHAC Web site. Program information, including mandatory and elective course descriptions, was extracted from each program's Web site and analyzed in NVivo 12. Course descriptions were independently categorized by 2 researchers into 1 or more of the 7 categories of the core competencies outlined by the PHAC. RESULTS: We identified 18 universities with MPH programs with 267 courses across Canada. Thematic analysis revealed that 100% of programs had coursework that addressed the Public Health Sciences and Assessment and Analysis categories; 93% addressed Policy and Program Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation; 67% addressed each of Communication, Leadership, and Partnerships, Collaboration, and Advocacy; and only 56% had course descriptions addressing Diversity and Inclusiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We find that Canadian MPH programs may lack course offerings addressing core competency categories relating to diversity and inclusiveness, communication, and leadership.

The Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) has shown that primary Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PjP) prophylaxis can be safely withdrawn in patients with CD4 counts of 100 to 200 cells/L if plasma HIV-RNA is suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy. Whether this holds true for secondary prophylaxis is not known, and this has proved difficult to determine due to the much lower population at risk. METHODS We estimated the incidence of secondary PjP by including patient data collected from 1998 to 2015 from the COHERE cohort collaboration according to time-updated CD4 counts, HIV-RNA and use of PjP prophylaxis in persons >16 years of age. We fitted a Poisson generalized additive model in which the smoothed effect of CD4 was modelled by a restricted cubic spline, and HIV-RNA was stratified as low (<400), medium (400 to 10,000) or high (>10,000copies/mL). RESULTS There were 373 recurrences of PjP during 74,295 person-years (py) in 10,476 patients. The PjP incidence in the different plasma HIV-RNA strata differed significantly and was lowest in the low stratum. For patients off prophylaxis with CD4 counts between 100 and 200 cells/L and HIV-RNA below 400 copies/mL, the incidence of recurrent PjP was 3.9 (95% CI: 2.0 to 5.8) per 1000 py, not significantly different from patients on prophylaxis in the same stratum (1.9, 95% CI: 0.1 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS HIV viraemia importantly affects the risk of recurrent PjP. In virologically suppressed patients on ART with CD4 counts of 100 to 200/L, the incidence of PjP off prophylaxis is below 10/1000 py. Secondary PjP prophylaxis may be safely withheld in such patients. While European guidelines recommend discontinuing secondary PjP prophylaxis only if CD4 counts rise above 200 cells/mL, the latest US Guidelines consider secondary prophylaxis discontinuation even in patients with a CD4 count above 100 cells/L and suppressed viral load. Our results strengthen and support this US recommendation.","output":"No need for secondary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in adult people living with HIV from Europe on ART with suppressed viraemia and a CD4 cell count greater than 100 cells/L."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid advances in machine learning and related techniques have increased optimism about self-driving cars, autonomous surgery, and other uses of artificial intelligence (AI).

Moreover, those that used ridesharing apps prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly more supportive of autonomous vehicles. We also find that self-reported familiarity with AI is correlated with increased approval of AI uses in a variety of areas, including facial recognition, natural disaster impact planning, and even military surveillance. Related, those who expressed greater opposition to AI adoption also appear more concerned about trade-offs between privacy and information and bias in algorithms.

No FDA approved vaccine or antiviral is available for the treatment of this infection. Zhavoronkov et al., with their generative chemistry pipeline have generated structures that can be potential novel drug-like inhibitors for COVID-19, provided they are validated. 3C-like protease (3CLP) is a homodimeric cysteine protease that is present in coronaviruses. Interestingly, 3CLP is 96.1% structurally similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate interaction of generated structures with 3CLP of SARS-CoV (RCSB PDB ID: 4MDS). METHOD: Crystal structure of human SARS-CoV with a non-covalent inhibitor with resolution: 1.598 ? was obtained and molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interaction with generated structures. The MM-GBSA and IFD-SP were performed to narrow down to the structures with better binding energy and IFD score. The ADME analysis was performed on top 5 hits and further MD simulation was employed for top 2 hits. RESULTS: In XP docking, IFD-SP and molecular dynamic simulation studies, the top 2 hits 32 and 61 showed interaction with key amino acid residue GLU166. The structure 61, also showed interaction with HIS164. These interactions of generated structure 32 and 61, with GLU166 and HIS164 indicates the binding of selected drug within the close proximity of 3CLP. In the MD simulation the protein-ligand complex of 61 and 4MDS was found to be more stable for 10ns.

Its outbreak has caused a huge burden on healthcare systems all over the world. Several studies in the medical literature have suggested that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for developing severe symptoms, poor prognosis, and high mortality rates. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors among COVID-19 patients based on the Framingham risk score (FRS), and to evaluate the association of CVD risk factors with clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we identified 264 confirmed cases with COVID-19 at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients aged 18-80 years were included, and their electronic records were reviewed. They were classified into low, intermediate, and high risk of CVD according to FRS classification. Results: Two-hundred-six patients (67% male) were included in this study. The mean age was 55.3  15.1 years. Most patients had comorbidities: the most common were hypertension (48.1%), diabetes (45.1%), and ischemic heart disease (11.2%). More than half required intensive care admission, and 58 (28.2%) patients died. Pneumonia was the most frequently observed complication (85%), followed by mechanical ventilation (28.3%) and acute kidney injury (27.7%). Age, male gender, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus showed significant differences between FRS categories, and were associated with intermediate and high-risk groups of FRS (p < 0.05). Pneumonia and length of stay were associated with the Intermediate risk group of FRS. Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease risk factors are prevalent in Saudi patients infected with COVID-19.

Despite evidence to suggest this can safely be performed in an outpatient setting, inpatient care remains standard practice in Australia potentially due to a variety of factors (van Dijk et al. 2018; Cirocchi et al. 2019). Hospital in the home (HIH) allows patients requiring complex care including intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids and complex pain relief to be managed at home. This study examined the safety and efficacy of HIH-based care for acute diverticulitis over a 16-year period. METHODOLOGY A retrospective review of cases of acute diverticulitis managed under our HIH service from the period of 1st of January 2004 to 20th of October 2020 was completed. Baseline descriptive data relating to age, co-morbidities and severity of diverticulitis was collected. Details of medical treatment provided and subsequent complications were also collected. RESULTS During the study period, 23 patients with acute diverticulitis were treated under the HIH unit. Among the study population, the median age was 60 (interquartile range 15) with a slight female predominance (n = 13, 56.5%). This represented the first presentation in 60.9% of patients. Average length of stay was 3.6 days (SD = 1.0) with no acute complications recorded in the study period. Two patients (8.7%) had further episodes of acute diverticulitis within 60 days.

Two hundred and thirty-five participated in the study (66% response rate), representing more than half of all neurosurgical residents in the country. RESULTS: Assignment to direct COVID-19 medical care was common (85.5%). Many of the neurosurgery residents (37.9%) were tested positive for COVID-19. Almost half of the respondents reported a decrease in work hours. Most participants (84.3%) reported a decline in total operative case volume (mean change, -29.1%  1.6%), largely as a result of a decrease in elective (-33.2%  1.6%) as opposed to emergency cases (-5.1%  1.8%). For theoretic education, most respondents (54.9%) indicated a negative impact, whereas 25.1% reported a positive impact. For practical training, most respondents (78.7%) reported an adverse effect. A decrease in elective surgical case volume predicted a positive impact on theoretic training but a negative impact on practical training. Research productivity was reported by 33.2% to have decreased and by 23% to have increased. Forty-two percent indicated an increase in concerns about their training and career, with a negative impact on practical training being the most important predictor.

Long-term outcomes against T. trichiura based on CRs and ERRs of ivermectin-albendazole compared to albendazole were significantly higher at six months in Lao PDR (CR, 65.8 vs 13.4%, difference; 52.4; 95% CI 45.0C60.0; ERRs, 99.0 vs 79.6, difference 19.4; 95% CI 14.4C24.4) and Pemba Island (CR, 17.8 vs 1.4%, difference; 16.4; 95% CI 11.6C21.0; ERRs, 84.9 vs 21.2, difference 63.8; 95% CI 50.6C76.9) and also at 12 months in Lao PDR (CR, 74.0 vs 23.4%, difference; 50.6; 95% CI 42.6C61.0; ERRs, 99.6 vs 91.3, difference 8.3; 95% CI 5.7C10.8) and Pemba Island (CR, 19.5 vs 3.4%, difference; 16.1; 95% CI 10.7C21.5; ERRs, 92.9 vs 53.6, difference 39.3; 95% CI 31.2C47.4) respectively. Apparent reinfection rates with T. trichiura were considerably higher on Pemba Island (100.0%, 95% CI, 29.2C100.0) than in Lao PDR (10.0%, 95% CI, 0.2C44.5) at 12 months post-treatment for participants treated with albendazole alone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term outcomes against T. trichiura of ivermectin-albendazole are superior to albendazole in terms of CRs and ERRs and in reducing infection intensities. Our results will help to guide decisions on how to best use ivermectin-albendazole in the context of large-scale PC programs tailored to the local context to sustainably control STH infections.

The objective of this study was to compare rates of viral detection using singleplex and multiplex platforms in a research setting. METHODS: A prospective viral surveillance study was conducted in Davidson County, TN. Infants under one year who presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSVA and RSVB), human adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PIV1-4) and SARS-2-CoV by both singleplex qPCR and the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen and NxTAG CoV Extended panels. The rhinovirus/enterovirus, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and coronavirus HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 results from the Luminex panel were excluded because singleplex qPCR was not performed on those targets. For singleplex qPCR results, cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a surrogate for viral load, with a higher Ct value indicating a lower viral load. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal specimens were tested by both singleplex qPCR and Luminex, of which 65 were positive for at least one virus by either platform and 56 had a virus detected on both platforms (Figure 1). Seven specimens were positive by singleplex qPCR only and two were positive by Luminex only (Figure 1). The targets positive by singleplex qPCR only included FluB, RSVA, AdV and PIV2 and those positive by Luminex only included FluA H1N1 and RSVB (Figure 2). Specimens that were positive only on the singleplex assay had a higher average Ct value than those that were positive on both assays, indicating a lower viral load (Figure 3). Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] Figure 3 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The multiplex assay identified 89% of the total viruses detected while singleplex qPCR identified 97% of the total viruses detected. Lower viral loads may contribute to false negative results on the multiplex platforms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed in order validate our findings.

Recently, according to reports from several studies, the vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is mediated by anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complex in adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine recipients. It is impendent to explore whether inactivated COVID-19 vaccine widely used in China influences prothrombotic autoantibody production and induces thrombosis. In this prospective study, we recruited 406 healthcare workers who received two doses, 21 days apart, of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm). Paired blood samples taken before vaccination and four weeks after the second vaccination were used in detecting prothrombotic autoantibodies, including anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-2 glycoprotein I (a2GP1), anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), and anti-PF4-heparin. The seroconversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies was 95.81% (389/406) four weeks after vaccination. None of the subjects had spontaneous thrombosis or thrombocytopenia over a minimum follow-up period of eight weeks. There was no significant difference in the presence of all ten autoantibodies between samples collected before and after vaccination: for aCL, IgG (7 vs. 8, P = 0.76), IgM (41 vs. 44, P = 0.73), IgA (4 vs. 4, P = 1.00); anti-2GP1, IgG (7 vs. 6, P = 0.78), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76), IgA (3 vs. 5, P = 0.72); aPS/PT IgG (0 vs. 0, P = 1.00), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76); aPF4-heparin (2 vs. 7, P = 0.18), and antinuclear antibody (ANA) (18 vs. 21, P = 0.62). Notably, seven cases presented with anti-PF4-heparin antibodies (range: 1.18C1.79 U/mL) after vaccination, and none of them exhibited any sign of thrombotic disorder. In conclusion, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does not influence the profile of antiphospholipid antibody and anti-PF4-heparin antibody nor increase the risk of thrombosis.","output":"Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does not influence the profile of prothrombotic antibody nor increase the risk of thrombosis in a prospective Chinese cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been elevated to the mainstream of structural biology propelled by technological advancements in numerous fronts, including imaging analysis and the development of direct electron detectors.

The sample of the study consisted of (536) Saudis selected using convenient sampling method from the regions of Taif, Makkah, Najran and Al-Jawf in Saudi Arabia. In data collection, the study used two instruments developed by the researchers: \\"social distancing scale\\" and \\"psychological stress scale.\\" The study concluded that the commitment level to social distancing by the study sample during COVID-19 pandemic was moderate. It also revealed that there are statistically sig-nificant differences in the total commitment to social distancing due to age (in favour of 41-50 aged group), and the scientific qualification (in favour of holders of postgraduate degree), and that there were no statistically significant differences due to gender. The study concluded that the psychological stress level among the study sample was moderate. It also revealed that there are statistically significant differences in the psychological stress level among the study sample due to gender (in favour of females), and the scientific qualification (in favour of a secondary level or less), and that there were no statistically significant differences due to age. Furthermore, the study revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between the commitment level to social distancing and the exposure to psychological pressures.

We recently described a way to induce a potent SARS-CoV-2 CD8(+) T immune response through the generation of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging from muscle cells. This method relies on intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing different SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused at their N-terminus with the Nef(mut) protein, i.e., a very efficient EV-anchoring protein. However, quality, tissue distribution, and efficacy of these SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells remained uninvestigated. To fill the gaps, antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes induced by the immunization through the Nef(mut)-based method were characterized in terms of their polyfunctionality and localization at lung airways, i.e., the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that injection of vectors expressing Nef(mut)/S1 and Nef(mut)/N generated polyfunctional CD8(+) T lymphocytes in both spleens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs). When immunized mice were infected with 4.4 lethal doses of 50% of SARS-CoV-2, all S1-immunized mice succumbed, whereas those developing the highest percentages of N-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes resisted the lethal challenge. We also provide evidence that the N-specific immunization coupled with the development of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-resident memory cells in lungs, supporting the idea that the Nef(mut)-based immunization can confer a long-lasting, lung-specific immune memory. In view of the limitations of current anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of antibody waning and efficiency against variants, our CD8(+) T cell-based platform could be considered for a new combination prophylactic strategy.","output":"Strong SARS-CoV-2 N-Specific CD8(+) T Immunity Induced by Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Associates with Protection from Lethal Infection in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the use of telemedicine in rural areas has increased steadily over the years, its use was rapidly implemented during the onset of the COVID-19 crisis.

In order to provide a foundation/suggestion for future standardized workflows, the authors of this paper have developed standardized workflows via the Delphi method. These workflows were informed based on results from cross sectional surveys directed to patients and providers. The majority of patients and providers were satisfied, 87% and 71% respectively, with their telemedicine visits. Common issues that were raised with the use of telemedicine included difficulty in procuring physical laboratory results and a lack of personal warmth during telemedicine visits.

Several studies have been carried out to ascertain the presence of SARS?CoV?2 in the seminal fluid, with contrasting results;the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the testes and in the male genital tract led to speculation about the possible presence of the virus in the seminal fluid However, it was found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, used by the virus to enter host cells, are expressed differently in certain testicle cells (stem germ cells, Leydig and Sertoli cells), yet the testicle cells in which ACE2 and TMPRSS2 molecules are simultaneously expressed are rare This fact would suggest that the virus is not able to enter testicular cells, that it is not present in the seminal fluid and that it cannot infect male germ cells However, the direct influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the testes is still to be evaluated, and recent results are very controversial SARS-CoV-2 could enter the testicle using alternative paths and lead to alterations in testicular functionality Another plausible consideration is that the COVID-19 disease could also indirectly cause alterations to testicular activity, since the fever and the cytokinic storm generated by the immune system can lead to damage of the testicular activity, consequently compromising male fertility Although the literature provides controversial evidence, the purpose of this review is to lend a general overview about the state of the art Despite the lack of studies, it would represent a starting point for further investigation about the effect of this coronavirus on male fertility","output":"Coronavirus Disease-19 Infection: Implications on Male Fertility and Reproduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co-production is a process employed to solve complex issues, recognising the expertise of all stakeholders.

Tears in these tendons are common and often debilitating. There is uncertainty regarding both the histological and macroscopic features of hip abductor tears. This study aims to clarify both the macroscopic and microscopic features of the tendon and enthesis in hip abductor tendon tears. METHODS Thirty-six cadavers with an average age of 81 were dissected, and the hip abductor mechanisms removed en-bloc. The presence, location and size of the tears were recorded and analysed. The samples were processed into histological blocks and viewed using both transmitted and polarised light. Tendon histology was graded using the modified Movin's score in three sections (deep, middle and superficial layers) and the enthesis graded separately using 5-point criteria. Analysis of variance was used to confirm histological features associated with tears. RESULTS Tears were found in 24 of 36 samples (67%). The most common finding was an isolated tear in the gluteus minimus (46%), followed by concurrent gluteus medius and gluteus minimus tears (33%). Histology revealed significantly more degeneration in both the tendon (p = 0.0005) and enthesis (p = 0.0011) when tears were present. Furthermore, these changes were concentrated in the deeper layers of the tendon (p = 0.0002) and enthesis (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated degeneration as the primary pathology underlying hip abductor tendon tears. Degenerative changes occur in both the tendon and enthesis, with the deeper layers predominantly affected.

While numerous vaccines have been developed to combat this pandemic, limited literature is available regarding the comparison of these vaccines. This study aims to systematically review and evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines compared with control arms in the healthy adult population. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane up to July 4, 2021. Randomized controlled trials assessing the immunogenicity of any dose of COVID-19 vaccine in adults by antiCsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G antibodies geometric mean titers (GMTs) and neutralizing antibodies GMT response at 28 days postimmunization compared with the control groups in the healthy adults were considered for inclusion. Groups at day 28 with the highest GMT were further examined for their adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 341 citations retrieved, 19 were included. This covered a total of 16 vaccines involving 8342 subjects aged between 30.8 and 69.7 years, comprising 52.13% females. All studies reported GMT at or close to 28 days postvaccination compared with placebo and comparator, and 13 of 19 studies reported seroconversion rates.

METHODS: We weighed 10,147 blood cultures before and 11,806 blood cultures after a six-month educational intervention, during which employees were trained regarding correct filling volume via lectures, handouts, emails, and posters placed at strategic places. RESULTS: Before the educational intervention, only 31% of aerobic and 34% of anaerobic blood cultures were filled correctly with 5C10 ml of blood.

We show that intramuscular priming of mice with an alum and BcfA-adjuvanted Spike subunit vaccine, followed by a BcfA-adjuvanted mucosal booster, generated Th17 polarized tissue resident CD4+ T cells, and mucosal and serum antibodies. The serum antibodies efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and its Delta variant, suggesting cross-protection against a recent variant of concern (VOC). Immunization with this heterologous vaccine prevented weight loss following challenge with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 and reduced viral replication in the nose and lungs. Histopathology showed a strong leukocyte and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell infiltrate without epithelial damage in mice immunized with BcfA-containing vaccines. In contrast, viral load was not reduced in the upper respiratory tract of IL-17 knockout mice immunized with the same formulation, suggesting that the Th17 polarized T cell responses are critical for protection. We show that vaccines adjuvanted with alum and BcfA, delivered through a heterologous prime-pull regimen, protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing enhanced respiratory disease.

The overall survival analysis between high-risk and low-risk groups used the Kaplan-Meier method. Heatmap showed the correlation between risk groups and clinical characteristics. The univariate and multivariate models were established with Cox regression. RESULTS: SILAC-based quantitative proteomics found the protein expression levels of EIF4A3 and 116 EIF4A3-binding mRNAs were inhibited by ivermectin in OC cells. Among the analyzed 16 lncRNAs (HCG15, KIF9-AS1, PDCD4-AS1, ZNF674-AS1, ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, LINC00565, SNHG3, PLCH1-AS1, WWTR1-AS1, LINC00517, AL109767.1, STARD13-IT1, LBX2-AS1, LEMD1-AS1, and HOXC-AS3), only 7 lncRNAs (HCG15, KIF9-AS1, PDCD4-AS1, ZNF674-AS1, ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, and LINC00565) were obtained for further lasso regression when combined with the results of drug testing and overall survival analysis. Lasso regression identified the prognostic model of ivermectin-related three-lncRNA signature (ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, and LINC00565). The high-risk and low-risk groups based on the prognostic model were significantly related to overall survival and clinicopathologic characteristics (survival status, lymphatic invasion, cancer status, and clinical stage) in OC patients and remained independent risk factors according to multivariate COX analysis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Those findings provided the potential targeted lncRNA-EIF4A3-mRNA pathways of ivermectin in OC, and constructed the effective prognostic model, which benefits discovery of novel mechanism of ivermectin to suppress ovarian cancer cells, and the ivermectin-related molecule-panel changes benefit for its personalized drug therapy and prognostic assessment towards its predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) in OCs.

The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","output":"An Integrated Blueprint for Digital Mental Health Services Amidst COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute pancreatitis is characterized by zymogen pre-activation.

This investigative study asks whether domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are also susceptible to sitting in enclosures that are illusory in nature, utilizing cats attraction to box-like spaces to assess their perception of the Kanizsa square visual illusion. Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study's trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition;a formal examination into cats attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures;and study into cats susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.","output":"If I fits I sits: A citizen science investigation into illusory contour susceptibility in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The Burn unit offers a unique training environment for residents. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires all General Surgery trainees to have knowledge of burn physiology and experience with initial burn management. However, there are no burn requirements for other ACGME-sponsored training programs except for Plastic Surgery. Since care of the burned patient spans multiple settings C the intensive care unit, operating room, wards, outpatient clinic, and the emergency department C having residents from varied specialties might benefit not only the trainee, but also the Burn Center. Methods A retrospective review of all residents rotated to the burn center of an American Burn Association verified unit was performed. Data from the 7/2018-6/2018 academic year were collected by analyzing resident rotational and call schedules of both intra institutional and inter-institutional residents. The specific time period was chosen to account for COVID affecting the number of residents more recently. Results A total of 48 residents rotated at the burn center during the studied academic year. Within the institution, there were 34 residents (71%): 12 general surgery interns (8 categorical, 4 preliminary), 2 plastic surgery interns, 10 emergency medicine (EM) residents, and 10 anesthesia residents. There were 14 residents (29%) from 3 outside institutions: 3 plastic surgery residents, 8 surgery interns from one program, and 3 surgery interns from another program. All surgical specialty trainees were interns, whereas other specialties, EM and anesthesia, were PGY2 trainees. Conclusions While most residents were from general surgery and plastic surgery programs (58%) due to ACGME requirement, a significant portion of the resident complement (42%) was from non-surgical specialties. EM residents gain competency in wound reading as well as burn critical care. Anesthesia residents learn surgical management of the burn patient and critical care procedures.

Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus elevates heart rate (HR) prior to symptom onset, whether this virus evokes other presymptomatic alterations is unknown. This case study details the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young woman [24 yr, 173.5 cm, 89 kg, body mass index (BMI): 29.6 kgm-2]. Vascular and skeletal muscle function were assessed as part of a separate study with the first and second visits separated by 2 wk. On the evening following the second visit, the participant developed a fever and a rapid antigen test confirmed a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Compared with the first visit, the participant presented with a markedly elevated HR (a30 beats/min) and a lower mean blood pressure (a8 mmHg) at the second visit. Vascular function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, reactive hyperemia, and passive leg movement were all noticeably attenuated (25%-65%) as was leg blood flow during knee extension exercise. Muscle strength was diminished as was ADP-stimulated respiration (30%), assessed in vitro, whereas there was a 25% increase in the apparent Km. Lastly, an elevation in IL-10 was observed prior to symptom onset. Notably, 2.5 mo after diagnosis symptoms of fatigue and cough were still present. Together, these findings provide unique insight into the physiological responses immediately prior to onset of COVID-19 symptoms; they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 negatively impacts vascular and skeletal muscle function prior to the onset of common symptoms and may set the stage for the widespread sequelae observed following COVID-19 diagnosis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This unique case study details the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young predominantly presymptomatic woman.

Results of time-dependent inactivation of viruses on copper, bronze, and brass coupons revealed that 15 min of surface treatments of each of the copper and copper alloys achieved >4-log reduction of purified TV, as assessed by plaque assay, while up to 20 min of copper alloy surface treatments only achieved 2-log reduction, as assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay. As assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay, 10 min of copper surface treatments achieved reductions of 3 and 4 log units for HuNoVs GII.4 Sydney and GI.3B Potsdam, respectively. Results from this study suggest that even though PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay underestimated the efficacy of copper alloy surface inactivation of TV, copper alloy surfaces were able to effectively inactivate TV and HuNoVs.

In the presence of DNA damage, the normal cell cycle is perturbed when cells activate their repair processes. Although efficient, the repair system is not always able to ensure complete restoration of gene integrity. In these cases, mutations not only may occur, but the accumulation of lesions can either lead to carcinogenesis or reach a threshold that induces apoptosis and programmed cell death. Among the different types of DNA lesions, strand breaks produced by ionizing radiation are the most toxic due to the inherent difficultly of repair, which may lead to genomic instability. In this article we show, by using classical molecular simulation techniques, that compared to canonical double-helical B-DNA, guanine-quadruplex (G4) arrangements show remarkable structural stability, even in the presence of two strand breaks. Since G4-DNA is recognized for its regulatory roles in cell senescence and gene expression, including oncogenes, this stability may be related to an evolutionary cellular response aimed at minimizing the effects of ionizing radiation.","output":"Never Cared for What They Do: High Structural Stability of Guanine-Quadruplexes in the Presence of Strand-Break Damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether low cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with subsequent development of white matter hyperintensities (WMH).

Regions-of-interest (ROIs) were placed on FLAIR images in one of three categories: (1) WMH seen at both baseline and follow-up imaging, (2) new WMH seen only on follow-up imaging, and (3) regions of normal-appearing white matter at both time points.

Initial studies on patients in Wuhan, China showed anticoagulant therapy mainly with low molecular weight heparin was reported to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID\\\\19 patients meeting sepsis\\\\induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated D\\\\dimer. These studies fueled the need for anticoagulation protocols to be institutionalized broadly. Here we report the outcomes of patients on prophylactic compared to treatment dose anticoagulation early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This data reflects results before broad institutionalization of anticoagulation protocols for this novel disease in a Brooklyn, New York population. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of all laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital between March and April, 2020. Patient clinical characteristics were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients on treatment dose anticoagulation and patients on prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Primary outcome of this study was inpatient mortality among the two groups. Secondary outcomes were thromboembolisms (both arterial and venous), myocardial infarction (MI), major bleeding, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, invasive mechanical ventilation and initiation of dialysis. Odds ratio and p-values were obtained using univariate analysis. Results We analyzed 580 hospitalized patients with confirmed nasopharyngeal COVID19 infection. Of these, 82 patients were on treatment dose anticoagulation 498 patients were on prophylactic dose. Median age was 70 years in treatment dose group and 66 years in prophylactic dose group. Percentage of males were similar between both groups (53%). African American race(56% vs 46%) was the predominant race in both groups. Median BMI was 28.1 in both groups. Percentage of smokers was higher in the treatment dose group (34% compared to 21%). Patients in the treatment dose group had a higher rate of all the comorbidities. Median D-Dimer (630 vs 590) was higher in the treatment dose group. Rates of ICU admission in treatment dose group and prophylactic dose group was 44% and 22% respectively. Patients requiring intubation (43% vs 24%) and transfusion (24% and 7%) were higher in the treatment dose group. There was an increased incidence of thromboembolic events in the treatment dose group as compared to prophylactic dose group with DVT (15.6% vs 1.6%) PE (3.7% vs 0.2%), arterial thrombosis (1.2% vs 0%) and MI (6.1% vs 1.6%). Incidence of major bleeding was higher in the treatment group (10% vs3.5%) Discussion Our study found increased inpatient mortality with treatment dose anticoagulation and increased risk of bleeding when compared with prophylactic dose anticoagulation. These findings may be due to higher rates of comorbidities, smoking and older age when compared to the prophylactic anticoagulation group. Higher rates of bleeding raises concern for the safety of treatment dose anticoagulation in these populations. Some limitations of this study include: uneven sample size between the two groups and data was collected from patients before anticoagulation dose recommendations were standardized and officially implemented. Further randomized control trials are needed to evaluate the dose- dependent relationship between anticoagulation and mortality. Our study suggests that the treatment dose anticoagulation may adversely affect the outcomes in COVID-19 patients who are older and have multiple comorbidities. Therefore, the anticoagulation dose must be chosen carefully given the overall clinical picture.

As a disease, COVID-19 can lead to severe and occasionally fatal respiratory problems in humans. Infection with this virus is associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, and muscle aches, and it may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment against this virus. However, the main viral protease has been recently discovered and it is regarded as an appropriate target for antiviral agents in the search for treatment of COVID-19, due to its pivotal role in polyproteins processing during viral replication.

METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort of the Northern Ireland adult population using national linked primary care registration, vaccination, secondary care and pharmacy dispensing data. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses investigated the association between anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and hypnotic use and COVID-19 vaccination status, accounting for age, gender, deprivation and comorbidities. Receiving any COVID-19 vaccine was the primary outcome. RESULTS: There were 1 433 814 individuals, of whom 1 166 917 received a COVID-19 vaccination. Psychotropic medications were dispensed to 267 049 people. In univariable analysis, people who received any psychotropic medication had greater odds of receiving COVID-19 vaccination: odds ratio (OR) = 1.42 (95% CI 1.41-1.44). However, after adjustment, psychotropic medication use was associated with reduced odds of vaccination (ORadj = 0.90, 95% CI 0.89-0.91).

This Perspective focuses on the large number of deaths that occurred in nursing homes during the first wave of the pandemic, and the weak capacity of public policy to provide them with adequate protection. The analysis focuses on the case of the Lombardy Region, where the mortality rate due to COVID-19 in nursing homes was the highest in Europe. In the search for possible causes, we investigate the situation of such facilities before the pandemic. Two aspects are analyzed: their institutional embeddedness and recent trends in their management.

Being highly transmissible, this novel coronavirus disease has spread fast all over the world. COVID-19 continues to challenge most developed countries in the search for an effective strategy to either prevent infection or to avoid the spreading of the disease. While several developed countries have managed to contain COVID-19, several countries in Latin America continue to report an increase in the daily number of infected people. Ecuador, particularly, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the region during March and April 2020. In this context, the present study shows a simple mathematical approach to understand the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ecuador (and some Latin American countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia). The proposed method is based on the exponential model, discrete logistic equation, and differential logistic model using one-year data from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. This study presents the estimated growth rate coefficient (), the total number of cases (N), and the midpoint of maximum infection (t_0) as well as the variability of the  coefficient as a function of total cases and time. The exponential model shows a high value of =0.185 which decreases to =0.014 and =0.056 according to the discrete and differential logistic models, respectively. An accurate value of the total number of cases of infected people was found by analyzing the number of daily cases as a function of the total of cases whose value (N~409 K) agrees with the data reported at the end of May 2021, validating the proposed approach. How to use the current mathematical approach for long-term prediction is also discussed here. Most importantly, the proposed method has two important characteristics: (i) the mathematical model is as simple as possible compared to other time-consuming approaches, and (ii) it can be used to study the effect of COVID-19 and predicts its consequences in other countries, allowing revenue new decisions against the COVID-19 disease. ? 2021 by the authors.

METHODS Medical records of consecutive patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty performed by the senior authors (A.L. and G.W.C.) at Emory University Hospital between 1997 and 2018 were reviewed. Data regarding patient demographics, personal or family history of malignancy, operative technique, pathologic findings, and follow-up were extracted. Patients were categorized into two groups, those with and those without breast cancer. Group A patients underwent reduction for symptomatic macromastia, and group B underwent contralateral reduction for unilateral breast cancer treated with oncoplastic partial or total breast cancer reconstruction. Pathologic findings were divided into four groups; normal, benign, high-risk, and malignant. RESULTS A total 1014 patients (1419 breast reductions) were included in the study. Comparing groups A and B, mean age was 37.8  16.2 years versus 54.5  11.1 years (p < 0.001), mean body mass index was 34.1  7.6 kg/m2 versus 33.3  7.4 kg/m2 (p = 0.2), and average reduction weight was 875.6  491 g versus 723.7  438 g (p < 0.001). The incidence of high-risk or malignant lesions was 1.8 percent (n = 15) in group A and 8 percent (n = 49) in group B (p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age and personal history of breast cancer were positive predictors for high-risk and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of abnormal pathologic findings in breast reduction specimens is not uncommon, and occult malignancy or high-risk lesions can be found, especially in patients with contralateral breast cancer.

This review compiles current evidence available in the scientific literature on the use of probiotics to treat metabolic diseases and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to analyze the efficacy of probiotics in these diseases. To do this, we must first define the healthy gut microbiome before looking at the interplay between the gut microbiome and diseases, and how probiotics affect this interaction. In metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, probiotic supplementation positively impacts pathological parameters. Conversely, the gutCbrain axis significantly impacts neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASDs. However, manipulating the gut microbiome and disease symptoms using probiotics has less pronounced effects on neurodevelopmental diseases. This may be due to a more complex interplay between genetics and the environment in these diseases. In conclusion, the use of microbe-based probiotic therapy may potentially have beneficial effects in ameliorating the pathology of various diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four healthy, right-handed subjects filled their bladders by drinking water. The subjects were scanned under an empty bladder and a strong desire to void states. The Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated among 90 brain regions in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas to construct the brain functional network. A paired t test (P < .05, after false discovery rate [FDR] correction) was used to detect significant differences in the FC, topologic properties (small-world parameters [gamma, sigma], Cp, Lp, Eglob, Eloc, and Enodal) between the two states in all subjects. RESULTS: Both the two states showed small-world network properties. The clustering coefficient (Cp) and local efficiency (Eloc) in the whole brain network decreased, while the FC within the default mode network (DMN) increased during the strong desire to void compared with the empty bladder state. Moreover, an increased nodal efficiency (Enodal) was detected in the basal ganglia (BG), DMN, sensorimotor-related network (SMN), and visual network (VN). CONCLUSION: We detected FC changes and topologic property alterations in brain functional networks caused by a strong desire to void in healthy and suggest that the micturition control may be a process dominated by DMN and coordinated by multiple sub-networks (such as, BG, SMN, and VN), which could serve as a baseline for understanding the pathologic process underlying bladder dysfunction and be useful to improve targeted therapy in the future.","output":"Brain functional network alterations caused by a strong desire to void in healthy adults: a graph theory analysis study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the philosophy of other international programs as proximity policing or situational crime prevention, the Local Safety Contracts (CLS) have been an innovative strategy in Portugal, as they allow the sharing of accountabilities between the central and the local administration, in association with the police and the community.

We have identified IFN-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFN anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFN was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFN-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFN-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 h apart, for a total of 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFN-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFN-1a in COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFN-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease. In case IFN-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-002458-25.

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014).

METHODS Patients who suffered from fractures or soft-tissue trauma between March 21, 2020, and June 1, 2020, (group pandemic) and during the same period in 2019 (control group) were included in our single-center retrospective study. Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients ( 20 years, 21-64 years, and  65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups. RESULTS A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P < 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 2000 individuals, from Qatar BioBank, was evaluated to determine features predictive of T2DM and IGM. Another sample of 1000 participants was obtained for external validation of the models. Several scoring models screening for T2DM were evaluated and compared to the model proposed by this study. RESULTS: Age, gender, waist-to-hip-ratio, history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and levels of educational were statistically associated with the risk of T2DM and constituted the Qatar diabetes mellitus risk score (QDMRISK). Along with, the 6 aforementioned variables, the IGM model showed that BMI was statistically significant. The QDMRISK performed well with area under the curve (AUC) 0.870 and .815 in the development and external validation cohorts, respectively. The QDMRISK showed overall better accuracy and calibration compared to other evaluated scores. The IGM model showed good accuracy and calibration, with AUCs .796 and .774 in the development and external validation cohorts, respectively.

Although Indonesian government has gradually allowed people to do outdoor activities, there are still large-scale restrictions on doing activities in public places. Palembang is one of biggest cities in Indonesia, in which students and workers have been learning and working from home during the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to analyse the physical activity levels and body mass index (BMI) profiles of the working-age population in Palembang, Indonesia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 735 participants (M: 416;F: 319) with a minimum age of 15 (26.149.46) participated in this study. The method of this study was a survey using an online Short-Form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) to assess physical activity and energy expenditure levels based on Metabolic Equivalents of Task (MET). The data was collected for 4 weeks in February 2021 by measuring the height and weight and by observing the physical activity behaviour of the participants through the survey. The results of the BMI calculation showed that almost half of the participants were a combination of underweight, overweight, and obese, while participants in the normal category included only slightly more than half. The results of the physical activity level showed that more than half of the participants were in the low and medium category, while participants in the high category included slightly fewer than 40%. Thus, the working-age population in Palembang City needs to increase their physical activity and maintain their nutritional intake to improve their BMI levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

The organizational consequences of quarantine/isolation are: absence of organized training and competition, lack of communication among athletes and coaches, inability to move freely, lack of adequate sunlight exposure, inappropriate training conditions. Based on the current scientific, we strongly recommend encouraging the athlete to reset their mindset to understand quarantine as an opportunity for development, organizing appropriate guidance, educating and encourage athletes to apply appropriate preventive behavior and hygiene measures to promote immunity and ensuring good living isolation conditions. The athletes living space should be equipped with cardio and resistance training equipment (portable bicycle or rowing ergometer). Some forms of body mass resistance circuit-based training could promote aerobic adaptation. Sports skills training should be organized based on the athletes needs. Personalized conditioning training should be carried out with emphasis on neuromuscular performance. Athletes should also be educated about nutrition (Vitamin D and proteins) and hydration.

The goal of this study was to prospectively evaluate the utility and discerning power of two different ventilator triage models (Whit & Lo and New York guidelines). METHODS: Prospective observational study of consecutive patients (N=1076) admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic from May to August 2020. New York State triage criteria and those proposed by White and Lo were applied. Characteristics and outcomes of those meeting initial criteria for the lowest level of priority for mechanical ventilation (using both criteria) were assessed. Agreement was compared between the 2 sets of triage criteria RESULTS: Among 1076 patients who received mechanical ventilation, the mean (SD) age was 60.5 (15.6) years, 618 (57.4%) were males, 659 (61.5%) were Caucasian, the mean BMI (SD) 30.4 (10.0), 135 (12.5%) had COVID and their SOFA score on admission day was 6.4 (3.0). Comparing the White and Lo triage criteria vs New York guidelines, 159 patients (14.7%) were in the lowest priority category vs 76 patients (7.06%);the mean (SD) age of 63.5 (15.2) years vs 56.2 (15.0) years, 88 (55.3%) vs 42 (55.3%) were males, 104 (65.4%) vs 52 (68.4%) were Caucasian, the mean BMI (SD) 28.8 (7.3) vs30.9 (8.5), 17 (10.7%) vs 4 (5.3%) had COVID, the mean (SD) SOFA score on admission day was 10.2 (2.9) vs 12.9 (1.4), 103 (64.8%) vs 63 (82.9%) patient received MV, the mean (SD) day on MV was 3.7 (5.6) vs 5.5 (6.8), 85 (53.5%) vs 37 (48.7%) survived. Only 63 admissions (5%) were in the lowest priority category for both guidelines, with the  statistic for agreement equal to 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Five percent of admissions were identified as having the lowest priority for ventilator allocation using proposed guidelines with moderate agreement.

This study aims to apply a compartmental model for predicting the variations of epidemiological parameters in Sri Lanka. We used a dynamic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated (SEIRV) model, and simulated for potential vaccine strategies under a range of epidemic conditions. The predictions were based on different vaccination coverages (5% to 90%), vaccination-rates (1%, 2%, 5%) and vaccine-efficacies (40%, 60%, 80%) under different R0 (2,4,6). We observed how the above dynamics influenced the SEIRV model without COVID-19 vaccination at different R0 values, and estimated the duration, exposed and infected populations. When the R0 was increased, the days of reduction of susceptibility and the days to reach the peak of the infection were reduced gradually. At least 45% vaccine coverage is required for reducing the infected population as early as possible. The results revealed that when R0 is increased in the SEIRV model along with the increase of vaccination efficacy and vaccination rate, the population to be vaccinated is reducing. Thus, the vaccination offers greater benefits to the local population by reducing the time to reach the peak, exposed and infected population through flattening the curves.","output":"An Extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Model with Vaccination for Forecasting the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite tremendous progress in the understanding of COVID-19, mechanistic insight into immunological, disease-driving factors remains limited.

MaVie16 induced profound pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and the resulting mouse COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) replicated critical aspects of human disease, including early lymphopenia, pulmonary immune cell infiltration, pneumonia and specific adaptive immunity.

It is important for practitioners to understand how their patients are affected by events to optimize their care. In this study we evaluated associations of anxiety and daily habits with self-reported sleep disturbance among sleep medicine clinic patients. METHODS: Between June-November 2020, 81 sleep medicine clinic patients (54.815.9 y, 44% male, 69% Caucasian) completed an online survey that included PROMIS measures (Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-Related Impairments, Informational Support, Emotional Distress-Anxiety) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Patients were asked about changes in their daily habits (sunlight exposure, caffeine consumption). During the 5-month survey completion time window, the weekly average of positive COVID-19 cases in the Houston area was 2,914. Stepwise linear regression was performed using SAS to determine if self-reported anxiety and informational support predicted PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairments and ISI. RESULTS: Anxiety had a significant effect on Sleep Disturbance (0.43  0.11, p=0.0001), Sleep-Related Impairments (0.53  0.12, p=0.0001) and ISI (0.28  0.08, p=0.0004). Informational support had a significant inverse effect on Sleep Disturbance (-0.29  0.10, p=0.0063), Sleep-Related Impairments (-0.26  0.11, p=0.01) and ISI (-0.31  0.08, p<0.0001) measures. Decreased sunlight exposure during the pandemic contributed to a significant increase in Sleep Disturbance scores (0.06  0.03, p=0.045). Increased caffeine consumption during the pandemic had significant increase in ISI scores (16.3  7.59, p=0.035). CONCLUSION: Higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of informational support predicted greater insomnia severity, sleep disturbance, and sleep-related impairments in sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased sunlight exposure and increased caffeine consumption also predicted greater sleep disturbance and insomnia severity, respectively.

The NIH Clinical Center has used the BioFire FilmArray multiplex PCR respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) for evaluation of upper respiratory symptoms since 2014. Beginning in 3/20, respiratory samples from symptomatic patients were tested by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and the RPP. We performed a retrospective study comparing frequency and rates of community respiratory viruses detected by RPP from 1/14 through 3/21. METHODS: Results of RPPs from nasopharyngeal swabs/washes, bronchoalveolar lavages, and bronchial washes were included. Results from viral challenge studies were excluded. Charts were reviewed to determine whether repeat positives for the same virus within 12 months represented new infections; repeats from the same infection were excluded. A quantitative data analysis was completed using cross tabulations; comparisons were done using mixed models, applying Dunnetts correction for multiplicity. RESULTS: A total of 3,329 patients underwent 8,122 RPPs from 1/14 through 3/21. Frequency of all respiratory pathogens declined from an annual range of 0.88-1.97% from 1/14-3/20 to 0.29% in 4/20-3/21 (p < 0.001). Individual viral pathogens declined sharply in frequency during the pandemic, with zero cases of influenza A/B, parainfluenza, or metapneumovirus detected from 4/20-3/21. One case each of adenovirus, RSV, CoV OC43, and CoV HKU1 were detected in 4/20-3/21. Rhino/enterovirus detection continued, but with a substantially lower frequency of 4.27% in 4/20-3/21, compared with an annual range of 8.65-18.28% from 1/14-3/20 (p < 0.001). [Image: see text] Frequency of detection of all respiratory pathogens tested using the Biofire FilmArray multiplex PCR respiratory pathogen panel from January 2014 through March 2021. The frequency of pathogen detection from April 2020 through March 2021 declined substantially in comparison with previous years. [Image: see text] Frequency of detection of influenza A, influenza B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (1, 2, 3, 4), and respiratory syncytial virus from January 2014 through March 2021. The frequency of detection of these pathogens declined sharply starting in April 2020. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, the burden of viral respiratory infections detected among patients at the NIH Clinical Center improved considerably. This reprieve was likely thanks to the layered COVID-19 prevention and mitigation measures implemented in the community and the hospital: masking, distancing, symptom screening, isolation and testing symptomatic persons. As COVID-19 vaccination allows relaxation of masking, community transmission of respiratory viruses will likely resume; continued mask-wearing in the hospital may provide an enduring benefit by preventing nosocomial transmission.

In total, 271 isolates representing 50 Legionella species were tested and the assay was validated using 39 culture-positive and 110 culture-negative patient specimens collected between 1989 and 2006. PCR-positive results were obtained with all 39 culture-positive samples (100% sensitivity). Specimens that tested positive according to 23S-5S PCR, but were culture-negative, were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon or the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene. In addition to L. pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella cincinnatiensis and Legionella micdadei were identified in the specimens. The assay showed a 7-log dynamic range displaying a sensitivity of 7.5 CFU/mL or three genome equivalents per reaction. Sixty-one specimens containing viruses or bacteria other than Legionellae were negative according to 23S-5S PCR, demonstrating its specificity.

OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the period prevalence of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, and the proportion of the infected population that remained undiagnosed in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia. METHODS: A model-based mathematical framework based on a disease progression and transmission model was developed to estimate the historical prevalence of COVID-19 using provincial-level statistics reporting seroprevalence, diagnoses, and deaths resulting from COVID-19. The framework was applied to three different age cohorts (< 30; 30-69; and 70 years) in each of the provinces studied. RESULTS: The estimates of COVID-19 period prevalence between March 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, were 4.73% (95% CI 4.42%-4.99%) for Quebec, 2.88% (95% CI 2.75%-3.02%) for Ontario, 3.27% (95% CI 2.72%-3.70%) for Alberta, and 2.95% (95% CI 2.77%-3.15%) for British Columbia.

Data were analysed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS GTN-treated group experienced significantly less pain during the first week after surgery (p < 0.0001). This difference was more evident starting from post-operative day 4 (p < 0.0001). A significant higher percentage of untreated patients experienced severe pain (mean VAS score > 7) (10 % vs 31 %). There were significant differences in terms of secretion time (p = 0.0052) and bleeding time (p = 0.02) in favor of GTN. In addition, the duration of itching was less in the GTN group (p = 0.0145). Patients treated with GTN were able to an early return to daily activities compared to untreated (p < 0.0001). Fifteen GTN-treated patients (14.6 %) discontinued the application because of local discomfort and headache. CONCLUSIONS GTN ointment enhances significantly post-operative recovery, reducing pain in terms of duration and intensity. This effect might be secondary to a faster wound healing expressed by reduced secretion, bleeding and itching time.","output":"Role of 0.4% glyceryl trinitrate ointment after haemorrhoidectomy: results of a prospective randomised study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants but its economic burden is not well documented. Our objective was to describe the clinical evolution and to assess the 1-month cost of a first episode of acute bronchiolitis presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS Our study was an epidemiologic analysis and a cost study of the cohort drawn from the clinical trial GUERANDE, conducted in 24 French pediatric EDs. Infants of 6 weeks to 12 months of age presenting at pediatric EDs with a first episode of bronchiolitis were eligible. The costs considered were collected from a societal viewpoint, according to the recommendations of the French National Health Authority. RESULTS A total of 777 infants were included with a median age of 4 months. A total of 57% were hospitalized during the month following the first consultation in the ED, including 28 (3.6%) in an intensive care unit. The mean length of stay was 4.2 days (SD = 3.7). The average time to relief of all symptoms was 13 days (SD = 7). Average total cost per patient was 1919 (95% confidence interval: 1756-2138) from a societal perspective, mostly due to hospitalization cost. The estimated annual cost of bronchiolitis in infants was evaluated to be between 160 and 273 million in France. DISCUSSION Bronchiolitis represent a high cost for the health care system and broadly for society, with hospitalizations costs being the main cost driver. Thus significant investments should be made to develop innovative therapies, to reduce the number of hospitalizations and length of stay.","output":"Clinical course and cost assessment of infants with a first episode of acute bronchiolitis presenting to the emergency department: Data from the GUERANDE clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Testing individuals suspected of severe acute respiratory syndromeClike coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is essential to reduce the spread of disease. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the false negativity rate of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test when utilized for testing individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Concurrent swab samples were collected from patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection by their healthcare provider within two different urgent care centers located in Easton, MA, USA and East Bridgewater, MA, USA. One swab was tested using the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test. Negative results in patients considered at moderate to high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed at a regional reference laboratory by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the additional swab sample. The data included in this study was collected retrospectively as an analysis of routine clinical practice. RESULTS: From October 19, 2020 to January 3, 2021, a total of 2241 tests were performed using the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test, with 549 (24.5%) testing positive and 1692 (75.5%) testing negative. A subset (800) of the samples rendering a negative LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test was also tested using a PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2. Of this subset, 770 (96.3%) tested negative, and 30 (3.8%) tested positive. Negative results obtained with the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test demonstrated 96.3% agreement with PCR-based tests (CI 95%, 94.7C97.4%).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of CAPE on acrolein-induced airway remodeling. 24 mice were divided into 4 groups: control group; acrolein group, mice received acrolein (inhalation of acrolein for 20 days); CAPE group, mice received CAPE (30 mg/kg); and acrolein+CAPE group, mice received acrolein and CAPE. After 20 days, lung tissue was removed for histopathology and immunohistochemical evaluations. TGF-?1 and Muc5ac levels were measured at the protein and molecular levels. Additionally, the phospho-P65/P65 values in the airway smooth muscle cells treated with TGF-?1 or CAPE were detected by Western blot. The results showed that compared with the control, subepithelial collagen deposition, airway inflammation, and peribronchus fibrosis were inhibited in the group treated with CAPE. Furthermore, TGF-?1 was significantly decreased in the acrolein+CAPE group compared with the acrolein group. Additionally, we identified CAPE inhibited P65 phosphorylation. However, CAPE did not inhibit the Muc5ac overproduction and hypersecretion induced by acrolein. In conclusion, as an inhibitor of the NF-B pathway, CAPE attenuated the release of TGF-?1, which inhibited the fibrogenic progress induced by acrolein in mice and took no effect on inhibiting airway mucus hypersecretion.","output":"An Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Pathway Attenuates the Release of TGF-?1 and Inhibits the Fibrogenic Progress in a Model of Airway Remodeling Induced by Acrolein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that is involved in severe diarrhea disease in piglets, causing considerable agricultural and economic loss in China.

SLN type II nanoformulations were synthesized and characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential and transmission electron microscope. (3) Results: The synthesized NLCs showed spherical shaped, homogenous, narrow, and monomodal particle size distribution. The mortality percent (MO%) post-treatment (PT) with 2000 ppm for 24 h with fennel oil and NLC fennel (NLC-F) reached 85% (LC50 = 643.81 ppm) and 100% (LC50 = 251.71), whereas MO% for green tea oil and NLC green tea (NLC-GT) were 80% (LC50 = 746.52 ppm) and 100% (LC50 = 278.63 ppm), respectively. Field trial data showed that the larval reduction percent of fennel oil and NLC-F reached 89.8% and 97.4%, 24 h PT and the reduction percent of green tea oil and NLC-GT reached 89% and 93%, 24 h PT with persistence reached 8 and 7 days, for NLC-F and NLC-GT, respectively. The adulticidal effects showed that NLC-F and NLC-GT (100% mortality) were more effective than fennel and green tea oils (90.0% and 83.33%), with 24 h PT, respectively. Moreover, their reduction of adult density after spraying with LC95 X2 for 15 min, with fennel oil, NLC-F, and green tea oil, NLC-GT were 83.6%, 100%, 79.1%, and 100%, respectively, with persistence (>50%) lasting for three days.

However, limited data exists on the impact of dapivirine on the vaginal microenvironment in adolescents. DESIGN: A comprehensive metaproteomics approach was used to assess host proteome and microbiome changes in cervicovaginal mucus with dapivirine ring use in adolescents enrolled in the MTN-023/IPM 030 (MTN-023) trial. METHODS: Participants were randomized 3 : 1 to use dapivirine or placebo vaginal rings monthly for 6 months. Cervicovaginal samples from a subset of 35 participants (8 placebo, 27 dapivirine) were analyzed. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis identified 405 human and 2467 bacterial proteins belonging to 15 unique genera. The host proteome belonged to many functional pathways primarily related to inflammation. When stratified by study treatment arm, 18 (4.4%) and 28 (6.9%) human proteins were differentially abundant (adjusted P < 0.05) between baseline and follow-up in the placebo and dapivirine arms, respectively. The vaginal microbiome was predominantly composed of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and Prevotella. Although bacterial taxa did not differ by arm or change significantly, Lactobacillus crispatus increased (P < 0.001) and Lactobacillus iners decreased (P < 0.001) during the 6-month follow-up.

This study explores the use of sidetone regulation during audio-visual communication as one potential technique to alleviate the effects of telecommunication on the voice. METHOD The speech acoustics of 18 participants with typical voices were measured during conversational tasks during three conditions of sidetone amplification: baseline (no sidetone amplification), low sidetone amplification, and high sidetone amplification. Vocal intensity, vocal quality (estimated using acoustic measures of the low-high ratio and the smoothed cepstral peak prominence), and self-perceived vocal effort were used to measure the impacts of sidetone amplification on vocal function. RESULTS Compared to baseline, there were statistically significant decreases in vocal intensity and increases in low-high ratio in the high level of sidetone amplification condition. Changes in these measures were not significantly correlated. When asked to rank conditions based on their perceived vocal effort, participants most often ranked the high level of sidetone amplification as least effortful; however, the visual-analog ratings of vocal effort were not significantly different between conditions. The smoothed cepstral peak prominence did not change with varying levels of sidetone amplification. CONCLUSIONS Vocal intensity decreased with high levels of sidetone amplification. High levels of sidetone amplification also resulted in increases in the low-high ratio, which were shown to be more than just a byproduct of decreased vocal intensity. The impact of sidetone amplification on vocal effort was less clear, but results suggested that participants generally decreased their vocal effort with increased levels of sidetone amplification.

METHODOLOGY: The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher.

This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation of Schwartz Rounds? (Rounds) in UK healthcare organizations, predominantly part of the National Health Service (NHS). Rounds are one-hour, typically monthly, multidisciplinary forums during which clinical and nonclinical healthcare staff discuss the emotional and social demands of delivering patient care. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of Rounds attendance on the psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection of healthcare staff. METHODS: We used a pre-post control design to assess the effect of Rounds attendance across 10 UK healthcare organizations. This design was most appropriate given the voluntary nature of Rounds and ensured the study had ecological validity. Self-reported data were collected from attenders and non-attenders at baseline and at eight-months follow-up. The outcomes were psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. RESULTS: During the 8 months study duration, regular attenders (N = 51) attended Rounds on average 4 times (2C8).

However, Rounds attendance had no significant effect on work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. CONCLUSIONS: Rounds attendance was linked to a 19% reduction in psychological distress adjusting for covariates. As an organization-wide intervention, Rounds thus constitute an effective, relatively low-cost intervention to assist staff in dealing with the demands of their work and to improve their well-being.

Background. Learning from the SARS epidemic pointed to the importance of quality nursing practice considerations that minimize cross-transmission of infection while maximizing patient-focused care. Hence, a modular nursing model was adopted. DESIGN AND METHOD This study comprised pre- and postintervention phases. Data collection tools to evaluate modular nursing practice included a work sampling observation checklist, focused group interviews with nurses, questionnaires addressing nurses' perceived competence and caring attributes, a patient satisfaction questionnaire, and a hand hygiene audit. A series of education sessions were conducted between the two phases. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used for data triangulation. RESULTS Modular nursing practice, focusing on continuity of care, led to changes in the nature of direct care activities and improvement in patient/family education frequency. Also, a general increase in nurses' hand washing frequency was noted. However, when nurses perceived time pressure, a lapse in hand hygiene compliance was found. Because of human resource and inefficiency issues, some nurses in the studied wards did not embrace geographical separation for infection control. Positive correlations were found for nurses' perceived infection control practice competence and their perceived caring attributes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A convenience sample of therapists (physical and occupational) and students were enrolled in pairs in a cohort study with pre- versus post-training comparisons. The intervention was a hybrid of self-study and hands-on practice paired with remote feedback for ten intermediate and advanced manual wheelchair skills. Participants practiced with self-selected frequency and duration, uploading a session log and video(s) to an online platform. A remote trainer provided asynchronous feedback prior to the next practice session. Capacity and confidence in completing the ten skills were evaluated using the Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q). Knowledge of wheelchair skills training and motor learning was assessed using a 62-item Knowledge Test. Secondary outcome measures included skill achievement, as confirmed by submitted video recordings, and participant feedback about the training. RESULTS Across 41participants, scores were higher at follow-up compared to baseline for WST-Q capacity (73.9  19.1 vs 16.8  15.6, p < 0.001), WST-Q confidence (80.1  12.2 vs 47.6  18.2, p = 0.003) and knowledge (70.8  7.5 vs 67.0  5.4, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Remote learning can increase wheelchair skills capacity and confidence as well as knowledge about such training and assessment. This model should be further investigated as a delivery method for training rehabilitation professionals. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT01807728. Implications for rehabilitation Wheelchair skills training is one of the 8 steps of wheelchair provision as outlined by the World Health Organization. Wheelchair skills are not a core part of most clinical curriculums and many clinicians cite a lack of resources and uncertainty on how to implement wheelchair skills training into practice as major barriers to providing such training. Remote learning offers the benefits of structured wheelchair skills training with expert feedback on an individual's own schedule that is not afforded by one-day \\"bootcamp\\"-type courses or on-the-job training, which are how many clinicians currently learn wheelchair skills. In a sample of physical and occupational therapists and students, remote learning was effective at increasing capacity and confidence to perform manual wheelchair skills as well as knowledge of wheelchair training.","output":"Using remote learning to teach clinicians manual wheelchair skills: a cohort study with pre- vs post-training comparisons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated schools implementing Covid-19 risk-reduction measures. MethodsWe investigated young people, parent and school staff attitudes towards secondary school Covid-19 mitigation measures. Recruitment used school communication, community organisations and snowball sampling. Audio recorded online/phone individual/group interviews lasted 45 minutes. Interviews focused on social distancing, hand-hygiene and testing. Team framework analysis used interview notes and transcripts. ResultsParticipants were 13 school staff, 20 parents and 17 young people. Concerns about Covid-19 risk at school, especially to vulnerable individuals, were outweighed by perceived risks of not returning to school. Some teachers anticipated guilt around being a potential spreader. Participants saw school mitigation measures as an acceptable and pragmatic solution to the impossibility of social distancing, although anticipated challenges in changing habitual behaviour. Participants supported school Covid-19 testing but identified the need to consider data security and stigma. Staff were concerned about unintended consequences of risk-reduction strategies and widening inequalities. ConclusionFamilies and staff supported Covid-19 mitigation measures in schools. Clear messaging and engendering collective responsibility are important for compliance and success. However, schools and policy makers should consider unintended consequences of measures, supporting vulnerable individuals and those with additional needs, and avoiding widening inequalities.","output":"Reducing Covid-19 risk in schools: a qualitative examination of staff and family views and concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) is an effective treatment for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and venom allergy. Compliance is essential for SCIT to obtain maximal benefit as it is a long-term treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the level of real-life SCIT compliance in pediatric patients and the associated factors. Additional aims were to determine how SCIT compliance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and why some patients dropped out SCIT. METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or venom allergy that received SCIT between September 2012 and July 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 201 children (66.7% male) with a median (interquartile range) age of 12.8 years (9.4-15.2) at the time of the first SCIT injection. The overall compliance rate before COVID-19 pandemic was 86.1%. Short SCIT follow-up time and venom anaphylaxis were found to be risk factors for drop out. The leading causes of drop outs were moving to another city/country (32.1%), symptom improvement (17.8%), treatment ineffectiveness (14.2%), and adverse reactions (14.2%). Among the 108 patients that were still receiving SCIT during the COVID-19 pandemic, 31 (28.7%) dropped out the therapy. The most frequent reasons for drop-out were fear of being infected with COVID-19 (35.4%) and thinking that the AIT practise stopped due to COVID-19 pandemic (29%). Male gender and older age were found to be the independent risk factors for drop-out of SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Real life compliance in children was found 13.9% and it was higher than adults.

This includes both traditional US scans performed by radiology departments as well as point-of-care US (POCUS) performed by bedside clinicians. There has been significant interest in better understanding the appropriate use of imaging and where opportunities to enhance cost-effectiveness may exist. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify published evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of US in the ED and to grade the quality of that evidence. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were considered for inclusion if they were: (1) economic evaluations, (2) studied the clinical use of ultrasound, and (3) took place in an emergency care setting. Included studies were critically appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. RESULTS We identified 631 potentially relevant articles. Of these, 35 studies met all inclusion criteria and were eligible for data abstraction. In general, studies were supportive of the use of US. In particular, 11 studies formed a strong consensus that US enhanced cost-effectiveness in the investigation of pediatric appendicitis and 6 studies supported enhancements in the evaluation of abdominal trauma. Across the studies, weaknesses in methodology and reporting were common, such as lack of sensitivity analyses and inconsistent reporting of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS The body of existing evidence, though limited, generally demonstrates that the inclusion of US in emergency care settings allows for more cost-effective care. The most definitive evidence for improvements in cost-effectiveness surround the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis, followed by the evaluation of abdominal trauma.

The objectives of this review are to (1) synthesize barriers and facilitators to implementing evidence-based guidelines in long-term care, as defined as a home where residents require 24-h nursing care, and 50% of the population is over the age of 65 years; and (2) map barriers and facilitators to the Behaviour Change Wheel framework to inform theory-guided knowledge translation strategies. METHODS: Following the guidance of the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group Guidance Series and the ENTREQ reporting guidelines, we systematically reviewed the reported experiences of long-term care staff on implementing evidence-based guidelines into practice. MEDLINE Pubmed, EMBASE Ovid, and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date available until May 2021. Two independent reviewers selected primary studies for inclusion if they were conducted in long-term care and reported the perspective or experiences of long-term care staff with implementing an evidence-based practice guideline about health conditions. Appraisal of the included studies was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist and confidence in the findings with the GRADE-CERQual approach. FINDINGS: After screening 2680 abstracts, we retrieved 115 full-text articles; 33 of these articles met the inclusion criteria. Barriers included time constraints and inadequate staffing, cost and lack of resources, and lack of teamwork and organizational support. Facilitators included leadership and champions, well-designed strategies, protocols, and resources, and adequate services, resources, and time. The most frequent Behaviour Change Wheel components were physical and social opportunity and psychological capability. We concluded moderate or high confidence in all but one of our review findings.

Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates.

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a flavonoid compound with several pharmacological properties, including free radical scavenging, antithrombotic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we investigated the anti-allergic inflammatory effects and the underlying molecular mechanism of DHM in the DNP-IgE-sensitized human mast cell line, KU812. The cytokine levels and mast cell degranulation assays were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The possible mechanism of the DHM-mediated anti-allergic signaling pathway was analyzed by western blotting. It was found that treatment with DHM suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6 in DNP-IgE-sensitized KU812 cells. The anti-allergic inflammatory properties of DHM were mediated by inhibition of NF-B activation. In addition, DHM suppressed the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and mast cell-derived tryptase production.

Extracellular Cyclophilin A is an emerging inflammatory mediator and metalloproteinase inducer, and the gene responsible for its expression has recently been linked to COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES Here we explore the involvement of extracellular Cyclophilin A in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury. METHODS Mice were ventilated with low or high tidal volume for up to 3 hours, with or without blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling, and lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Human primary alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to in vitro stretch to explore the cellular source of extracellular Cyclophilin A, and Cyclophilin A levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, to evaluate clinical relevance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS High tidal volume ventilation in mice provoked a rapid increase in soluble Cyclophilin A levels in the alveolar space, but not plasma. In vivo ventilation and in vitro stretch experiments indicated alveolar epithelium as the likely major source. In vivo blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling substantially attenuated physiological dysfunction, macrophage activation and matrix metalloproteinases. Finally, we found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome showed markedly elevated levels of extracellular Cyclophilin A within bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS Cyclophilin A is upregulated within the lungs of injuriously ventilated mice (and critically ill patients), where it plays a significant role in lung injury.

A vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of HCMV during pregnancy is necessary to reduce the incidence of infant disease. The glycoprotein B (gB) + MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine platform is the most successful HCMV vaccine tested to-date, demonstrating approximately 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV acquisition in phase II trials. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection remains unknown. Plasma from 33 gB/MF59 vaccinees at peak immunogenicity was tested for gB epitope specificity as well as neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-HCMV effector functions, and compared to an HCMV-seropositive cohort. gB/MF59 vaccination elicited IgG responses with gB-binding magnitude and avidity comparable to natural infection. Additionally, IgG subclass distribution was similar with predominant IgG1 and IgG3 responses induced by gB vaccination and HCMV infection. However, vaccine-elicited antibodies exhibited limited neutralization of the autologous virus, negligible neutralization of multiple heterologous strains, and limited binding responses against gB structural motifs targeted by neutralizing antibodies including AD-1, AD-2, and Domain I. Interestingly, vaccinees had high-magnitude IgG responses against AD-3 linear epitopes, demonstrating immunodominance against this non-neutralizing, cytosolic region. Finally, vaccine-elicited IgG robustly bound trimeric, membrane-associated gB on the surface of transfected or HCMV-infected cells and mediated virion phagocytosis, though were poor mediators of NK cell activation. Altogether, these data suggest that non-neutralizing antibody functions, including virion phagocytosis, likely played a role in the observed 50% vaccine-mediated protection against HCMV acquisition. The CDC estimates that every hour, a child is born in the United States with permanent neurologic disability resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection C more than is caused by Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. A maternal vaccine to block transmission of HCMV to the developing fetus is a necessary intervention to prevent these adverse outcomes. The gB/MF59 vaccine is the most successful tested clinically to-date, achieving 50% reduction in HCMV acquisition. This manuscript establishes the function and epitope specificity of the humoral response stimulated by this vaccine that may explain the partial vaccine efficacy. Understanding the mechanism of gB/MF59-elicited protective immune responses will guide rational design and evaluation of the next generation of HCMV vaccines.","output":"HCMV glycoprotein B subunit vaccine efficacy was mediated by non-neutralizing antibody effector functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As imaging technology plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), COVID-19 related data sets have been published one after another, but there are relatively few data sets and research progress in related literature.

Ultrasound can be performed directly at the bed-side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the disease among health professionals. Furthermore, it is a radiation-free exam, making it safer and easier to monitor those patients who require a series of exams. We report on four cases of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 who were monitored with lung ultrasound examination. All patients showed sonographic features indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B-lines) were observed in all four cases, and patchy areas of white lung were observed in two.

This study sought to understand the cost of nurse burnout-attributed turnover using hypothetical hospital scenarios. METHODS A cost-consequence analysis with a Markov model structure was used to assess nurse burnout-attributed turnover costs under the following scenarios: (1) a hospital with \\"status quo\\" nurse burnout prevalence and (2) a hospital with a \\"burnout reduction program\\" and decreased nurse burnout prevalence. The model evaluated turnover costs from a hospital payer perspective and modeled a cohort of nurses who were new to a hospital. The outcome measures were defined as years in burnout among the nurse cohort and years retained/employed in the hospital. Data inputs derived from the health services literature base. RESULTS The expected model results demonstrated that at status quo, a hospital spends an expected $16,736 per nurse per year employed on nurse burnout-attributed turnover costs. In a hospital with a burnout reduction program, such costs were $11,592 per nurse per year employed. Nurses spent more time in burnout under the status quo scenario compared with the burnout reduction scenario (1.5 versus 1.1 y of employment) as well as less time employed at the hospital (2.9 versus 3.5 y of employment).

Instead, it aims to identify the channels of transmissions into the food and agriculture sectors and, based on this, to delineate the degrees of exposure to the COVID-19- induced shock by geographic region. The initial aim was to examine all elements of the food system. However, data availability limited the empirical analysis largely to primary production, trade and final consumption. These elements are analyzed in detail and, where possible, quantified. Based on results of the analysis, a country taxonomy of the exposure is developed and presented. With 80 percent of countries, accounting for 92 percent of global GDP2, under social distancing provisions, labour availability for agricultural supply chains has become a near ubiquitous problem. In general, low-income countries employ higher shares of labour for primary production, which makes them more exposed to direct disruptions in labour supply, including the farmer's own labour force. The same holds for labour-intensive production more generally. Various examples illustrate that fruit and vegetable as well as meat or dairy production have already been adversely affected by COVID-induced labour shortages. Such deficits can be caused by domestic labour supply disruptions, as well as by shortages of seasonal and migrant workers. In addition, also macroeconomic channels of transmission affect agricultural supply, trade and final demand. The precipitous fall in oil and metal prices, for instance, exerted downward pressure on the exchange rates of many commodity exporting countries (commodity currencies). While the downward pressure on exchange rates, triggered by price declines in nonfood commodities, affects all tradeable commodities, including food. It makes food suppliesinternationally more competitive, at least in the short term, and supports exports of food. In response to these changes, some commodity exporters have started to impose export restrictions on food and agricultural products to avoid compromising domestic supplies. Finally, and arguably most importantly, COVID-19 will exert a shock on final food demand by lowering overall purchasing power, especially for an increasing number of unemployed people. The extent of the impacts on food demand will depend on numerous factors, including the depth and length of the macroeconomic shock, the availability of savings and access to credit and safetynet mechanisms.","output":"COVID-19: channels of transmission to food and agriculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid aptamers are short sequences of nucleic acid ligands that bind to a specific target molecule.

In contrast with much of the existing literature which assumes coefficients to evolve according to a random walk, a hierarchical mixture model on the TVPs is introduced. The resulting model closely mimics a random coefficients specification which groups the TVPs into several regimes. These flexible mixtures allow for TVPs that feature a small, moderate or large number of structural breaks. We develop computationally efficient Bayesian econometric methods based on the singular value decomposition of the KT regressors. In artificial data, we find our methods to be accurate and much faster than standard approaches in terms of computation time. In an empirical exercise involving inflation forecasting using a large number of predictors, we find our models to forecast better than alternative approaches and document different patterns of parameter change than are found with approaches which assume random walk evolution of parameters.","output":"Fast and Flexible Bayesian Inference in Time-varying Parameter Regression Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, many countries are considering the introduction of tracing software on mobile smartphones with the main purpose to inform and alarm the mobile app user.

In the United States, awareness about PrEP has steadily increased over time among individuals vulnerable to HIV, however awareness has not translated into widescale uptake. Estimates are that fewer than 20% of 1.2 million Americans for whom PrEP is indicated are utilizing it. We sought to understand how individuals moved from PrEP awareness to PrEP utilization. Methods: We conducted a series (n = 31) of in-depth interviews with young people, predominantly gay and bisexual men, ages 18-29 years old between February 2015 and January 2016, as part of the evaluation of a multi-year demonstration project funded to test innovative approaches to improve sexual health outcomes and curb the HIV epidemic in California. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We conducted a thematic analysis. Results: We present a continuum of PrEP awareness that spans three phases-basic, moderate and advanced. Participants rarely reported becoming well-informed about PrEP over the course of an initial exposure to PrEP information. Learning occurred after multiple exposures to PrEP information through numerous intersecting forms, messengers and formal and informal communication channels. Positively framed messages delivered by formal messengers emphasizing PrEP as a sensible HIV prevention strategy and explicitly communicating a regard for sexual wellness were overwhelmingly persuasive and facilitated movement to the advanced awareness phase. Once participants reached the advanced phase of PrEP awareness, uptake was possible. Conclusions: Our analysis provides insights into how PrEP awareness led to PrEP uptake among young gay and bi-sexual men. Building demand among those in the basic awareness phase took longer than those in the moderate phase. Individuals involved in formal and informal PrEP education can set reasonable expectations about whether, when and how eventual uptake may occur when keeping the continuum of PrEP awareness framework in mind. Many young, gay and bi-sexual male prospective PrEP users will benefit from positively framed messages that emphasize personal well-being, including social, sexual and emotional benefits of PrEP use.","output":"Exploring the Shift From HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Awareness to Uptake Among Young Gay and Bisexual Men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To identify dietary patterns during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine their association with changes in weight status in the Chinese population. Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 cross-sectional survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media across 31 provinces in mainland China between April and May 2020. Dietary data were assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire and the changes in weight status were self-reported. Exploratory factor analysis using the principal component analysis method was applied to identify dietary patterns. The multinomial regression models were conducted, and forest plots were used to present the associations between dietary patterns and changes in weight status. Results: Of a total of 10,545 adults (aged 18 years), more than half of participants reported to have weight gain, with 18.6% of men and 16.3% of women having weight gain >2.5 kg. Approximately 8% of participants reported to have weight loss, with 2.1% of men and 2.5% women having weight loss >2.5 kg. Two dietary patterns, namely, the modern and prudent dietary patterns, were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The modern dietary pattern was loaded heavily with soft drinks, fried foods, pickles, and inversely with fresh vegetables. The prudent dietary pattern was characterized by high intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, and inversely with soft drinks and fried food. The modern dietary pattern was positively associated with weight gain in men and women, while the prudent dietary pattern was negatively associated with both weight gain and loss in men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The average age of the patients was 61.8  14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50-79. The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients. Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients. Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment. In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver. Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered. Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered. The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients.

Methods A propensity-score-matched nationwide cohort study was performed in South Korea. Data obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea from all adult patients (age >20 years) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea between January 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020 were analyzed. The association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and allergic diseases in the entire cohort (n=219,959) and the difference of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with allergic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n=7340). Results In the entire cohort, patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing were evaluated to ascertain whether asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. After propensity score matching, we found that asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Patients with non-allergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 than patients with allergic asthma.

METHODS: The top 25% variance genes in the GSE21321 and GSE22255 datasets were analyzed for coexpression. The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRs) between patients with T2DM or ischemic stroke and controls were analyzed. Then, the union of overlapping coexpressed genes and overlapping DEmRs was analyzed. The miRNAs differentially expressed in T2DM-associated ischemic stroke were also analyzed. CIBERSORT was used to evaluate the levels of infiltration by immune cells in T2DM-associated stroke. RESULTS: Thirteen coexpression modules were identified in T2DM and 10 in ischemic stroke, and 594 module genes were shared between the two conditions. A total of 4452 mRNAs differentially expressed between T2DM patients and controls were identified, as were 2390 mRNAs differentially expressed between ischemic stroke and controls. The 771 union genes were enriched mainly in immune-related biological functions and signaling pathways. UBE2N, TGFB3, EXOSC1, and VIM were identified as candidate markers. In addition, we identified miR-576-3p as having the most regulatory roles in both T2DM and ischemic stroke.

Theoretical or empirical predictions for protein coacervates would enable the design of these coacervates with tunable and predictable structure-function relationships; unfortunately, no such theories exist. To help establish predictive models, the impact of protein-specific parameters on complex coacervation were probed in this study. The complex coacervation of sequence-specific, polypeptide-tagged, GFP variants and a strong synthetic polyelectrolyte was used to evaluate the effects of protein charge patterning on phase behavior. Phase portraits for the protein coacervates demonstrated that charge patterning dictates the protein's binodal phase boundary. Protein concentrations over 100 mg mL-1 were achieved in the coacervate phase, with concentrations dependent on the tag polypeptide sequence covalently attached to the globular protein domain. In addition to shifting the binodal phase boundary, polypeptide charge patterning provided entropic advantages over isotropically patterned proteins.

We further quantified the relative importance of spatial, environmental and biotic variables in explaining water-depth patterns in beta diversity. Based on the Baselga's framework, there was a taxonomic dependency for the patterns of beta diversity components with water-depth, showing a significant species turnover pattern for bacteria, while diatoms and chironomids showed significant nestedness. This dependency was also evident in the patterns of community uniqueness with water-depth because based on Legendre's framework, the LCBD decreased with water depth for bacteria whereas increased with depth for diatoms. The total beta diversity and species turnover of bacteria could be explained by the pure effects of spatial, environmental and biotic variables. A total of 26.8% and 23.6% of the nestedness component of diatoms and chironomids was explained by environmental variables, respectively, while species turnover was mostly related to spatial variables.

Possible associations of cytokine levels with patients age and gender, glucocorticosteroid therapy, as well as the trend of the inflammatory process at the time of sampling (increased or decreased) were also analyzed. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 23 COVID-19 patients and 17 healthy control subjects. The concentrations of selected Th1/Th2/Th9/Th17/Th22 cytokines were determined using a multi-analyte flow assay kit. RESULTS: Our results showed that peripheral blood cells from severely ill COVID-19 patients had a much reduced ability to produce cytokines in comparison to healthy controls. When inflammation was raised, blood cells produced more IL-6 and IL-17, which led to increases of some Th17/Th1 and Th17/Th2 ratios, skewing towards the Th17 type of response. The methylprednisolone used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 influences the production of several cytokines in dose dependent manner.

Due to unavailability of specific drugs, early detection of (COVID-19) patients is essential for disease cure and control. There is a vital need to detect the disease at early stage and instantly quarantine the infected people. Many research have been going on, however, none of them introduces satisfactory results yet. In spite of its simplicity, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has proven high flexibility in complex classification problems. However, it can be easily trapped. In this paper, a new COVID-19 diagnose strategy is introduced, which is called COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS). The novelty of CPDS is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new hybrid feature selection Methodology (HFSM), which elects the most informative features from those extracted from chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 peoples. HFSM is a hybrid methodology as it combines evidence from both wrapper and filter feature selection methods. It consists of two stages, namely; Fast Selection Stage (FS(2)) and Accurate Selection Stage (AS(2)). FS(2)relies on filter, while AS(2) uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a wrapper method. As a hybrid methodology, HFSM elects the significant features for the next detection phase. The second contribution is an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN) classifier, which avoids the trapping problem of the traditional KNN by adding solid heuristics in choosing the neighbors of the tested item. EKNN depends on measuring the degree of both closeness and strength of each neighbor of the tested item, then elects only the qualified neighbors for classification. Accordingly, EKNN can accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on those significant features selected by HFSM technique. Extensive experiments have been done considering the proposed detection strategy as well as recent competitive techniques on the chest CT images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed detection strategy outperforms recent techniques as it introduces the maximum accuracy rate.","output":"A new COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS) based on hybrid feature selection and enhanced KNN classifier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

CoVex integrates virus-human protein interactions, human protein-protein interactions, and drug-target interactions.

Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception to March 13, 2017, including studies that assessed basal vascular reactivity in two or more of the following health groups (aged 18 years old): healthy, overweight, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes with or without complications. Direct and indirect comparisons of vascular reactivity were combined using a network meta-analysis. Comparing data from 193 articles (7226 healthy subjects and 19344 patients), the network meta-analyses revealed a progressive impairment in vascular reactivity (flow-mediated dilation data) from the clinical onset of an overweight status (-0.41%, 95% CI, -0.98 to 0.15) through to the development of vascular complications in those with type 2 diabetes (-4.26%, 95% CI, -4.97 to -3.54). Meta-regressions revealed that for every 1 mmol/l increase in fasting blood glucose concentration, flow-mediated dilation decreased by 0.52%. Acknowledging that the time course of disease may vary between patients, this study demonstrates multiple continuums of vascular dysfunction where the severity of impairment in vascular reactivity progressively increases throughout the pathogenesis of obesity and/or insulin resistance, providing information that is important to enhancing the timing and effectiveness of strategies that aim to improve cardiovascular outcomes.","output":"The continuums of impairment in vascular reactivity across the spectrum of cardiometabolic health: A systematic review and network meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Procuring respiratory protection for clinicians and other health care workers has become a major challenge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has resulted in nonstandard practices such as the use of expired respirators and various decontamination processes to prolong the useful life of respirators in health care settings. In addition, imported, non-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators have been donated or acquired by hospitals as a potential replacement for limited NIOSH-approved N95 respirators. Objective: To assess fitted filtration efficiencies (FFEs) for face mask alternatives used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this quality-improvement study conducted between April and June 2020, we used the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol for Filtering Facepiece Respirators in a laboratory atmosphere supplemented with sodium chloride particles to assess the FFEs of a variety of respirators worn by a male volunteer and female volunteer. Main Outcomes and Measures: The FFEs of respirators commonly worn by clinicians and other health care workers and available respirator alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 29 different fitted face mask alternatives tested on 1 man and 1 woman, expired N95 respirators with intact elastic straps and respirators subjected to ethylene oxide and hydrogen peroxide sterilization had unchanged FFE (>95%). The performance of N95 respirators in the wrong size had slightly decreased performance (90%-95% FFE). All of the respirators not listed as approved in this evaluation (n = 6) failed to achieve 95% FFE. Neither of the 2 imported respirators authorized for use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were not NIOSH-approved tested in this study achieved 95% FFE, and the more effective of the 2 functioned at approximately 80% FFE. Surgical and procedural face masks had filtering performance that was lower relative to that of N95 respirators (98.5% overall FFE), with procedural face masks secured with elastic ear loops showing the lowest efficiency (38.1% overall FFE). Conclusions and Relevance: This quality-improvement study evaluating 29 face mask alternatives for use by clinicians interacting with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic found that expired N95 respirators and sterilized, used N95 respirators can be used when new N95 respirators are not available. Other alternatives may provide less effective filtration.","output":"Filtration Efficiency of Hospital Face Mask Alternatives Available for Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Daten sind der Inhalt von Geschichten.

CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During March-April of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm. METHODS: Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86-329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1-328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived. CONCLUSION: HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","output":"The COVID-19 Epidemic: Management and Outcomes of Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients in Stockholm, Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Garlic is a plant has been used as a flavor, and anti-microbial and anti-diarrheal agent.

This was accomplished by measuring indicators of lumbar motor control, specifically lumbar spinal stiffness, activity of lumbar extensor and flexor muscles and lumbar curvature, in hypergravity and microgravity during parabolic flights. Three female and five male subjects participated in this study. The mean age was 35.5 years (standard deviation: 8.5 years). Spinal stiffness of the L3 vertebra was measured using impulse response; activity of the erector spinae, multifidi, transversus abdominis, and psoas muscles was recorded using surface electromyography; and lumbar curvature was measured using distance sensors mounted on the back-plate of a full-body harness. An effect of gravity condition on spinal stiffness, activity of all muscles assessed and lumbar curvature (p's < 0.007) was observed (Friedman tests). Post hoc analysis showed a significant reduction in stiffness during hypergravity (p < 0.001) and an increase in stiffness during microgravity (p < 0.001). Activity in all muscles significantly increased during hypergravity (p's < 0.001). During microgravity, the multifidi (p < 0.002) and transversus abdominis (p < 0.001) increased significantly in muscle activity while no significant difference was found for the psoas (p = 0.850) and erector spinae muscles (p = 0.813). Lumbar curvature flattened in hypergravity as well as microgravity, albeit in different ways: during hypergravity, the distance to the skin decreased for the upper (p = 0.016) and the lower sensor (p = 0.036). During microgravity, the upper sensor showed a significant increase (p = 0.016), and the lower showed a decrease (p = 0.005) in distance. This study emphasizes the role of spinal motor control adaptations in changing gravity conditions. Both hypergravity and microgravity lead to changes in spinal motor control. The decrease in spinal stiffness during hypergravity is interpreted as a shift of the axial load from the spine to the pelvis and thoracic cage. In microgravity, activity of the multifidi and of the psoas muscles seems to ensure the integrity of the spine.

Most studies published so far have primarily focused on a group of HEI workers' (i.e., teachers and researchers), but not on staff members, despite their crucial role for HEI functioning. Following the Job Demands-Resources theory, we aimed to: (i) characterize work-life conflict (WLC) among men and women workers from an HEI (staff and teachers/researchers) during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) explore the major predictors of WLC for both staff and teachers/researchers. This study includes a sample of 262 workers from one Portuguese HEI (n = 128 staff members; n = 134 teachers/researchers) who answered an online survey. An Independent Samples T-Test showed that the reported current WLC was significantly higher for teachers/researchers compared to staff. Moreover, women teachers/researchers showed higher WLC than men. Additionally, using a Repeated Measures ANOVA, we found that the increase in the reported levels of WLC (before the pandemic and currently) was significantly more prominent among teachers/researchers than in the staff group. Regarding the predictors of WLC for both groups separately, a Multiple Hierarchical Linear Regression showed that role overload, conceptualized as a demand, was a predictor for both staff and teachers/researchers. As for potential resources, work dedication negatively predicted WLC for staff, whereas family-friendly organization perceptions predicted less WLC for teachers/researchers. These results highlight the importance of understanding HEIs holistically, by considering workers' individual characteristics such as gender, but also distinct careers inside the institutions. As most European HEIs are currently making active efforts to promote gender-equal academic workplaces, these findings may help them design tailored and effective measures to address employees' work-life balance issues, not only considering gender, but also the different types of demands associated with each group of workers within HEIs.","output":"Work-Life Conflict Among Higher Education Institution Workers' During COVID-19: A Demands-Resources Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT This research paper makes an empirical analysis based on long memory to understand the historical behavior of initial unemployment claims (ICSA) in the United States (U S ) during all the recession periods and epidemic diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 since 1967 applying statistical methods based on long range dependence and fractional differentiation Using unit root/stationarity tests (ADF, PP and KPSS) we discover that the original time series is stationary I(0) and the subsamples are non-stationary I(1) Finally, to analyze the original time series as well as the several periods corresponding to the recessions that occurred in U S and the three epidemic diseases, we use AIC and BIC criterion to fit the best ARFIMA model We conclude that the results display long memory with a degree of integration strictly below 1 (d &lt; 1) for the COVID-19 episode and for the rest of the subsamples, except for the original time series and the 2nd subsample Thus we can conclude that the impacts will be transient and with long lasting effects of shocks and expecting to disappear on their own in long term Finally, we use a methodology proposed by Bai and Perron to estimate structural breaks not being necessary to know the time of the breaks in advance The results are similar to those obtained previously","output":"U.S. historical initial jobless claims.

Gene expression comparisons revealed that healthy NK cells have an active NK cell molecular phenotype, whereas tumor-exposed (teNK) cells resemble resting NK cells. ReceptorCligand analysis between teNK cells and tumor cells revealed multiple potential targets.

Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We introduce the concept of non-technical skill acquisition in microsurgical training with the use of living laboratory animals in the context of a novel proposed curriculum. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed/Medline and Scopus within the past 11 years based on a combination of the following keywords: microsurgery, training, skills, and models.

RESULTS: Living models offer the chance to develop both technical and non-technical competencies (i.e., leadership, situation awareness, decision-making, communication, and teamwork). Prior experience with ex vivo tissues helps residents consolidate basic skills prior to performing more advanced techniques in the living tissues. Trainees reported a higher satisfaction rate with the living models.

Almost every sector of human-beings and their related activities are severely infected and affected by this COVID-19 pandemic. As days are passing, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is going to be more severe. The fundamental needs for personal protective equipment (PPEs) are rising drastically all over the world.

To quantify the uncertainties among parameter values, we have taken advantage of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. A robust ranking function is presented to obtain a crisp version of it. Furthermore, a novel interactive intuitionistic fuzzy programming approach is developed to solve the proposed SPWM model. An ample opportunity to generate the desired solution sets are also depicted. The performance analysis based on multiple criteria such as savings from baseline, co-efficient of variations, and desirability degrees is also introduced. Practical managerial implications are also discussed based on the significant findings after applying to the real case study data-set.

They have also performed well during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for a quick reorganization of care and continued provision of mental health services. Some of the key innovations of the new model include the introduction of recovery assistants (a new profession) and mental health coordinators (a new role);liaison with social assistance services;and a shift to budget financing. The key obstacles to the national rollout of mental health centres are the low financing of mental health care in Poland, which is among the lowest in Europe, and acute workforce shortages.","output":"Implementation of Mental Health Centres Pilots in Poland since 2018: A Chance to Move towards Community-Based Mental Health Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies exploring the longer-term effects of experiencing COVID-19 infection on mental health are lacking.

Recently, the endogenous cannabinoid system has emerged as a hot topic in the study of opioid reward but relatively little is known about how repeated opioid exposure may affect the endogenous cannabinoid system in the mesolimbic reward circuitry. In the present study, we investigated how sustained morphine may modulate the endogenous cannabinoid system in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Sprague Dawley rats, a critical region in the mesolimbic reward circuitry. Studies here using proteomic analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) found that the VTA expresses 32 different proteins or genes related to the endogenous cannabinoid system; three of these proteins or genes (PLC2, ABHD6, and CB2R) were significantly affected after repeated morphine exposure (CB2R was only detected by qRT-PCR but not proteomics). We also identified that repeated morphine treatment does not alter either anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels in the VTA compared to saline treatment; however, there may be diminished levels of anandamide (AEA) production in the VTA 4 h after a single morphine injection in both chronic saline and morphine pretreated cohorts. Treating the animals with an inhibitor of 2-AG degradation significantly decreased repeated opioid rewarding behavior. Taken together, our studies reveal a potential influence of sustained opioids on the endocannabinoid system in the VTA, suggesting that the endogenous cannabinoid system may participate in the opioid-induced reward.","output":"The Effects of Repeated Morphine Treatment on the Endogenous Cannabinoid System in the Ventral Tegmental Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new disease, so we dont know what comes next. Since information on delayed symptoms is limited, this study was conducted to assess the frequency of delayed symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This follow-up cross-sectional study was conducted in a referral general hospital in Tehran, Iran from Feb to Apr 2020. Two hundred patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and were discharged were assessed for delayed symptoms 6 wk after discharge. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 55.5813.52, and 160 (80%) Of them were male. On admission to hospital, patients reported a mean of 5.632.88 symptoms per patient, range from 1 to 14 symptoms. Dyspnea was seen in 119 (59.5%) 0f them as the most frequent symptom. Then weakness, myalgia, and shivering were reported with a frequency of 111 (55.5%), 107 (53.5%), and 103 (51.5%), respectively. Six weeks after discharge reassessment was done.

Sex and gender-based differences in lung infection are recognized and gradually gaining importance due to the potential for gender-tailored therapeutics. While sex and gender differences are widely acknowledged in the evaluation of chronic respiratory disease states such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), acute and chronic respiratory infection complicate all of these and, in themselves, depending on age and organism, demonstrate sex differences. Males are disadvantaged in the occurrence and severity of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, while females suffer more commonly with upper respiratory tract ailments including tonsillitis and sinusitis. Differences in genetics and immunity have been forwarded as explanations for such differences; however, it is likely that a complex interplay of sex steroid hormones, host immunity, genetics, anatomical variation, and lung physiology, in addition to sociocultural and behavioral factors, influences the observed sex differences in respiratory infection.

Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor that has been proposed as a therapy for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. It is possible that the immunomodulatory effects of tocilizumab may also have the unintended consequence of predisposing to secondary infections. We sought to assess the risk of invasive fungal disease and therapeutic impact of tocilizumab on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. MethodsRecords of critically-ill patients with COVID-19 over a 6 month period at our institution were reviewed, and medical histories, treatments, and clinical outcomes were extracted. The incidence of fungal infections in those that received tocilizumab in addition to standard COVID-19 treatments was assessed. ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital LOS were compared between treatment groups. ResultsOne-hundred and thirty patients were identified, of which 56 met inclusion criteria. 16 patients received tocilizumab, and 40 did not. Invasive fungal infections occurred in 10.7% of all patients. Infection rates were significantly higher in the tocilizumab group than in the control group (31.2% v 2.5%, RR 12.5, p&lt;0.01). There was a strong dose-response relation for tocilizumab, with 2.5% of events occurring with 0 doses, 20% with a single dose, and 50% with 2 doses (M-H OR 39, p&lt;0.01).

A comprehensive characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between SARS-CoV-2 and human cells is a key to understanding the infection and preventing the disease. Here we present a novel approach to predict virus-host PPIs by multi-label machine learning classifiers of random forests and XGBoost using amino acid composition profiles of virus and human proteins. Our models harness a large-scale database of Viruses.STRING with >80,000 virus-host PPIs along with evidence scores for multi-level evidence prediction, which is distinct from predicting binary interactions in previous studies. Our multi-label classifiers are based on 5 evidence levels binned from evidence scores. Our best model of XGBoost achieves 74% AUC and 68% accuracy on average in 10-fold cross validation. The most important amino acids are cysteine and histidine. In addition, our model predicts experimental PPIs with higher evidence level than text mining-based PPIs. We then predict evidence levels of ~2,000 SARS-CoV-2 virus-human PPIs from public experimental proteomics data. Interactions with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7b show high evidence. We also predict evidence levels of all pairwise PPIs of ~550,000 between the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes to provide a draft virus-host interactome landscape for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans in a comprehensive and unbiased way in silico. Most human proteins from 140 highest evidence predictions interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7, Nsp1, and ORF14, with significant enrichment in the top 2 pathways of vascular smooth muscle contraction (CALD1, NPR2, CALML3) and Myc targets (CBX3, PES1).

This is partly due to policies and practices led by those who were less familiar and comfortable with using new technologies. Younger physicians will drive technological advancement and integration faster than previous generations, allowing technology to adapt more quickly to serve the needs of clinicians and patients. These changes will improve efficiency, allow more flexible working arrangements, and increase convenience for patients and physicians.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected using a priori inclusion criteria of sensory and cognitive disabilities and focused on consent/assent strategies and processes in research within this population. Articles related to the medical or sexual consent processes were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: An Excel spreadsheet was used to extract data from the eligible sources. Discrepancies were resolved in discussion with team members. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 2163 sources were screened, and 16 articles were included in the review. Seven sources only examined consent strategies, whereas the remaining 8 included a combination of consent/assent and dissent strategies. Using thematic analysis, 3 key themes emerged: consent/assent strategies, researcher capacity, and capacity to consent tools. Key identified strategies included the accessibility of the consent/assent process, building relationships with participants and caregivers, identifying behavioral cues, and communication training for researchers.

SettingCommunity dispensed CVD medications with 100% coverage from England, Scotland and Wales, plus primary care prescribed CVD medications from England (including 98% English general practices). Participants15.8 million individuals aged 18+ years alive on 1st April 2018 dispensed at least one CVD medicine in a year from England, Scotland and Wales. Main outcome measuresMonthly counts, percent annual change (1st April 2018 to 31st July 2021) and annual rates (1st March 2018 to 28th February 2021) of medicines dispensed by CVD/ CVD risk factor; prevalent and incident use. ResultsYear-on-year change in dispensed CVD medicines by month were observed, with notable uplifts ahead of the first (11.8% higher in March 2020) but not subsequent national lockdowns. Using hypertension as one example of the indirect impact of the pandemic, we observed 491,203 fewer individuals initiated antihypertensive treatment across England, Scotland and Wales during the period March 2020 to end May 2021 than would have been expected compared to 2019. We estimated that this missed antihypertension treatment could result in 13,659 additional CVD events should individuals remain untreated, including 2,281 additional myocardial infarctions (MIs) and 3,474 additional strokes. Incident use of lipid-lowering medicines decreased by an average 14,793 per month in early 2021 compared with the equivalent months prior to the pandemic in 2019.

We aimed to explore the impact of point-of-care chest ultrasound (CUS) use in older bedridden inpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool to distinguish between cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and isolated viral pneumonia-related dyspnoea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective series included 16 patients aged 75 or older, hospitalized for acute dyspnoea in an acute geriatric unit of a university hospital and testing positive for a SARS-Cov2 infection. We collected demographic characteristics, medical history, biological screening, clinical symptoms, CUS findings (n = 16) and chest CT-scan conclusions (n = 14). Mean age was 89 years (77-97). All patients presented asthenia and dyspnoea, 56% complained of coughing and diarrhoea, and 50% had fever. Acute heart failure was clinically suspected in seven patients. At CUS, evidence of heart failure was confirmed in three patients (including one without clinical suspicion); interstitial syndrome was confirmed in 12 patients on CUS vs. 9 patients with CT. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with COVID-19 and acute dyspnoea, the use of point-of-care CUS allowed the clinician to quickly rule out heart failure in nearly half of suspected cases while easily identifying virus-related interstitial syndrome.

Details of SCPRT, LCCRT and both minor and major wound complications were identified by retrospective notes review. RESULTS Of 74 patients suitable for analysis, 38 (51%) had recorded wound complications, with 23 (31%) having major wound complications. 43 patients (58%) underwent LCCRT and 11 (15%) SCPRT. Overall wound complications were more common in the LCCRT group than those receiving no treatment (58% vs 30%, p = 0.03), and major wound complications more common after SCPRT than LCCRT (45% vs 35%, p = 0.04) or no treatment (45% vs 10%, p = 0.04). Use of mesh led to more wound complications (71% vs 41%), but almost all of these patients received LCCRT. CONCLUSIONS Pre-operative LCCRT and SCPRT are both associated with increased perineal wound complications after APER.","output":"Does pre-operative chemoradiotherapy cause wound complications after abdominoperineal excision for rectal cancer?

Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel testing of GenMark Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA, USA) with regard to time to result, installed isolation precautions, and antibacterial/antiviral treatment. Between January and March 2017, 68 specimens of 64 patients suspected of an acute respiratory infection were tested with LDT and the ePlex? RP panel.

This study was set up to gain insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the core competencies of general practice, as they are experienced by general practitioners (GPs) on the frontline. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We performed a descriptive study using semistructured interviews with 132 GPs in Flanders, using a topic list based on the WONCA definition of core competencies in general practice. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. RESULTS: Changes in practice management and in consultation strategies were quickly adopted. There was a major switch towards telephone triage and consults, for covid-related as well as for non-covid related problems. Patient-centred care is still a major objective. Clinical decision-making is largely focused on respiratory assessment and triage, and GPs feel that acute care is compromised, both by their own changed focus and by the fact that patients consult less frequently for non-covid problems. Chronic care is mostly postponed, and this will have consequences that will extend and become visible after the corona crisis. Through the holistic eyes of primary care, the current outbreak-as well as the measures taken to control it-will have a profound impact on psychological and socioeconomic well-being. This impact is already visible in vulnerable people and will continue to become clear in the medium and long terms. GPs think that they are at high risk of getting infected. Dropping out and being unable to contribute their part or becoming virus transmitters are reported to be greater concerns than getting ill themselves. CONCLUSIONS: The current times have a profound impact on the core competences of primary care. Although the vast increase in patients soliciting medical help and the necessary separate covid and non-covid flows have been dealt with, GPs are worried about the continuity of regular care and the consequences of the anticovid measures. These may become a threat for the general health of the population and for the provision of primary healthcare in the near and distant future.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the core functions of primary care: will the cure be worse than the disease?

In the race to mitigate these effects, the UK government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. Transport provides the largest single sector contribution to CO(2) emissions, the road network accounts for up to 91%. As the only UK country without a formal climate change bill Northern Ireland could compromise the overall effort. CASE DESCRIPTION: In this research a survey of road asset owners, managers, academics, consultants, public transport providers was undertaken to seek to understand the current barriers to adapting a dispersed rural road network in Northern Ireland for net-zero transport. The survey data was collected though an online form with a combination of multiple choice and open ended questions. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the data collected which enabled a discussion around the key expert opinions gathered. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The paper presents details of the current road network in Northern Ireland and highlights some of the issues faced by asset owners. The survey questions were developed though engagement with transport professionals in Northern Ireland and focus predominantly on road use rather than the impact of current land management practices or environmental conditions such as flood risk. The response highlights a clear enthusiasm for change in the operation of the public road network which is hindered by a lack of government strategy and limited public consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The high response rate (41%) for the survey highlights the interest of those in the transport sector to engage in activities which can support a better understanding of how road networks contribute to CO(2) emissions. Within the survey data a requirement for behavioural change was highlighted as a key step to reduce transport related emissions, the enthusiasm for change demonstrates this is the optimum time to engage with the public and develop clear transport strategies. More accurate findings and empirical evidence could have been established had the study considered specific, transport planning, environmental and land use conditions for Northern Ireland. This will be the focus of further research in this area to enable clear translation of the research to other countries.","output":"Understanding the barriers to NET-ZERO transport for rural roads: a Northern Ireland case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context, especially in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a fraction q of shared individuals (overlap) We model the interactions through weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered);weights represent the contact times of the interactions Using branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers We find that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic can be prevented, increase with the overlap q Also we study the effect of the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system In addition, we find that for relatively small values of the overlap q, social distancing policies might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system","output":"Disease spreading with social distancing: A prevention strategy in disordered multiplex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite huge efforts towards understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pathogenesis, little is known about the long\\\\term consequences of the disease.

Willow bark (Salix cortex) has been used for centuries to relieve pain, inflammation, and fever. Its main active ingredient, salicin, is metabolized in the human body into salicylic acid, the precursor of the commonly used pain drug acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Here, we report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy of two methanolic Salix extracts, standardized to phenolic compounds, in comparison to ASA in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 peptide challenge. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptide/IL-1- or LPS-activated human PBMCs and an inflammatory intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture, Salix extracts, and ASA concentration-dependently suppressed prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), a principal mediator of inflammation. The inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity, but not protein expression was observed for ASA and one Salix extract. In activated PBMCs, the suppression of relevant cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1, and IL-10) was seen for both Salix extracts. The anti-inflammatory capacity of Salix extracts was still retained after transepithelial passage and liver cell metabolism in an advanced co-culture model system consisting of intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells and differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells.

In particular, middle-aged women may have physical and mental health problems, and participating in square dance may increase womens positive subjective well-being and decrease their negative emotions, which may improve their health over the long term. In addition, participating in square dance can promote group cohesion. Our study aimed to examine the relationship between the subjective exercise experience of participating in square dance and group cohesion and whether some variables (e.g., age, education, duration, income level, and work) play a role as mediators in the association with subjective exercise experience and group cohesion. Methods: In total, 1,468 Chinese women from 31 provinces and 82 cities participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a subjective exercise experience questionnaire and a group environment questionnaire. We analyzed the collected data and built a statistical model. Results: (a) Square dance satisfied womens physical and psychological needs partly; (b) positive well-being (PWB) was positively correlated with group cohesion, and fatigue was negatively correlated with group cohesion; and (c) the income level was a partial mediator of the relationship between group cohesion and subjective exercise experience. Conclusion: Chinese women have different motivations for participating in square dance. Because this activity can help meet womens physical and psychological needs, an increasing number of individuals worldwide participate in square dance.

While demodicosis is clearly the result of Demodex mite infestation, the pathogenicity of rosacea is still not sufficiently explained, so that it is defined by its symptoms, and not by its cause. It is usually considered as a disease of the immune system associated with neurogenic inflammation triggered by various factors (ultraviolet light, heat, spicy food, alcohol, stress, microorganisms). Its links with demodicosis remain controversial, although there is increasing evidence that Demodex mites may play a key role in the inflammatory process. Indeed, high Demodex densities are observed in nearly all cases of rosacea with papulopustules (PPR) and the papulopustules of rosacea can be effectively treated with topical acaricidal agents. Recent studies suggest that Demodex induces two opposite actions on host immunity: a defensive immune response aimed at eliminating the mite and an immunosuppressive action aimed at favoring its own proliferation. Moreover, the initial defensive immune response is likely diverted towards benefit for the mite, via T-cell exhaustion induced by the immunosuppressive properties of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may also explain the favorable influence that the altered vascular background of rosacea seems to exert on Demodex proliferation. In this review, the evidence for and against a causal role of Demodex in rosacea is discussed, applying three systems traditionally used to attribute causality to a disease (modified Koch criteria, Hill criteria for causality, Rothman model). The findings suggest that PPR can reasonably be attributed to Demodex proliferation, which appears to be a necessary factor in the center of a causal network in which multiple co-factors interact and influence the occurrence and severity of inflammatory symptoms, from limited (pityriasis folliculorum) to more marked (PPR). PPR could therefore be considered as a chronic infection by Demodex mites with associated T-cell exhaustion.","output":"Rosacea, an infectious disease: why rosacea with papulopustules should be considered a demodicosis.

RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups). No patient required hospitalization and no adrenal crisis was reported. Few nasopharyngeal swabs were performed (n=12) as indicated by sanitary regulations, limiting conclusions on the exact infection rate (two positive results in AI and none in controls, p 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: AI patients who are adequately treated and trained, seem to display the same incidence of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and disease severity as controls.","output":"Adrenal Insufficiency at the Time of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study in Patients Referring to a Tertiary Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Before the widespread implementation of robotic systems to provide patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic occurs, it is important to understand the acceptability of these systems among patients and the economic consequences associated with the adoption of robotics in health care settings. Objective: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study included 2 components: a national survey to examine the acceptability of using robotic systems to perform health care tasks in a hospital setting and a single-site cohort study of patient experiences and satisfaction with the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate triage and telehealth tasks in the emergency department (ED). The national survey comprised individuals living in the US who participated in a sampling-based survey via an online analytic platform. Participants completed the national survey between August 18 and August 21, 2020. The single-site cohort study included patients living in the US who presented to the ED of a large urban academic hospital providing quaternary care in Boston, Massachusetts between April and August 2020. All data were analyzed from August to October 2020. Exposures: Participants in the national survey completed an online survey to measure the acceptability of using a mobile robotic system to perform health care tasks (facilitating telehealth interviews, acquiring vital signs, obtaining nasal or oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, performing phlebotomy, and turning a patient in bed) in a hospital setting in the contexts of general interaction and interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in the cohort study were exposed to a mobile robotic system, which was controlled by an ED clinician and used to facilitate a triage interview. After exposure, patients completed an assessment to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Acceptability of the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks in a hospital setting (national survey) and feasibility and patient satisfaction regarding the use of a mobile robotic system in the ED (cohort study). Results: For the national survey, 1154 participants completed all acceptability questions, representing a participation rate of 35%. After sample matching, a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [17.0] years; 535 women [53.5%]) was included in the analysis. With regard to the usefulness of a robotic system to perform specific health care tasks, the response of \\"somewhat useful\\" was selected by 373 participants (37.3%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 350 participants (35.0%) for acquiring vital signs, 307 participants (30.7%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 228 participants (22.8%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 249 participants (24.9%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. The response of \\"extremely useful\\" was selected by 287 participants (28.7%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 413 participants (41.3%) for acquiring vital signs, 192 participants (19.2%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 159 participants (15.9%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 167 participants (16.7%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of individuals who perceived the application of robotic systems to be acceptable for completing telehealth interviews, obtaining nasal and oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, and performing phlebotomy increased. For the ED cohort study, 51 individuals were invited to participate, and 41 participants (80.4%) enrolled. One participant was unable to complete the study procedures because of a signaling malfunction in the robotic system. Forty patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [2.7] years; 29 women [72.5%]) completed the mobile robotic system-facilitated triage interview, and 37 patients (92.5%) reported that the interaction was satisfactory. A total of 33 participants (82.5%) reported that their experience of receiving an interview facilitated by a mobile robotic system was as satisfactory as receiving an in-person interview from a clinician. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a mobile robotic system was perceived to be acceptable for use in a broad set of health care tasks among survey respondents across the US. The use of a mobile robotic system enabled the facilitation of contactless triage interviews of patients in the ED and was considered acceptable among participants. Most patients in the ED rated the quality of mobile robotic system-facilitated interaction to be equivalent to in-person interaction with a clinician.","output":"Assessment of the Acceptability and Feasibility of Using Mobile Robotic Systems for Patient Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mortality in acute respiratory failure remains high despite the use of lung-protective ventilation. Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: In this registry-based, prospective cohort study, we obtained data from the Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry, which includes all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 4 h or more in nine ICUs that are affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada). We included all adult (&#8805;18 years) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation between April 11, 2014, and June 5, 2019. Patients were excluded if they received treatment with extracorporeal life support. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Bayesian joint models were used to estimate the strength of associations, accounting for informative censoring due to death during follow-up. FINDINGS: Of 13a939 patients recorded in the registry, 13a408 (962%) were eligible for descriptive analysis. The primary analysis comprised 7876 (587%) patients with complete baseline characteristics, and a secondary analysis included all 13a408 patients after multiple imputation in the joint model analysis. 2409 (180%) of 13a408 patients died in the ICU. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including age and severity of illness, a significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each daily increment in driving pressure (hazard ratio 1064, 95% credible interval 1057-1071) or mechanical power (hazard ratio 1060, 95% credible interval 1053-1066). These associations persisted over the duration of mechanical ventilation. INTERPRETATION: Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of mechanical ventilation was harmful, even for short durations. Limiting exposure to driving pressure or mechanical power should be evaluated in further studies as promising ventilation strategies to reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

Most of the startups have experienced a downturn in demand and supply due to COVID-19 led disturbances in sourcing networks. This paper aims to identify, analyze and categorize the significant risks influencing sourcing operations in startups during the COVID-19 era in India, using the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) approach. Design/methodology/approach: Eight enablers were identified through literature review and expert opinions from various startups in India. This study adopted the TISM approach to analyze the inter-relationships between the enablers. Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank the sourcing risk enablers and classify them as autonomous, independent, linkage and dependent enablers. Findings: The results indicate insufficient fund as the most critical enabler. Network issues and employee flexibility risk were among the other critical enablers that have a high driving power. Supplier risk, quality risk and demand risk were found to have highly dependent on other enablers for implementation. Research limitations/implications: This study mainly focuses on the sourcing risks in startup operations in India. This study can be extended to many other countries. Practical implications: This study will help startup industry managers and practitioners understand the interactions of enablers and identify critical enablers to mitigate risks in startup sourcing operations in the COVID-19 era.

He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents. The developmental pediatrician continued to modify the medication regimen over the summer, transitioning Brian from guanfacine to clonidine and increasing his aripiprazole incrementally (with clear increased benefit); hydroxyzine was also used as needed during the episodes of highest intensity.Despite the availability of best-practice guidelines for children with Brian's presenting concerns, a confluence of barriers (geographic, economic, ABA work force, global pandemic, etc.) present serious questions for his family and care team related to the next steps in Brian's care. Should he attend in-person school in the fall, knowing that the available program may have limited educational benefit and increase his risk of COVID-19 exposure (not to mention self-injury)?

Therefore, they may be inadequate if the observed response variable follows an asymmetrical distribution, such as CFR data. In addition, beta regression models do not consider the effect of the covariates across the spectrum of the dependent variable, which is possible through the conditional quantile approach. In order to introduce the proposed GB3 regression model, we first reparameterize the GB3 distribution by inserting a quantile parameter and then we develop the new proposed quantile model. We also propose a simple interpretation of the predictor-response relationship in terms of percentage increases/decreases of the quantile.

The antiplatelet effects of GBE50, aspirin and 1:1 combination of GBE50 and aspirin were detected by microplate method using rabbit platelets. Synergy finder 2.0 was used to analyze the synergistic antiplatelet effect. The compounds in GBE50 were identified by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS analysis and the candidate compounds were screened by TCMSP database. The targets of candidate compounds and aspirin were obtained in TCMSP, CCGs, Swiss target prediction database and drugbank. Targets involving platelet aggregation were obtained from GenCLiP database. Compound-target network was constructed and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to identify the critical biological processes and signaling pathways. The levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and PAF receptor (PAFR) were detected by ELISA to determine the effects of GBE50, aspirin and their combination on these pathways. RESULTS: GBE50 combined with aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation more effectively. The combination displayed synergistic antiplatelet effects in AA-induced platelet aggregation, and additive antiplatelet effects occurred in PAF, ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation. Seven compounds were identified as candidate compounds in GBE50. Enrichment analyses revealed that GBE50 could interfere with platelet aggregation via cAMP pathway, AA metabolism and calcium signaling pathway, and aspirin could regulate platelet aggregation through AA metabolism and platelet activation. ELISA experiments showed that GBE50 combined with aspirin could increase cAMP levels in resting platelets, and decreased the levels of TXB2 and PAFR.

Here we assess ten available HCV protease inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro and HCV NS3/4A proteases, and virtual docking experiments show that all ten HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro binding cleft. Seven of these HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity, while four dock well into the PLpro substrate binding cleft and inhibit PLpro protease activity. These same seven HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells, demonstrating that HCV drugs that inhibit Mpro, or both Mpro and PLpro, suppress virus replication. Two HCV drugs, simeprevir and grazoprevir synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, thereby increasing remdesivir inhibitory activity as much as 10-fold.

Moreover, COVID-19 has definitely put the spotlight on social inequalities that are underpinning our society and it has highlighted the escalation of the state surveillance capability and new forms of oppression too. The discrimination ingrained in our societies, built on a historically defined regime of racialized oppression and structural disadvantage of racialized citizens and migrants, was produced well before the coronavirus, but it is now casting a different shade, reinforcing forms of exclusions, highlighting the pandemic as a political issue. Hence, this paper addresses a range of political perspectives of the lived experiences in and through social space with examples of narratives in language which capture the everyday political experiences of the pandemic within Europe. The kind of language used and its profound effect on the growing discourse regarding COVID-19 is the main focus in this paper. I here explore the intertwining of language and politics during the pandemic and bring out the countervailing narratives that seem to be in constant tension. I then ask where this takes us, not only in terms of scholarship and expansion of knowledge, but also with a pragmatic edge to it, trying to figure out how is it possible for us to achieve some sort of cognitive shift in our approach in order to learn from this challenge and from this new perspective. Methodologically, as well as looking at existing data, references to attitudes in general are made. A theoretical discussion on migration and language, and the kind of intersection between them, is offered, from the point of view of critical theory, before pointing to the metaphors used, the implications they allow, and how all these fit together, in the form of a concluding discussion.

In 1996, the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre (TSRCC) initiated a Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) to provide timely palliative RT for symptom relief of patients with terminal cancer. PURPOSE This study reviews the clinical activity of the RRRP over the past 8 years to evaluate if we are meeting the objectives of the program. MATERIALS AND METHODS From the TSRCC oncology patient information system (OPIS) database, we retrieved the number of patients referred to the RRRP, their demographics, diagnosis and treatment for the calendar years 1996 to 2003 inclusive. We calculated the time interval between referral to consultation, consultation to simulation and the percentage of cases who started RT on their initial consultation for all new cases referred to the RRRP. RESULTS From 1996 to 2003, the number of cases seen in consultation increased from just over 200 cases annually in the first 2 years to about 500 cases per year in the last 4 years, for a total of 3,290. There were 1,792 (54%) men and 1,498 (46%) women; median age was 69 years (range, 21-95 years). Breast, lung, genitourinary and gastrointestinal primaries accounted for over 80% of all referrals. The majority was referred for palliative treatment of symptomatic bone (70%) or brain (14%) metastases. The dose fractionation for bone metastases was a single 8-Gy fraction in 45%, 20 Gy in five fractions in 42%, 30 Gy in ten fractions in 4% and other dose fractionations in 9%. Nearly 90% were seen within 2 weeks of referral (38% within 1 week). Eighty-five percent were simulated on the day of their initial consultation. Sixty percent started their RT treatment on the day of their consultation visit. The overall median interval from referral to treatment was 8 days. CONCLUSION Over the past 8 years, the annual number of new cases referred to the RRRP has doubled. The overall median interval from referral to consultation was 8 days. Sixty percent were simulated, planned and started treatment on the day of their initial consultation. We therefore are meeting our goal of providing rapid access to palliative RT for symptomatic cancer patients.","output":"An innovative rapid response radiotherapy program to reduce waiting time for palliative radiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, calls for urgent developments of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-protein), which consists of trimeric polypeptide chains with glycosylated residues on the surface, triggers the virus entry into a host cell. Extensive structural and functional studies on this protein have rapidly advanced our understanding of the S-protein structure at atomic resolutions, while most of structural studies overlook the effect of glycans attached to S-protein on the conformational stability and functional motions between the inactive Down and the active Up forms. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both Down and Up forms of a fully glycosylated S-protein in solution as well as targeted MD (TMD) simulations between them to elucidate key inter-domain interactions for stabilizing each form and inducing the large-scale conformational transitions. The residue-level interaction analysis of the simulation trajectories detects distinct amino-acid residues and N-glycans as determinants on conformational stability of each form. During the conformational transitions between them, inter-domain interactions mediated by glycosylated residues are switched to play key roles on the stabilization of another form. Electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds between the three receptor binding domains work as driving forces to initiate the conformational transitions toward the active form. This study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying conformational stability and functional motions of S-protein, which are relevant for vaccines and antiviral drugs developments.","output":"Elucidation of Interactions Regulating Conformational Stability and Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Se is a micronutrient essential for human health. Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low. We suggest the use of appropriate markers to assess the Se status of COVID-19 patients and possible supplementation may be beneficial in limiting the severity of symptoms, especially in countries where Se status is regarded as sub-optimal.","output":"Selenium and viral infection: are there lessons for COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent screening study highlighted a molecular compound, apilimod, for its efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while another compound, tetrandrine, demonstrated a remarkable synergy with the benchmark antiviral drug, remdesivir.

Here, we aimed to develop a predictive model based on the immune and inflammatory response to discriminate patients with severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and immune inflammatory reaction indicators were collected and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors, which were further used to construct a predictive model. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve, and optimal diagnostic threshold was calculated; these were further validated by 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. We screened three key indicators, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and IgA, for predicting severe COVID-19 and obtained a combined neutrophil, eosinophil, and IgA ratio (NEAR) model (NEU [10(9)/liter] ? 150EOS [10(9)/liter] + 3IgA [g/liter]). NEAR achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961, and when a threshold of 9 was applied, the sensitivity and specificity of the predicting model were 100% and 88.89%, respectively. Thus, NEAR is an effective index for predicting the severity of COVID-19 and can be used as a powerful tool for clinicians to make better clinical decisions. IMPORTANCE The immune inflammatory response changes rapidly with the progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and is responsible for clearance of the virus and further recovery from the infection. However, the intensified immune and inflammatory response in the development of the disease may lead to more serious and fatal consequences, which indicates that immune indicators have the potential to predict serious cases. Here, we identified both eosinophils and serum IgA as prognostic markers of COVID-19, which sheds light on new research directions and is worthy of further research in the scientific research field as well as clinical application. In this study, the combination of NEU count, EOS count, and IgA level was included in a new predictive model of the severity of COVID-19, which can be used as a powerful tool for better clinical decision-making.","output":"Early Prediction of Severe COVID-19 in Patients by a Novel Immune-Related Predictive Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The purpose of our study was to determine which groups of orthopaedic providers favour virtual care, and analyze overall orthopaedic provider perceptions of virtual care. We hypothesize that providers with less clinical experience will favour virtual care, and that orthopaedic providers overall will show increased preference for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased preference during non-pandemic circumstances. METHODS: An orthopaedic research consortium at an academic medical system developed a survey examining provider perspectives regarding orthopaedic virtual care. Survey items were scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Providers with less experience were more likely to recommend virtual care for follow-up visits (3.61 on the Likert scale (SD 0.95) vs 2.90 (SD 1.23); p = 0.006) and feel that virtual care was essential to patient wellbeing (3.98 (SD 0.95) vs 3.00 (SD 1.16); p < 0.001) during the pandemic. Less experienced providers also viewed virtual visits as providing a similar level of care as in-person visits (2.41 (SD 1.02) vs 1.76 (SD 0.87); p = 0.006) and more time-efficient than in-person visits (3.07 (SD 1.19) vs 2.34 (SD 1.14); p = 0.012) in non-pandemic circumstances. During the pandemic, most providers viewed virtual care as effective in providing essential care (83.6%, n = 51) and wanted to schedule patients for virtual care follow-up (82.2%, n = 50); only 10.9% (n = 8) of providers preferred virtual visits in non-pandemic circumstances. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic providers with less clinical experience seem to favourably view virtual care both during the pandemic and under non-pandemic circumstances.

To tackle the outbreak, a number of drugs are being explored or have been utilized based on past experience. A molecular descriptor (or topological index) is a numerical value that describes a compound's molecular structure and has been successfully employed in many QSPR/QSAR investigations to represent several physicochemical attributes. In order to determine topological characteristics of graphs, coindices (topological) take nonadjacent pair of vertices into account. In this study, we introduced CoM-polynomial and numerous degree-based topological coindices for several antiviral medicines such as lopinavir, ritonavir remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, theaflavin, thalidomide, and arbidol which were studied using the CoM-polynomial approach. In the QSPR model, the linear regression approach is used to analyze the relationships between physicochemical properties and topological coindices. The findings show that the topological coindices under investigation have a substantial relationship with the physicochemical properties of possible antiviral medicines in question. As a result, topological coindices may be effective tools for studying antiviral drugs in the future for QSPR analyses.

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C) were subjected to six decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, plasma sterilization (Sterrad?), ethylene oxide (ETO, 3M?), dry heat sterilization, and moist heat sterilization (autoclaving). The integrity of the N95 masks was assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle sizes ranging 0.3-0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and autoclaving showed a drop, and UV irradiation showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation after decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma sterilization is recommended for decontamination of N95 masks in low-resource settings. ETO is not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, although the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in results, evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis.","output":"Reprocessing of N95 masks: Experience from a resource-limited setting in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article uses survey data to describe, discuss, and examine the ways in which small and rural public libraries adjusted their programming during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the best DNA vaccine delivery systems uses a live bacterial vector as the carrier. The live bacterial vector induces a robust immune response due to its natural characteristics that are recognized by the immune system. Moreover, the route of administration used by the live bacterial vector is through the mucosal route that beneficially induces both mucosal and systemic immune responses. The mucosal route is not invasive, making the vaccine easy to administer, increasing the patients acceptance. Lactic acid bacterium is one of the most promising bacteria used as a live bacterial vector.

Furthermore, reassortant viruses were amplified in adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells with certification, and their growth characteristics were detected in aMDCK cells and new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells. Finally, the plaque-forming ability, biosafety, and immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses were evaluated. RESULTS: The HA titers of these CVVs produced in proprietary suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells and chicken embryos were 2- to 8-fold higher than those in aMDCK cells. All H7N9 CVVs showed attenuated characteristics by trypsin-dependent plaque assay and chicken embryo lethality test. The alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5 (derived from the fifth wave H7N9 virus A/Guangdong/SP440/2017) vaccine had the highest immunogenicity and cross-reactivity among the four H7N9 CVVs. Finally, we found that AddaVax adjuvant improved the cross-reactivity of low pathogenic H7N9 virus against highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that cell-derived H7N9 CVVs possessed high growth rate in new sMDCK cells and low pathogenicity in chicken embryo, and that CVVs generated by this platform are also suitable for both cell- and egg-based prepandemic vaccine production.","output":"Development of high-growth influenza H7N9 prepandemic candidate vaccine viruses in suspension MDCK cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the lack of an effective vaccine and antiviral treatment, convalescent plasma (CP) has been a promising therapeutic approach in past pandemics Accumulating evidence in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic corroborates the safety of CP therapy and preliminary data underline the potential efficacy Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted CP therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients under the emergency use authorization, albeit additional clinical studies are still needed The imminent threat of a second or even multiple waves of COVID-19 has compelled health authorities to delineate and calibrate a feasible preparedness algorithm for deploying CP as an immediate therapeutic intervention The success of preparedness programs depends on the interdisciplinary actions of multiple actors in politics, science, and healthcare In this review, we evaluate the current status of CP therapy for COVID-19 patients and address the challenges that confront the implementation of CP Finally, we propose a pandemic preparedness framework for future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and unknown pathogen outbreaks","output":"Convalescent Plasma against COVID-19: A Broad-Spectrum Therapeutic Approach for Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To understand the epidemiological and clinical features of the symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric cases of COVID-19, we carried out a prospective study in Shanghai during the period of January 19 to April 30, 2020.

Nine (81.8%) local cases and 12 (31.6%) imported cases had a definitive epidemiological exposure. Twenty-eight (57.1%) were symptomatic and 21 (42.9%) were asymptomatic. Neither asymptomatic nor symptomatic cases progressed to severe diseases. The mean duration of viral shedding for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract was 14.1  6.4 days in asymptomatic cases and 14.8  8.4 days in symptomatic cases (P > 0.05). Forty-five (91.8%) cases had viral RNA detected in stool.

Curtin University, Australia, integrated blended-delivery immunization training into the final-year Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons) and graduate-entry Master of Pharmacy curricula in 2019 and 2020, utilizing materials licenced from the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated changes in students attitude, confidence, self-perceived knowledge and self-perceived skills pre- and post-training delivered in 2020. METHODS: Pre- and post-training questionnaires featured 42 opinion statements grouped under headings Attitudes, Confidence, Self-Perceived Knowledge and Self-Perceived Skills, and answered using five-point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Completed pre- and post-training questionnaires were matched using respondent-generated codes. Data were subjected to descriptive and multivariate regression analysis to test pre-post changes and associations and changes in mean scores. RESULTS: 128 (95.5%) and 132 (98.5%) students completed the pre- and post-training questionnaires, respectively. Immunization training resulted in significant (p<0.05) improvement in students mean Confidence score (3.33 vs 3.96), Self-Perceived Knowledge score (3.08 vs 4.47) and Self-Perceived Skills score (2.81 vs 4.55). Improvement in students mean Attitude score was also statistically significant (4.45 vs 4.61), yet more positively skewed pre-training. No significant pre-post differences were found between the Bachelor and Master students. Post-training, all respondents agreed that the training program increased their attitude, confidence, perceived knowledge and perceived skills, rating the training experience as either Excellent (91.6%) or Good (8.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Immunization training integrated into final-year BPharm (Hons) and MPharm curricula improved Attitudes, Confidence, Self-Perceived Knowledge and Self-Perceived Skills, all key to further role development in public health.

This study assessed outcomes in patients who underwent robotic MRND through BABA using the da Vinci Xi system. Methods The medical records of 40 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, bilateral central neck dissection and MRND from September 2018 to March 2020 were reviewed retrospectively, including 12 who underwent robotic surgery and 28 who underwent open surgery. All operations were performed by a single endocrine surgeon. Results Operation time was significantly longer in the robotic than in the open group (277.08  32.64 versus 191.43  60.43 minutes, respectively, p < 0.01), but the number of retrieved lymph nodes did not differ (32.58 9.31 versus 34.54 10.90, respectively, p = 0.569). The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism was significantly lower in the robotic group (16.7% [2/12] versus 53.6% [15/28], p = 0.041). Hospital stay was shorter (3.92 0.90 versus 4.71 1.63 days) and pain score on the first postoperative day was lower (2.92 0.29 versus 3.18 0.67) in the robotic group. Six (50%) of the 12 patients in the robotic group had stimulated thyroglobulin levels <1.0 ng/mL. Conclusions Robotic MRND through BABA has several advantages, including excellent cosmetic outcomes and a lower incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism than open MRND.

Injuries are the leading cause of death in people aged 5C24 years and a leading cause of disability. In most low-income and middle-income countries where the majority of global child injury burden occurs, systems for routinely collecting injury data are limited. METHODS: A new model of injury surveillance for use in emergency departments in Nepal was designed and piloted. Data from patients presenting with injuries were collected prospectively over 12 months and used to describe the epidemiology of paediatric injury presentations. RESULTS: The total number of children <18 years of age presenting with injury was 2696, representing 27% of all patients presenting with injuries enrolled. Most injuries in children presenting to the emergency departments in this study were unintentional and over half of children were <10 years of age. Falls, animal bites/stings and road traffic injuries accounted for nearly 75% of all injuries with poisonings, burns and drownings presenting proportionately less often. Over half of injuries were cuts, bites and open wounds. In-hospital child mortality from injury was 1%. CONCLUSION: Injuries affecting children in Nepal represent a significant burden. The data on injuries observed from falls, road traffic injuries and injuries related to animals suggest potential areas for injury prevention.

Patients with severe COVID-19 disease progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with respiratory and multiple organ failure. It is believed that dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial dysfunction contribute to the pathogenesis of severe diseases. However, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the role of endothelial cells are poorly understood. METHODS: Well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells were used to explore the cytokine and chemokine production after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the susceptibility to infection, immune response, and expression of adhesion molecules, in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) exposed to conditioned medium from infected epithelial cells. The effect of imatinib on HPMVECs exposed to conditioned medium was evaluated. RESULTS: We demonstrated the production of IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 from the infected human airway cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) did not support productive replication of SARS-CoV-2, treatment of HPMVECs with conditioned medium collected from infected airway cells induced an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and vascular adhesion molecules. Imatinib inhibited the up-regulation of these cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in HPMVECs treated with conditioned medium.

Oncological and hepatobiliary societies have drafted recommendations regarding the adaptation of guidelines for the management of HCC to the current healthcare situation. This review focuses on specific recommendations for the surgical treatment of HCC (i.e., hepatic resection and liver transplantation), which still represents the best chance of cure for patients with very early and early HCC. While surgery should be pursued for very selected patients in institutions where standards of care are maintained, alternative or bridging methods, mostly thermoablation and transarterial therapies, can be used until surgery can be performed.

In this study, we implemented adaptive signal detection approaches to correct spurious association, hidden factors, and confounder misclassification when the covariates are unknown or unmeasured on medications affecting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially creating an increased risk of life-threatening outcomes in high-risk patients. We consider pulmonary ADE (pADE) profiles in a long-standing group of therapeutics, RAS-acting agents, in patients with hypertension associated with high-risk for COVID-19. Using these techniques, we confirmed our hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness. Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associates with 64% and 56% of pADEs, respectively.

However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-&#945;, and RBV plus LPV/r plus IFN-&#945; at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-d follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The outcomes include the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases, and adverse events during the study period. Results: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 d in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group, as compared with 13 and 15 d in the RBV+IFN-&#945;-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group, respectively (p=0.23). The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

The main objective of the Biathlon Injury and Illness Study (BIIS) is to provide the first comprehensive epidemiological profile of injury and illness in biathlon athletes during two consecutive Biathlon World Cup seasons over 2-years. METHODS: The BIIS study methodology is established in line with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) injury and illness surveillance protocols using a biathlon-specific injury and illness report form. Team medical staff will provide weekly data using injury and illness definitions of any injury or illness that receives medical attention regardless of time loss. Injuries or illness must be diagnosed and reported by a qualified medical professional (eg, team physician, physiotherapist) to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. Descriptive statistics will be used to identify the type, body region and nature of the injury or illness and athlete demographics such as age and gender. Summary measures of injury and illnesses per 1000 athlete-days will be calculated whereby the total number of athletes will be multiplied by the number of days in the season to calculate athlete-days.

This has prompted immediate urgency to discover promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 viral proteases, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro), have become the promising target to study due to their essential functions in spreading the virus by RNA transcription, translation, protein synthesis, processing and modification, virus replication, and infection of the host. As such, understanding of the structure and function of these two proteases is unavoidable as platforms for the development of inhibitors targeting this protein which further arrest the infection and spread of the virus. While the abundance of reports on the screening of natural compounds such as SARS-CoV-2 proteases inhibitors are available, the microorganisms-based compounds (peptides and non-peptides) remain less studied. Indeed, microorganisms-based compounds are also one of the potent antiviral candidates against COVID-19. Microbes, especially bacteria and fungi, are other resources to produce new drugs as well as nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids. Thus, we have compiled various reported literature in detail on the structures, functions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteases, and potential inhibitors from microbial sources as assistance to other researchers working with COVID-19. The compounds are also compared to HIV protease inhibitors which suggested the microorganisms-based compounds are advantageous as SARS-CoV2 proteases inhibitors.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 111 million people worldwide and caused over 2.47 million deaths. Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue with severe cases that can develop into pneumonia, myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, and even multi-organ failure. Current clinical management consists largely of supportive care as commonly administered treatments, including convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and high-dose glucocorticoids. These have demonstrated modest benefits in a small subset of hospitalized patients, with only dexamethasone showing demonstrable efficacy in reducing mortality and length of hospitalization. At this time, no SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs are available, although several vaccines have been approved for use in recent months. In this review, we will evaluate the efficacy of preclinical and clinical drugs that precisely target three different, essential steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle: the spike protein during entry, main protease (MPro) during proteolytic activation, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during transcription. We will assess the advantages and limitations of drugs that precisely target evolutionarily well-conserved domains, which are less likely to mutate, and therefore less likely to escape the effects of these drugs. We propose that a multi-drug cocktail targeting precise proteins, critical to the viral replication cycle, such as spike protein, MPro, and RdRp, will be the most effective strategy of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and limiting its spread in the general population.","output":"Precision therapeutic targets for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To explore the correlation between cardiac\\\\related comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, acute myocardial injury, and severity level, outcomes in COVID\\\\19 patients.

Outcome measures were events and total sample size for comorbidities, acute cardiac injury, and laboratory parameters of these biomarkers. The study was performed with Stata version 15.1. RESULTS: Seventy studies, with a total of 15,354 cases were identified. The results showed that COVID\\\\19's severity was related to cardiovascular disease. Similar odds ratios (ORs) were achieved in hypertension except for severe versus critical group (OR = 1.406; 95% CI, 0.942C2.097; p = .095).

In addition to this, a variety of socioeconomic factors have been linked to increased COVID-19 rates and increased mortality, such as race, age, income, mobility, and education level.This project aims to develop an information system to help advise vaccine distributors and state governments on how to effectively distribute vaccines to prioritize high risk individuals. The information system incorporates state-level data of the population with underlying medical conditions, demographics, overall state income, education level, and state mobility to formulate a mortality index. State-level data on the number of vaccines available and doses already administered are also incorporated into the information system to generate a vaccine index. The mortality and vaccine indices for each state are coupled to generate a vaccine priority ranking which can be used to advise vaccine distribution.The prototype can successfully link the data described above to a map of the US and then color code states according to the vaccine priority ranking. Implementation of this prototype will enable optimal vaccine distribution and reduce instances of severe or fatal COVID-19 illnesses as well as reduce costs associated with oversupply of vaccines in a single region.

METHODS: Excess mortality due to COVID-19 was estimated directly based on various data sources, and indirectly, based on the difference between the observed and expected number of deaths from serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) and all-natural causes in 2020 had there been no COVID-19. The absence of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was adjusted based on the proportion of those who tested positive among the tested individuals whose death was attributed to COVID-19.

We can take advantage of their ability to modulate host-virus interactions through mediating RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Investigations into miRNA and SARS-CoV-2 interactions can reveal novel therapeutic approaches against this virus. The viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were searched using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) for highly similar sequences, to identify potential binding sites for miRNAs hypothesized to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. miRNAs that target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for host cell entry, were also predicted. Several relevant miRNAs were identified, and their potential roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infections were further assessed. Current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 are limited and have not generated sufficient evidence on safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19.

The risk of crisis points (eg, hospitalizations) for caregivers increases with the absence of physical activity. The COVID-19 pandemic is highly likely to have increased the risk of crisis points for caregivers by increasing the amount of time spent indoors due to shielding and lockdown restrictions. Thus, accessible evidence-based tools to facilitate physical activity for caregivers indoors are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to co-design and develop a novel mobile app to educate and support carers in the undertaking of regular physical activity at home during and beyond COVID-19 restrictions via integration of the transtheoretical model of behavior change and UK physical activity guidelines. METHODS: We co-designed a mobile app, CareFit, by directly involving caregivers, health care professionals, and social care professionals in the requirements, capturing, and evaluation phases of three Agile Scrum design and development sprints. Seven participants representing multistakeholder views took part in three co-design sessions, each of which was followed by a development sprint. Requirements for CareFit were grounded in a combination of behavioral change science and UK government guidelines for physical activity. RESULTS: Participants identified different barriers and enablers to physical activity, such as a lack of time, recognition of existing activities, and concerns regarding safely undertaking physical activity. Requirements analysis highlighted the importance of simplicity in design and a need to anchor development around the everyday needs of caregivers (eg, easy-to-use video instructions). Our final prototype app integrated guidance for undertaking physical activity at home through educational, physical activity, and communication components. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating government guidelines with models of behavioral change into a mobile app to support the physical activity of carers is novel. We found that integrating core physical activity guidelines into a co-designed smartphone app with functionality such as a weekly planner and educational material for users is feasible. This work holds promise to fill the gap of effective physical activity solutions for caregivers both during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is now needed to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the approach in real-world settings.","output":"A Novel Mobile App (CareFit) to Support Informal Caregivers to Undertake Regular Physical Activity From Home During and Beyond COVID-19 Restrictions: Co-design and Prototype Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing the contribution of mobility restrictions to the control of Covid-19 diffusion is an urgent challenge of global import. We analyze the relation between transmission rates (estimated effective reproduction numbers) and societal mobility levels using fine-grained daily mobility data from Google and Apple in an international panel of 87 countries and a panel of all states in the United States. Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.04-0.09 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R(t), depending on geographical region and modelling choice. According to these estimates, to avoid the critical value of R = 1, easing mobility restrictions may have to be limited to below pre-pandemic levels or delayed until other non-mobility related preventative measures reduce R to a level of 0.55-0.7 in Europe, a level of 0.64-0.76 in Asia, and a level of 0.8 in the United States.

Realising these benefits will depend in part upon the behavioural and social impacts of certification. The aim of this rapid review was to describe public attitudes towards certification, and its possible impact on uptake of testing and vaccination, protective behaviours, and crime. Method A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, pre-print databases, and the grey literature, from 2000 to December 2020. Studies were included if they measured attitudes towards or behavioural consequences of health certificates based on one of three indices of Covid-19 status: test-negative result for current infectiousness, test-positive for antibodies conferring natural immunity, or vaccination(s) conferring immunity. Results Thirty-three papers met the inclusion criteria, only three of which were rated as low risk of bias. Public attitudes were generally favourable towards the use of immunity certificates for international travel, but unfavourable towards their use for access to work and other activities. A significant minority was strongly opposed to the use of certificates of immunity for any purpose. The limited evidence suggested that intention to get vaccinated varied with the activity enabled by certification or vaccination (e.g., international travel). Where vaccination is seen as compulsory this could lead to unwillingness to accept a subsequent vaccination. There was some evidence that restricting access to settings and activities to those with antibody test certificates may lead to deliberate exposure to infection in a minority. Behaviours that reduce transmission may decrease upon health certificates based on any of the three indices of Covid-19 status, including physical distancing and handwashing. Conclusions The limited evidence suggests that health certification in relation to COVID-19 (outside of the context of international travel) has the potential for harm as well as benefit. Realising the benefits while minimising the harms will require real-time evaluations allowing modifications to maximise the potential contribution of certification to enable safer access to a range of activities.","output":"Behavioural responses to Covid-19 health certification: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates a family of approximate solutions for the fractional model (in the Liouville-Caputo sense) of the Ebola virus via an accurate numerical procedure (Chebyshev spectral collocation method) We reduce the proposed epidemiological model to a system of algebraic equations with the help of the properties of the Chebyshev polynomials of the third kind Some theorems about the convergence analysis and the existence-uniqueness solution are stated Finally, some numerical simulations are presented for different values of the fractional-order and the other parameters involved in the coefficients We also note that we can apply the proposed method to solve other models","output":"An efficient spectral collocation method for the dynamic simulation of the fractional epidemiological model of the Ebola virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A brief description of attitudes and representations of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among patients in a psychiatric Parisian office.

We used three studies consisting of: 168 interval cases and 498 matched controls; 422 screen-detected cases and 1,197 matched controls; and 354 younger-diagnosis cases and 944 controls frequency-matched for age at mammogram. We conducted conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of individually- and frequency-matched studies, respectively. We estimated measure-specific risk gradients as the change in odds per standard deviation of controls after adjusting for age and body mass index (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For interval, screen-detected and younger-diagnosis cancer risks, the best fitting models (OPERAs [95% confidence intervals]) involved: Cumulus (1.81 [1.41 to 2.31]) and Cirrus (1.72 [1.38 to 2.14]); Cirrus (1.49 [1.32 to 1.67]) and Cirrocumulus (1.16 [1.03 to 1.31]); and Cirrus (1.70 [1.48 to 1.94]) and Cirrocumulus (1.46 [1.27 to 1.68]), respectively.

OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of increasing perioperative blood flow using fluids with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs. Outcomes were mortality, morbidity, resource utilization and health status. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012) and EMBASE (1982 to March 2012). We manually searched the proceedings of major conferences and personal reference databases up to December 2011. We contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for published and unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials with or without blinding. We included studies involving adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery (patients having a procedure in an operating room). The intervention met the following criteria. 'Perioperative' was defined as starting up to 24 hours before surgery and stopping up to six hours after surgery. 'Targeted to increase global blood flow' was defined by explicit measured goals that were greater than in controls, specifically one or more of cardiac index, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, stroke volume (and the respective derived indices), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)), oxygen extraction ratio (0(2)ER) or lactate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data. We contacted study authors for additional data. We used Review Manager software. MAIN RESULTS We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.05, P = 0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and the intervention was better than control when inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models were used, RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The results were also sensitive to withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The rates of three morbidities were reduced by increasing global blood flow: renal failure, RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.90); respiratory failure, RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.93); and wound infections, RR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84). There were no differences in the rates of nine other morbidities: arrhythmia, pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary oedema, or venous thrombosis. The number of patients with complications was reduced by the intervention, RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80). Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by a mean of 1.16 days (95% CI 0.43 to 1.89, P = 0.002). There was no difference in critical care length of stay. There were insufficient data to comment on quality of life and cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It remains uncertain whether increasing blood flow using fluids, with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs, reduces mortality in adults undergoing surgery. The primary analysis in this review (mortality at longest follow-up) showed no difference between the intervention and control, but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, the withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and is dominated by a single large RCT. Overall, for every 100 patients in whom blood flow is increased perioperatively to defined goals, one can expect 13 in 100 patients (from 40/100 to 27/100) to avoid a complication, 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8/100 to 6/100), 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10/100 to 5/100), and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10/100 to 6/100). On average, patients receiving the intervention stay in hospital one day less. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.","output":"Perioperative increase in global blood flow to explicit defined goals and outcomes following surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The elderly population is the group most threatened by COVID-19, with the highest mortality rates.

We report the results of a follow-up evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 148 convalescent plasma donors who participated in a phase 2 study at a median of 8.3 months (range 6.8-10.5 months) post first symptom onset. Monitoring responses over time, we found contraction of antibody responses for all four antigens tested, with Spike antibodies showing higher persistence than Nucleocapsid antibodies. A piecewise linear random-effects multivariate regression analysis showed a bi-phasic antibody decay with a more pronounced decrease during the first 6 months post symptoms onset by analysis of two intervals. Interestingly, antibodies to Spike showed better longevity whereas their neutralization ability contracted faster.

However, fever can be an unpleasant symptom of infection and excessive fever (>41o C) can cause irreversible protein denaturation and result in tissue damage, seizure, coma and death. Common therapeutic approaches to fever include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase inhibitors, however these approaches are ineffective for reducing prostaglandin-independent fevers, can interfere with adaptive and innate immune defenses and are contraindicated for use in some viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Although research over the past couple of decades has defined the fundamental central nervous system (CNS) pathways necessary for the lipopolysaccharide model of bacterial fever, the CNS circuits mediating viral fevers are almost completely unknown. Double-stranded RNA is an intermediary in viral replication and serves as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that elicits the acute phase responses to viral infection. Systemic administration of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic double stranded RNA, mimics the acute phase responses to viral infection. Neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus area (rRPa) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus play important roles in the control of the sympathetic outflow to thermoeffectors, therefore we hypothesized that neurons in these areas would be essential for fever elicited by a model of viral fever, intravenous (iv) poly I:C. Female and male Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with urethane and -chloralose (for BAT sympathetic nerve recording, n=3) or isoflurane (for cutaneous vasoconstriction experiments, n=3) received iv poly I:C (1mg/kg for experiments with sympathetic nerve recording, or 500g/kg for experiments for cutaneous vasoconstriction). Systemically administered poly I:C increased BAT SNA (+601  161% baseline), BAT temperature (TBAT; +3.1  0.8C), and expired CO2 (+0.9  0.2%). Poly I:C also elicited CVC, as observed by reductions in paw or tail skin temperature (TPAW/TTail) (-2.6  1.2C). A nanoinjection of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, AP5 and CNQX in the rRPa reversed poly I:C-evoked increases in BAT SNA (-596  128% baseline), TBAT (-1.3  0.2C), and expired CO2 (-0.5  0.1%). Nanoinjection of AP5 and CNQX into the DMH reversed the polyI:C-evoked reduction in TPAW/TTail (+2.8  1.1C). These data suggest that the activity of neurons in the rRPa and the DMH are necessary for poly I:C-induced activation of BAT thermogenesis and cutaneous vasoconstriction. These data define critical components of the neural circuits for poly I:C-induced fever, highlight differences between the neural circuitry mediating bacterial fever and viral fever, and provide a foundation for elucidating additional brain mechanisms responsible for viral fever.","output":"A Foundation for the Neural Control of Viral Fever."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We investigate the mental health status of all the staff members who worked for the designated hospital during the initial stage of COVID-19, so as to understand the severity of mental health problems, and analyze the risk factors. Methods: : Through the patients health questionnaire-9(PHQ-9) and panic disorder severity scales(PDSS), we surveyed the status of depression and panic disorder of the staff who participated in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in designated hospital in the early stage of epidemic. The data is described by the number of cases (percentage), median and interquartile range. The chi square test was used for categorical variables and the rank sum test was used for continuous variables. The risk factors of severe depression or panic disorder were analyzed by binary logistic regression test. Results: : Totally 702 questionnaires were sent out and 694(98.9%) was received and qualified, the median score of PHQ-9 among all the staff was 1 (IQR,0-4), 143(20.6%) of them had depression, 39 (5.6%) had serious depression;the median score of PDSS was 2 (IQR,0-5), 81 (11.7%) of them had panic disorder and 47(6.7%) of them had severe panic disorder;Among the people in different work lines, the first-line staff scored the highest: PHQ-9 score was 4 (0-8);PDSS score was 4 (1-9), which were significantly higher than the second-line and third-line staff (P<0.001).

The infection is usually caused by viruses including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Influenza is the only viral infection preventable by vaccination and occurs predominately during annual winter epidemics. Bacterial infection such as acute rhinopharyngitis is uncommon and usually presents with either persistent symptoms of an URTI lasting over a week or worsening course after initial improvement or acute onset with high fever and inflammatory changes confined to the pharynx. Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli, cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated. Fever in CNS infection is the most common presenting symptom in children beyond the neonatal age owing to the presence of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF in the blood or within the CNS. In MCD, fever was the first symptom in children younger than 5 years and 94% developed fever at some point. Viral exanthems are common causes of febrile illness in children. More than 50 viral agents are known to cause a rash. Historically, exanthems were numbered in the order in which they were differentiated from other exanthems. Thus the first was measles; second, scarlet fever; third, rubella; forth, so-called Filatov-Dukes disease (no longer recognized as an entity); fifth, erythema infectiosum; and sixth, exanthema subitum.

We studied air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, Black Carbon (BC), and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) level, and observed significantly sudden reduced. In India, most of the anthropogenic activities completely stopped. Therefore, we studied the levels of BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations, their sources apportion, and health risk assessment during normal days, lockdown (from lockdown 1.0 to lockdown 4.0) and unlock down 1.0 situation at Sakchi, Jamshedpur city. It was observed that lockdowns and unlock down situations BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower than regular days. We applied the advanced air mass back trajectory (AMBT) model to locate airborne particulate matter dispersal from different directions to strengthen the new result. The diagnostic ratio analyses of BC shows that wood burning contribution was too high during the lockdown situations. However, during normal days, the PAHs source profile was dedicated toward biomass, coal burning, and vehicle emission as primary sources of PAHs. During the lockdown period, emission from biomass and coal burning was a significant contributor to PAHs.

The possibility of transmission through fur animals and contaminated pelts, along with the safety of those working with them, is a major concern. SARS-CoV-2 can infect minks and raccoon dogs and has spread to mink farms in numerous countries. Here, we studied the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on blue fox, Finn raccoon, and American mink pelt, fake fur, cotton, plastic, faux leather, and polyester and tested its inactivation by UV light and heat treatment. We detected infectious virus up to 5 days on plastic, up to 1 day on fake fur, less than a day on cotton, polyester, and faux leather, and even 10 days on mink fur. UV light failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on pelts, most likely due to the mechanical protection by the fur. Hence, it should not be used to inactivate the virus on fur products, and its use for other surfaces should also be considered carefully.

Combining data on mammal species hosting zoonotic viruses and mammals known to be in current and future wildlife trade,6 we found that one-quarter (26.5%) of the mammals in wildlife trade harbor 75% of known zoonotic viruses, a level much higher than domesticated and non-traded mammals.

RESULTS: A total of 511 valid questionnaires were finally retrieved. There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: People in isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were at the level of mild to moderate depression. Female was higher than male; nurse was higher than doctor; middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles; junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above; isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions (p < 0.05). Loneliness scores: Doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of other medical departments (p < 0.05). Social support: Doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of other departments (p < 0.05). The score of social support was negatively correlated with depression and loneliness (p < 0.001), while depression was positively correlated with loneliness (p < 0.001). Health care workers most want to receive one-to-one psychological counseling (29.75%), and provide crisis management (24.07%). The awareness rate of health care workers on COVID-19's knowledge was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological problems of health care workers, especially women, nurses with low educational background, low professional title, and staff in the epidemic prevention and control positions are relatively serious.","output":"Mental health problems and social supports in the COVID-19 healthcare workers: a Chinese explanatory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Luego de que la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declarara la pandemia por el nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19), se implementaron medidas a nivel mundial con el objetivo de contener su progresion El 20 de marzo de 2020 se inicio el confinamiento preventivo obligatorio en Argentina Estudios realizados en el marco de esta pandemia en China, han evidenciado consecuencias psicologicas como resultado del temor al contagio y de las medidas de aislamiento El objetivo del presente estudio es explorar a traves de una encuesta autoadministrada por via electronica, actitudes y temores frente al COVID-19, la presencia de sintomatologia depresiva y el patron de consumo de alcohol de la poblacion argentina durante el confinamiento (n = 759) Como resultado, observamos que el temor al COVID-19 fue mayor en las personas de entre 55 y 59 anos, con un descenso abrupto en los mayores de 70;que el animo depresivo y el incremento en el consumo de alcohol fueron mas frecuentes en los mas jovenes y que el estado de animo depresivo mostro una frecuencia mayor en quienes perdieron el empleo durante el confinamiento Finalmente, observamos que el grado de acuerdo de los participantes con la medida de confinamiento fue superior al 90% incluso en aquellas personas que sufrieron una disminucion de sus ingresos mayor al 80% durante la cuarentena Los resultados de este estudio brindan informacion sobre grupos de riesgo para el desarrollo de sintomas psicopatologicos Estos resultados constituyen una base necesaria para el diseno de estrategias preventivas y terapeuticas focalizadas","output":"Efectos psicologicos de la pandemia COVID-19 en la poblacion general de Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The water sector needs to address viral-related public health issues, because water is a virus carrier, which not only spreads viruses (e.g., via drinking water), but also provides information about the circulation of viruses in the community (e.g., via sewage).

Currently, no proper medicine or effective treatment strategies are available; therefore, repurposing of FDA approved drugs may play an important role in overcoming the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 2-O-methyltransferase (2'OMTase), which plays a key role in methylation of viral RNA for evading host immune system. In the present study, the protein sequence of 2'OMTase of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed, and its structure was modeled by a comparative modeling approach and validated. The library of 3000 drugs was screened against the active site of 2'OMTase followed by re-docking analysis. The apo and ligand-bound 2'OMTase were further validated and analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulation. KEY FINDINGS: The modeled structure displayed the conserved characteristic fold of class I MTase family. The quality assessment analysis by SAVES server reveals that the modeled structure follows protein folding rules and of excellent quality. The docking analysis displayed that the active site of 2'OMTase accommodates an array of drugs, which includes alkaloids, antivirals, cardiac glycosides, anticancer, steroids, and other drugs. The redocking and MD simulation analysis of the best 5 FDA approved drugs reveals that these drugs form a stable conformation with the 2'OMTase.

We conducted a randomized controlled study to confirm the effectiveness of remote management using the mobile phone WeChat app on comprehensive management of diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We distributed questionnaires that collected information on the health condition of people with diabetes during the COVID-19 epidemic through the WeChat app. We assigned 90 cases to the intervention group and 90 cases to the control group. The intervention group was managed remotely through the WeChat app, and the control group received traditional medical treatment. The blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), time in range (TIR) and incidence of hypoglycemia were compared after three months of follow-up. RESULTS: The BMI and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) of the control group at 3 months was significantly higher than that at baseline (P < 0.001), and TIR decreased at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure compared with baseline in the control group, while blood pressure decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.05). In the intervention group, fast blood glucose(FBG) and PBG decreased compared with their baseline values, and the TIR level increased, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The FBG, PBG, and TIR of the intervention group were better than those in the control group at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, diabetes treatment has been facing new challenges, and the traditional treatment mode is limited. Remote management can increase TIR without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

Furthermore, there may be a wide variety of intervals from kidney transplantation to VZV infection (including both primary infection and reactivation of VZV), ranging from 2 weeks to 11 years. Therefore, it should be kept in mind that kidney transplant patients are always at high risk of VZV infection, as early recognition and treatment of the disease improves its prognosis. Although the diagnosis of varicella pneumonia is generally made by PCR test of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, our case experience suggests that the less invasive PCR test of sputum may be useful for rapid and accurate diagnosis.

This surgical intervention damages the deeper dermal layers of the skin with implications for wound healing and a risk of scar development. Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy modulates biological processes in different tissues, with a positive effect on many cell types and pathways essential for wound healing. This study investigated the effect of fluorescent light energy (FLE) therapy, a novel type of PBM, on healing after skin grafting in a dermal fibrotic mouse model. Split-thickness human skin grafts were transplanted onto full-thickness excisional wounds on nude mice. Treated wounds were monitored, and excised xenografts were examined to assess healing and pathophysiological processes essential for developing chronic wounds or scarring. Results demonstrated that FLE treatment initially accelerated re-epithelialization and rete ridge formation, while later reduced neovascularization, collagen deposition, myofibroblast and mast cell accumulation, and connective tissue growth factor expression. While there was no visible difference in gross morphology, we found that FLE treatment promoted a balanced collagen remodeling. Collectively, these findings suggest that FLE has a conceivable effect at balancing healing after skin grafting, which reduces the risk of infections, chronic wound development, and fibrotic scarring.","output":"Fluorescent light energy modulates healing in skin grafted mouse model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus is deadly for humans and animals. The ease of its dispersion, coupled with its tremendous capability for ailment and death in infected people, makes it a risk to society. The chest X-ray is conventional but hard to interpret radiographic test for initial diagnosis of coronavirus from other related infections. It bears a considerable amount of information on physiological and anatomical features. To extract relevant information from it can occasionally become challenging even for a professional radiologist. In this regard, deep-learning models can help in swift, accurate and reliable outcomes. Existing datasets are small and suffer from the balance issue. In this paper, we prepare a relatively larger and well-balanced dataset as compared to the available datasets. Furthermore, we analyze deep learning models, namely, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 with numerous variations such as training the models from scratch, fine-tuning without pre-trained weights, fine-tuning along with updating pre-trained weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with pre-trained weights along with applying augmentation. Our results show that fine-tuning with augmentation generates best results in pre-trained models. Finally, we have made architectural adjustments in MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 models to learn more intricate features, which are then merged in our proposed ensemble model. The performance of our model is statistically analyzed against other models using four different performance metrics with paired two-sided t-test on 5 different splits of training and test sets of our dataset. We find that it is statistically better than its competing methods for the four metrics. Thus, the computer-aided classification based on the proposed model can assist radiologists in identifying coronavirus from other related infections in chest X-rays with higher accuracy.

Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of either SAPK significantly attenuated PDCoV replication, whereas addition of a signaling activator augmented virus infectivity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK activation was innocuous to viral entry but significantly detrimental to post uncoating stages of the replication cycle. Remarkably, cytokine gene expression in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells was modified by inhibiting the activation of either SAPK.

Selecting the ideal questionnaire for this purpose may be challenging for researchers. This study aims to review which questionnaires are used to evaluate telemedicine services in the studies, which are most common, and what aspects of telemedicine evaluation do they capture. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched in August 2020 to retrieve articles. Data extracted from the final list of articles included author/year of publication, journal of publication, type of evaluation, and evaluation questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were included in this study. The questionnaire was used for evaluating the satisfaction (49%), usability (34%), acceptance (11.5%), and implementation (2%) of telemedicine services. Among telemedicine specific questionnaires, Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) (19%), Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) (13%), and Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ) (5.5%), were respectively most frequently used in the collected articles.

A negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic on access to care for children with cancer is likely but has not been evaluated. METHODS: A 34\\\\item survey focusing on barriers to pediatric oncology management during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic was distributed to heads of pediatric oncology units within the Pediatric Oncology East and Mediterranean (POEM) collaborative group, from the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia. Responses were collected on April 11 through 22, 2020. Corresponding rates of proven COVID\\\\19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization database. RESULTS: In total, 34 centers from 19 countries participated. Almost all centers applied guidelines to optimize resource utilization and safety, including delaying off\\\\treatment visits, rotating and reducing staff, and implementing social distancing, hand hygiene measures, and personal protective equipment use. Essential treatments, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, were delayed in 29% to 44% of centers, and 24% of centers restricted acceptance of new patients. Clinical care delivery was reported as negatively affected in 28% of centers. Greater than 70% of centers reported shortages in blood products, and 47% to 62% reported interruptions in surgery and radiation as well as medication shortages. However, bed availability was affected in <30% of centers, reflecting the low rates of COVID\\\\19 hospitalizations in the corresponding countries at the time of the survey. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms to approach childhood cancer treatment delivery during crises need to be re\\\\evaluated, because treatment interruptions and delays are expected to affect patient outcomes in this otherwise largely curable disease.","output":"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic on pediatric oncology care in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia Region: A report from the Pediatric Oncology East and Mediterranean (POEM) Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with interest the Editorial by Cron and Chatam (1) suggesting a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) occurring in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, consequently, a possible role for targeted approaches to blocking inflammatory cytokines.","output":"Absence of severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with rheumatic diseases treated with biologic drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lockdown was imposed as a preventive measure for coronavirus disease pandemic Social media was the most common tool available for the masses, including the 1styear medical students during the lockdown The objectives of the present study were to determine the extent of use of social media and the effects on mind-body and social distancing MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was mixed research conducted on 1st-year medical students using convenience sampling The quantitative aspect of E-survey was administered through Google forms sent via E-mail, and structured telephonic interview was conducted as a qualitative aspect on randomly selected 10 students based on predecided interview questions This study was reported as per the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys The analysis was performed using percentages and paired t-test with significance at P &lt;0 05, Chi-square test with Yate's correction Qualitative responses were analyzed using coding and categorization RESULTS: The response rate was 88% Time spent on social media for &gt;4 h increased from 1 1% to 47 72% during lockdown Forty three (48 86%) of the students reported increased mood fluctuations The relation between mood fluctuations and time spent on social media of &gt;4 h was significant 2= 6 41 with P &lt;0 05 Average hours of sleep after using social media before lockdown increased significantly from 6 68 h to 8 10 h during lockdown using paired t-test, where 't' was 6 84 There was a positive impact on communication with friends and family CONCLUSION: Due to the increased extent of use of social media during lockdown, negative mind-body effects have surfaced but emerged as boon in terms of communication ? 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications All rights reserved","output":"Social media effects among freshman medical students during COVID-19 lock-down: An online mixed research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a very large group of virus families that can cause diseases in both different animal species and humans. Infections with different coronaviruses are seen in cats and dogs. The epidemic due to COVID-19 infection and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, which is a coronavirus, continues to spread very rapidly all over the world. In this article, we aimed to compile published studies on COVID-19 infections in cats and dogs, which we are in close contact with. When the studies were examined, it was understood that cats were more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 than dogs after contact with COVID-19 positive individuals in quarantine. Cats may show symptoms in case of infection, compared to dogs. The RBD region where SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors is reported more similar to humans in cats than dogs. ACE2 protein seemed very similar to humans in both cats and dogs compared to other mammals. ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in different tissues of them, according to the study data examined. In a conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected because ACE2 is frequently expressed in different tissues in domestic animals such as cats and dogs, and the binding site is similar to human ACE2 receptors. In order to prevent zoonotic infections such as COVID-19 infections during the epidemic period when different disciplines need to work together with a single health approach, we believe that molecular surveillance studies should be carried out on our close friends such as cats and dogs.

Epigenetics, an essential mechanism for gene regulation based on chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins, is also involved in congenital ASDs. It was recently demonstrated that environmental factors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and mental stress in early life, can change epigenetic status and gene expression, and can cause ASDs. Moreover, environmentally induced epigenetic changes are not erased during gametogenesis and are transmitted to subsequent generations, leading to changes in behavior phenotypes. However, epigenetics has a reversible nature since it is based on the addition or removal of chemical residues, and thus the original epigenetic status may be restored. Indeed, several antidepressants and anticonvulsants used for mental disorders including ASDs restore the epigenetic state and gene expression. Therefore, further epigenetic understanding of ASDs is important for the development of new drugs that take advantages of epigenetic reversibility.","output":"Epigenetic Effect of Environmental Factors on Autism Spectrum Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombosis has long been reported as a potentially deadly complication of respiratory viral infections and has recently received much attention during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

However, the data clearly show that those working in anaesthesia and critical care settings are at lower risk of infection, harm and death from COVID-19 than colleagues working on the wards. The observed safety of anaesthetists and intensivists and increased risk to those in other patient-facing roles has implications for transmission-based infection control precautions. The precautionary principle supports extending training in and use of airborne precaution PPE to all staff working in patient-facing roles who have close contact with coughing patients.

This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in Covid-19 mortality. Methods: : Covid-19 mortality rate was calculated as number of deaths per 100 Covid-19 cases. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, a multivariable linear regression model was applied to a cross-sectional dataset comprising 78 countries and 1,790,550 patients infected by Covid-19. We retrieved data from the Worldometer website and the Worldwide Governance Indicators and World Development Indicators databases. Results: : Covid-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with Covid-19 test number per 1,000 population (RR=0.97;95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, P=0.013) and government effectiveness indicator (RR=0.96;95% CI 0.93 to 0.98, P=0.001).

We included all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a R-IMID and a positive test for COVID-19 up to November 6th, 2020. Medical records of 11,199 patients that suffered COVID-19 in our region, and 6891 with R-IMID from our hospital were reviewed. Incidence data in the different underlying R-IMID were calculated for patients with follow-up in our hospital. Confirmed infection was defined if the patient had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Results: We included 147 patients from our region (96 women/51 men), mean age 6018 years. Underlying R-IMID were: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n=36, 24.5%), Axial spondyloarthritis/Psoriatic arthritis (SpA/PsA) (n=54, 36.7%), Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) (n=16, 10.9%), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=10, 6.8%), sarcoidosis (n=5, 3.4%), Sj?gren's syndrome (SS) (n=4, 2.7%), giant cell arteritis (GCA) (n=3, 2%), Behet's disease (n=3. 2%), ANCA-vasculitis (n=2, 1.4%) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=1, 0.7%). Main comorbidities were hypertension (n=65, 44.2%), dyslipidemia (n=64, 43.5%), age higher than 65 years old (n=55, 37.4%), obesity (n=35, 23.8%), coronary vascular disease (n=27, 18.4%), diabetes mellitus (n=22, 15%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=15, 10.2%) and chronic kidney disease (n=15, 10.2%). Total cumulative COVID-19 incidence in all patients from our region was 1.9% (11,199 /582,905). From 147 patients with COVID-19 from our region, 115 (76 women/39 men;mean age, 5918 years) were followed in our hospital. In the latter, the global cumulative incidence in R-IMID was 1.7% (115/6891), ranging from 1.3% in Systemic Scleroderma (SSc) and Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) up to 5.3% in Behcet's disease (Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, Relative Risk (RR) in different R-IMID compared to the general population was calculated (Table 1). Although RR did not reach statistical significance in any R-IMID, most R-IMID showed a tendency to a higher risk, with the exception of RA, GCA and SSc. Conclusion: In our series, the total cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in R-IMID was similar to the general population.

The study aims to investigate the prognostic accuracy of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in COVID-19 infection. Methods/Design This is a prospective study done in Al-Ain Hospital in the United Arab Emirates. All the Covid-19 patients presenting to the hospital were enrolled over one month from 20/3 to 20/4/2020. We gathered information about their age, sex, mode of transmission and calculated their Neutrophils/Lymphocytes ratio (NLR) from the first complete blood picture on admission. We divided the patients into two groups: those aged 50 years and above and those aged less than 50 years. We chose the best NLR cutoff value based on the Youden index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The target endpoint was the presence or absence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results/Conclusions The study revealed that 48 patients (14%) needed ICU admission, while 296 patients (86%) were admitted to a ward or quarantine facilities. When the patient's age was > 50, and NLR was  3.10, it showed a sensitivity of 95.24% and a specificity of 92.86% for predicting the need for ICU admission. When NLR was  4.21, and the patient's age was < 50, the sensitivity and specificity were 70.3% and 93.7%, respectively. NLR proved to be highly specific and sensitive in helping to identify patients who need more invasive care among people over 50 years of age with COVID-19.

METHODS AND RESULTS An AGI-30 impinger containing particles [MS2 bacteriophage or 30-nm polystyrene latex (PSL)] of known concentration was operated with sterile air. Reaerosolized particles as a function of sampling flow rate and particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid were characterized using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Reaerosolization from the impinger was also compared to that from a BioSampler. Results show that reaerosolization increases as flow rate increases. While the increased particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid leads to an increase in the reaerosolization of PSL particles, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the reaerosolization of virus particles. Reaerosolization of virus particles begins to decrease as the particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid rises above 10(6) PFU ml(-1). This phenomenon results from aggregation of viral particles at high concentrations. Compared with micron-sized particles, nanosized virus particles are easier to aerosolize because of reduced inertia. Reaerosolization from the BioSampler is demonstrated to be significantly less than that from the impinger. CONCLUSIONS Reaerosolization from impingement sampling methods is a mode of loss in airborne virus sampling, although it is not as significant a limitation as the primary particle size of the aerosol.

However, data on current patients', caregivers' and clinicians' satisfaction and limitations of treatments and haemophilia management are limited. AIM Assessing the management satisfaction and unmet needs from the perspective of Italian patients with haemophilia (PWH) without inhibitors (or caregivers if children) and of specialist physicians. METHODS Surveys (for patients18 years, caregivers of children and haemophilia specialists) were developed by a multidisciplinary working group and conducted from November 2019 to June 2020. RESULTS Among 275 participants, 120 (43.6%) were PWH without inhibitors, 79 (28.7%) caregivers and 37 (13.4%) clinicians. Patients and caregivers perceived a higher control of the disease compared to clinicians. However, more than 40% of patients and caregivers reported to feel significantly conditioned by the risk of bleeding during their daily life. PWH reported a 6-month mean/median (range) of bleeds 2.3/.0 (0-24) and caregivers 1.3/.0 (0-16) in children. The treatment burden (frequency of administration) was not satisfactory for more than half adults and caregivers of children treated with prophylaxis. A good access to treatment, haemophilia centres and medical service was reported, with issues associated to the multidisciplinary approach and treatment at emergency department. CONCLUSIONS This large national study provides an updated overview of haemophilia care in Italy from different points of views, highlighting positive aspects and unmet needs. This information can guide future interventions to improve haemophilia management and the assessment of impact of new treatment options.","output":"Haemophilia management and treatment: An Italian survey on patients', caregivers' and clinicians' point of view."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: On November 8, 2016, Oakland, California, voters passed a sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax, which included language to support programs affecting communities and residents most affected by SSB-related health disparities. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively assess the extent to which those communities most affected by SSB-related health disparities were included in implementation decisions and were recipients of funding to support their needs. Methods: A longitudinal case study from 2016 to 2019 in Oakland, CA, explored equity implementation themes through key informant interview transcripts (n=15) triangulated with media (n=90) and archived documents (n=43). Using principals of constant comparative analysis, all documents (n=148) were coded and thematically analyzed in Atlas.ti. Results: SSB taxesdesigned to support communities disproportionately impacted by SSB consumptioncan be implemented with inclusivity and community representation. The Oakland ordinance established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) that partnered with community organizations throughout implementation to ensure inclusivity and recommend funding for programs to address health inequities, described as the spirit of the ordinance. These activities countered the beverage industry's tactics to target lower income communities of color with misinformation campaigns and hinder implementation. Conclusion: A clearly written ordinance provides guidance, which affords an intentional and legal foundation for implementation processes. Establishing a CAB can mitigate inequities as members are invested in the community and initiatives to support residents. Advisory boards are able to liaise between city and local partners, which is a powerful tool for countering opposition campaigns, reaching lower income and communities of color, and ensuring adherence to funding mandates.","output":"Oakland's Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax: Honoring the Spirit of the Ordinance Toward Equitable Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residence Time Distribution (RTD) theory is revisited and tracer technology discussed.

Few data exist examining the utilization of telehealth compared to traditional settings. Bridging this gap is critical to optimizing telehealth utilization and reducing barriers. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of return and post-operative (electronic video [eClinic] and traditional) visits from January 2018 - March 2020 at single tertiary care center. There were 12,359 unique first-encounter patients with 903 eClinic and 11,456 traditional visits. 11,547 patients completed visits while 812 patients did not show up. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to identify factors associated with no-show. County-level mapping was used to identify patterns in no-show rates. RESULTS: eClinic patients had twice the odds of no-show compared to traditional clinic (p<0.001). Age was inversely proportional to odds of no-show with each additional decade associated with a 16% decrease in these odds (p<0.001). African-American patients have greater odds of no-show compared to Caucasian patients (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.95-3.13, p<0.001). Marital statuses of single and legal separation were associated with higher odds of no-show compared to married marital status (p<0.001 and p=0.04, respectively). Minimally-invasive and endocrine surgery clinics had lower odds of no-show compared with acute care surgery clinic (p<0.001 for both). County-level no-show rates demonstrate similar patterns between clinic settings. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors are associated with increased odds of no-show including the visit being in eClinic.

Eye banks globally have developed varying guidelines and criteria for evaluating the viability of donor corneas. Variables such as the age of the donor, medical history, and potential disease transmission are important screening parameters. While known infectious diseases may be transmissible through the cornea, emerging infectious diseases that are not well studied may be more transmissible than other infections. In particular, coronavirus has impacted corneal transplantation as SARS-CoV-2 expression has been detected in corneal tissue and conjunctiva. In recent years, partial-thickness corneal transplantations have been introduced.

PrP ligands could theoretically antagonize prion formation by protecting the native protein from misfolding or by targeting it for degradation, but no validated small-molecule binders have been discovered to date. We deployed a variety of screening methods in an effort to discover binders of PrP, including 19F-observed and saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), DNA-encoded library selection, and in silico screening. A single benzimidazole compound was confirmed in concentration-response, but affinity was very weak (Kd > 1 mM), and it could not be advanced further. The exceptionally low hit rate observed here suggests that PrP is a difficult target for small-molecule binders. While orthogonal binder discovery methods could yield high affinity compounds, non-small-molecule modalities may offer independent paths forward against prion disease.","output":"Multimodal small-molecule screening for human prion protein binders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously demonstrated that adaptation of an embryo-attenuated infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Arkansas (Ark) Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI)-derived vaccine to chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells (CEKp7) shifted the virus population towards homogeneity in spike (S) and nonstructural protein genes. Moreover, the typical Ark vaccine subpopulations emerging in chickens vaccinated with commercial Ark vaccines were not detected in chickens vaccinated with CEKp7, indicating that kidney-cell adaptation drastically increased the stability of the vaccine virus population in chickens. In the current study both conventional and next-generation sequencing results show that the changes achieved during CEK adaptation remained after five back passages in embryonated chicken egg (ECE).

In a second protection trial, protection by CEKp7e2 was compared with protection conferred by an attenuated commercial ArkDPI-derived vaccine different from that which the CEK-adapted virus originated. All vaccinated chicken groups showed a significant reduction of respiratory signs and viral load after Ark virulent challenge compared to unvaccinated-challenged controls. In CEKp7e2 vaccinated chickens viral subpopulations different from the challenge virus were detected after challenge in a marginal number (7%-8%) of chickens.

To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease trajectories termed patient archetypes, whose temporal dynamics are reflected in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

These protein domains are essentially the main components of globular proteins and are the most principal level at which protein function and protein interactions can be understood. An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy. In this review, we aim to describe the basic concepts of protein domain evolution and illustrate recent developments in molecular evolution that have provided valuable new insights in the field of comparative genomics and protein interaction networks.","output":"The Nature of Protein Domain Evolution: Shaping the Interaction Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomarkers for COVID-19 are urgently needed.

Modern qPCR instruments are capable of detecting 4-6 analytes in a single sample: one per optical detection channel. However, many clinical applications require multiplexing beyond this traditional single-well capacity, including the task of simultaneously testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. This can be addressed by dividing a sample across multiple wells, or using technologies such as genomic sequencing and spatial arrays, but at the expense of significantly higher cost and lower throughput compared with single-well qPCR. These trade-offs represent unacceptable compromises in high-throughput screening scenarios such as SARS-CoV-2 testing. We demonstrate a novel method of detecting up to 20 targets per well with standard qPCR instrumentation: high-definition PCR (HDPCR). HDPCR combines TaqMan chemistry and familiar workflows with robust encoding to enable far higher levels of multiplexing on a traditional qPCR system without an increase in cost or reduction in throughput. We utilize HDPCR with a custom 20-Plex assay, an 8-Plex assay using unmodified predesigned single-plex assays from Integrated DNA Technologies and a 9-Plex pathogen panel inclusive of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. All three assays were successful when tested on a variety of samples, with overall sample accuracies of 98.8, 98.3, and 100%, respectively.

Proponents claim that this could have benefits for society, such as building herd immunity and ensuring that critical workers won't be incapacitated during the peak of the infection. They also claim that this could have benefits for individuals, such as being safely exempted from lockdown measures and (for individuals who are likely to be infected anyway) ensuring that the infection happens under relatively less dangerous conditions. Some respond that CVI would unethical. Here, I argue that, while CVI may or may not be ill-advised for empirical reasons, there are no in-principle ethical objections to it (i.e., if CVI would work as well as its proponents think, it would be ethical to implement it). I present three arguments for this conclusion. The first is an argument from informed consent: informed consent to relevantly similar medical procedures renders performing these procedures permissible, so informed consent to CVI would render it permissible. The second is an argument from reasonable beneficence: it draws on recent work by Caspar Hare on relevantly similar choices to argue that CVI is permissible.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative research to examine the changes in food choice for US university students due to COVID-19 and offer insight into why these changes occurred. Students in this study reported significant, and often negative, changes in food choices during the pandemic compared to when on campus.

We found food availability and household roles to be powerful factors influencing food choices. Most students had returned to family homes with many students taking a passive role in activities that shape food choices. Parents usually purchased groceries and prepared meals with students eating foods made available to them. Increased free time contributed to boredom and snacking for some students, while for a few students with increased skills and/or agency, additional free time was used to plan and prepare meals. About a third of the students attributed eating different foods at home to food availability issues related to the pandemic such as groceries being out of stock, purchasing non-perishable foods, or the inability to get to a store.

Based on these insights, the paper reflects on the lessons that are learned for the future of short-term rentals. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative multi-method small-scale case study, which relies on in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion carried out with a group of hosts affiliated to the Airbnb Host Community in Aarhus, Denmark. Informed by an interpretivist approach, the study aims to make sense of people's subjective experiences with hosting on the Airbnb platform, and how they have continued and adapted their hospitality practices during the pandemic. Findings: Participants' adaptive practices vary according to their motivations to host and the type of accommodation that they rent out. Although all hosts in this study now implement more intensive cleaning practices, hosts who stay with their guests onsite tend to take stricter preventative measures to avoid contamination and transmission of the virus in their social interactions with guests. On the contrary, hosts who rent out their entire properties and have minimal contact with their guests found themselves less affected by the pandemic's impacts and have had a continued demand for their properties. Social implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has unevenly affected Airbnb hosts. Hosts who share their homes with guests require different adaptations to their daily behaviour and cleaning practices at home than hosts who do not stay with their guests and rent out entire properties. However, unlike professional hosts who largely or solely rely on Airbnb for their income, occasional home-sharing hosts tend to be more flexible in coping with cancelled or fewer bookings. Originality/value: This study provides novel insights into the uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on participants in the platform economies of tourism.

CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","output":"Understanding and Promoting Racial Diversity in Healthcare Settings to Address Disparities in Pandemic Crisis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Limited data imply an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness level and the rates of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The purpose of this study was to monitor URTI symptoms and severity in a heterogeneous group of community adults and contrast across tertiles of physical activity and fitness levels while adjusting for potential confounders. DESIGN A group of 1002 adults (ages 18-85 years, 60% female, 40% male) were followed for 12 weeks during the winter and fall seasons while monitoring URTI symptoms and severity using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey. Subjects reported frequency of aerobic activity, and rated their physical fitness level using a 10-point Likert scale. A general linear model, with adjustment for seven confounders, was used to examine the effect of exercise frequency and fitness level on the number of days with URTI and severity of symptoms. RESULTS The number of days with URTI during the 12-week period was significantly reduced, 43% in subjects reporting  5 days/week aerobic exercise compared to those who were largely sedentary ( 1 day/week) and 46% when comparing subjects in the high versus low fitness tertile. URTI severity and symptomatology were also reduced 32% to 41% between high and low aerobic activity and physical fitness tertiles.

This study explores the impact of the Australian 2019/20 bushfires followed by the COVID-19 pandemic on unintentional coastal drowning fatalities. Fatality data were collated using triangulation methodology. Percentage change in coastal drowning fatalities between 2019/20 financial year (FY) and the 15FY annual average (2004/5C2018/19) were calculated for the dominant bushfire period (August 2019CFebruary 2020 inclusive) and COVID-19 restrictions in place for 2019/20FY (MarchCJune 2020 inclusive). Relative risk (RR; with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of coastal drowning was calculated against the average for overall, bushfire and COVID-19 periods, using coastal participation data as the denominator, weighted for the predicted decrease in the use of outdoor coastal areas due to these widespread events. Coastal drowning fatalities increased in 2019/20FY by 9% overall (bushfires: 6%; COVID-19: 9%). Swimming/wading drowning fatalities increased during the bushfire period (RR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.13C3.63), while boating and personal watercraft (PWC)-related fatalities increased during both the bushfire (RR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.41C6.05) and COVID-19 period (RR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.64C9.11).

The need for such a process to assist in the implementation of app evaluation across all medical fields is evident. Such a process has the potential to increase stakeholder engagement and catalyze interest and engagement with present-day app evaluation models. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and pilot test the Technology Evaluation and Assessment Criteria for Health apps (TEACH-apps). METHODS: Tailoring a well-known implementation framework, Replicating Effective Programs, we present a new process to approach the challenges faced in implementing app evaluation tools today. As a culmination of our experience implementing this process and feedback from stakeholders, we present the four-part process to aid the implementation of mobile health technology. This paper outlines the theory, evidence, and initial versions of the process. RESULTS: The TEACH-apps process is designed to be broadly usable and widely applicable across all fields of health. The process comprises four parts: (1) preconditions (eg, gathering apps and considering local needs), (2) preimplementation (eg, customizing criteria and offering digital skills training), (3) implementation (eg, evaluating apps and creating educational handouts), and (4) maintenance and evolution (eg, repeating the process every 90 days and updating content). TEACH-apps has been tested internally at our hospital, and there is growing interest in partnering health care facilities to test the system at their sites. CONCLUSIONS: This implementation framework introduces a process that equips stakeholders, clinicians, and users with the foundational tools to make informed decisions around app use and increase app evaluation engagement. The application of this process may lead to the selection of more culturally appropriate and clinically relevant tools in health care.","output":"Technology Evaluation and Assessment Criteria for Health Apps (TEACH-Apps): Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To understand how the public discourse around food assistance and social responsibility evolved during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing news coverage. Methods: We conducted an ethnographic content analysis of news articles and photographs about food insecurity or food assistance published by U.S. newspapers and wire services between December 1, 2019, and November 30, 2020. We analyzed a random sample of 241 articles and 223 photographs to assess how they depicted food assistance programs, the program participants, and whether they included cues for deservingness. Results: Before the pandemic, news about food assistance was dominated by stories about abuse and fraud. Once COVID-19 began, news coverage contained cues known to engender beliefs about the deservingness of people receiving assistance. During the pandemic, news also highlighted misconceptions about food assistance programs, called for policy changes to reduce logistical barriers, and described the plight of families and other people like us in need of food assistance. Discussion: News coverage during the pandemic cued audience empathy, highlighted the logistical strains faced by food assistance programs, and elevated values of government accountability. The narrative about society's obligation to care for communities in need can be transferred to other safety net programs that protect the public's health. Health Equity Implications: As the pandemic evolves, public health leaders can maintain the narrative about the importance of food assistance and expand the characteristics of this narrative to challenge well-entrenched, but false, narratives about those who need help.","output":"People Like Us: News Coverage of Food Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to compare the concentration of surgical smoke produced by different tissues and electric diathermy modes and to measure the effectiveness of various local exhaust ventilations.

The repositioning of existing drugs is one possible effective strategy for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. We previously showed that vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury is dependent upon endothelial HIF-1/FoxM1 signaling. The aim of this study was to identify a candidate inducer of HIF-1/FoxM1 signaling for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. Employing high throughput screening of a library of 1200 FDA-approved drugs by using hypoxia response element (HRE)-driven luciferase reporter assays, we identified Rabeprazole (also known as Aciphex) as a top HIF- activator. In cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells, Rabeprazole induced HIF1A mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-response study of Rabeprazole in a mouse model of endotoxemia-induced inflammatory lung injury identified a dose that was well tolerated and enhanced vascular repair and the resolution of inflammatory lung injury. Rabeprazole treatment resulted in reductions in lung vascular leakage, edema, and neutrophil sequestration and proinflammatory cytokine expression during the repair phrase. We next used Hif1a/Tie2Cre knockout mice and Foxm1/Tie2Cre knockout mice to show that Rabeprazole promoted vascular repair through HIF-1/FoxM1 signaling. In conclusion, Rabeprazole is a potent inducer of HIF-1 that promotes vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury via endothelial HIF-1/FoxM1 signaling.

Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Tertiary-care, academic medical center in Nashville, TN. Patients: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure admitted to the adult ICU without venous thromboembolism at the time of ICU admission. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was development of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism was defined by clinical imaging or autopsy, demonstrating deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Forty consecutive critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were enrolled; 37 (92.5%) were hypercoagulable by at least one thromboelastography parameter at the time of ICU admission and 12 (30%) met the primary outcome of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Patients who developed venous thromboembolism had decreased measures of clotting (maximum amplitude, alpha angle, shear elastic modulus parameter, and clotting index) on ICU admission thromboelastography compared with patients who did not develop venous thromboembolism (p < 0.05 for all measures). For each individual thromboelastography parameter used to dichotomize patients as hypercoagulable, the rate of venous thromboembolism was not higher in those identified as hypercoagulable; in fact, the venous thromboembolism rate was higher in patients who were not hypercoagulable by thromboelastography for maximum amplitude (p = 0.04) and alpha angle (p = 0.001). Platelet count was positively correlated with maximum amplitude, alpha angle, G parameter, and clotting index, and significantly lower in patients who developed venous thromboembolism than those who did not (median 186 vs 278 103/L, p = 0.046). Venous thromboembolism was associated with inhospital mortality (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.4-29; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our data do not support the use of thromboelastography to risk stratify critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 for the development of venous thromboembolism or to guide decisions about anticoagulation.

Mucormycosis is a fatal fungal infection and understanding the associated risk factors and their management plays a key role to reduce mortality and morbidity caused due to such infections. This systematic review was conducted to assess the risk factors, clinical characteristics and to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) affecting the head-and-neck region. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched with the keywords;((Mucormycosis) OR (invasive fungal sinusitis)) AND (COVID-19) and the PRISMA chart was prepared for the selection of the reports based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 261 cases of CAM affecting the head-and-neck region were analyzed in this systematic review. Most of the patients presented with rhino-orbital/rhino-orbito-cerebral form of mucormycosis (rhino-orbital mucormycosis/rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis). Pulmonary mucormycosis along with rhino-orbital form, involvement of hard palate, and maxillary sinus was seen in one case each. A total of 224 (85.8%) patients were diabetic, 68 (30.3%) of them had poor glycemic control. Steroids were administered in 210 (80.4%) patients. Except for two, antifungal treatment was given to all patients. Follow-up data revealed 67 (25.6%) deaths and 193 (73.9%) were alive with one patient lost during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review suggested that the occurrence of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients is related to the inherent effects of COVID-19 infection on the immune system, comorbidities especially diabetes, and treatment aspects. Hence, a detailed understanding of these factors may aid in the personalized management of CAM and improve the disease outcome. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: The risk factors in patients affected by CAM should be recognized and closely monitored in post-COVID-19 patients.

UVA was performed in two layers, using a unidirectional barbed suture fashioned into a double-ended stitch. Perioperative outcomes and 30-day complications were recorded. RESULTS All anastomoses were performed without assistance and without tying a knot. Median time for entire dual-layer anastomosis was 14.0 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 12-20) and that for urethrovesical anastomosis was 11 minutes (IQR: 9-15). Not having to rely on an assistant to follow the suture decreased instrument clashes, entangling of the suture around an instrument, and made the anastomosis faster. Eight patients underwent anterior/lateral reconstruction of the bladder neck, and there were no leaks on cystography at 1 week.

To address the second aim we used fixed effects model by means of a multilevel approach, a linear model that considers dependency in the data.Results: Self-perceived job performance deteriorated across time. From the first measurement to the four-month follow-up, more health care workers presented common mental disorders (40% vs 45.57%), depression, and/or anxiety (52.46% vs 62.62%). A meaningful worsening of mental health was observed in healthcare workers who expressed concern about being infected with COVID-19, whether asymptomatic (greater general discomfort and psychological distress) or symptomatic (greater general discomfort). Likewise, there were significant interactions between a history of mental disorder and concern about COVID-19 infection.Conclusions: Among healthcare workers, the uncertainty about the COVID-19 infection may have larger negative mental health impacts than actually being infected.","output":"A Longitudinal Study on the Changes in Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is common and potentially fatal in patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PMBT). However, few data are available regarding its precipitating factors and prognosis. We sought to: (1) compare the causes of ARF and the outcome between patients with PMBT and patients with other peripheral solid tumors (PST), (2) identify the factors influencing ICU survival in PMBT patients. METHODS Two-center retrospective case-control study from March 1996 to May 2014. Primary central nervous system lymphomas were also included. RESULTS Eighty-four patients with PMBT and 133 patients with PST were included. Acute infectious pneumonia was more frequent in PMBT than PST patients (77 vs. 36%, p < 0.001). Pulmonary embolism was also more frequent in PMBT patients (13% vs. 5%, p = 0.042), while cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure were more frequent in PST patients (37 vs. 10%, p < 0.001). Among acute infectious pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia were more frequent in PMBT patients (19 vs. 2%, p < 0.001 and 19 vs. 8%, p < 0.001, respectively). ICU mortality was similar between PMBT and PST patients (24% vs. 24%, p = 0.966). In multivariate analysis, cancer progression (OR 7.25 95% CI 1.13-46.45, p = 0.034), need for intubation (OR 7.01 95% CI 1.29-38.54, p = 0.022), were independently associated with ICU mortality in PMBT patients. CONCLUSIONS The cause of ARF in patients with PMBT differs significantly than those with PST and up to 50% may have been prevented. Mortality did not differ between the two groups. These results suggest that PMBT alone is not a relevant criterion for ICU recusal.","output":"Etiology and prognosis of acute respiratory failure in patients with primary malignant brain tumors admitted to the intensive care unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B Conclusions: b Patients on RAAS inhibitors prior to hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher mortality and complications than those not on these medications.

The recent development of AAV-PHP.eB, highly BBB-permeable capsid variant of AAV serotype 9, has opened up systemic application for whole brain transduction. To attain high transduction efficacy, much efforts have been paid to purify AAV vectors using gradient centrifugation or column chromatography. These methods are time-consuming, cost substantially and require expensive equipment. NEW METHOD: We propose a simple purification method for the production of systemically applicable AAV-PHP.eB targeting the brain. The new method, which we named minimal purification (MP) method, requires only 2 steps: removal of cell debris using a syringe filter and concentration using a disposable ultrafiltration device. RESULTS: The MP method yielded 2 times more AAV-PHP.eB than the standard ultracentrifuge purification (UCP) method. Intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.eB prepared using the MP method caused robust whole brain transduction without overt toxicity on the liver and kidney. Moreover, we found almost no difference in cellular density and morphology of brain microglia between control mice and mice treated systemically with the MP viral solution, suggesting no influence of the viral injection on brain immunity. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The new method, which requires only a benchtop centrifuge and takes only 2-4a?h to obtain a ready-to-use viral solution, is much less expensive than the existing UCP method, and can avoid cumbersome and time-consuming purification processes. CONCLUSIONS: This simplified method further expands the use of AAV vectors in the neuroscience community.","output":"Efficient whole brain transduction by systemic infusion of minimally purified AAV-PHP.eB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Less than a year has passed since the start of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 First published research results demonstrate a frequent increase in glycemia in patients without previously diagnosed carbohydrate metabolism disorders A possible relationship between the carbohydrate metabolism state and the course of COVID-19 is considered AIM: To identify the incidence of known and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and evaluate the relationship between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), inflammation markers and infectious disease severity METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective study included 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral polysegmental viral pneumonia hospitalized in the Endocrinology Research Centre, Russian Federation Diagnosis of carbohydrate metabolism disorders was based on the HbA1c level, blood glucose level at admission (BGA) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) Patients were divided into 2 groups: without the previously diagnosed DM (n=129, 83 3%) and with known history of DM (n=26, 16,7%) Patients without previously diagnosed DM were divided into subgroups according to HbA1c levels: 6,0% (Group A), &gt;6,0% HbA1c, &lt;6 5% (Group B), 6,5% (Group C) Additionally, insulin, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were measured in all patients Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulsoximetry, computerized tomography of lungs with calculation of lung parenchyma damage percentage RESULTS: Type 2 DM was previously established in 16 7% of all included patients Among patients without DM history, DM was revealed in 8 patients (5 2%), based on HbA1c, FPG and BGA In 66 patients (42 6%) we observed no changes in carbohydrate metabolism In 55 patients, the interpretation of carbohydrate metabolism state was difficult due to inconsistency of HbA1c level with FPG and BGA: In particular, the level of HbA1c  6 5% (which corresponds to the diagnostic threshold of the DM) was detected in 19 patients (12,2%) with normal FPG and BGA No true stress hyperglycemia on admission and according to FPG was reported Despite the presence of confirmed DM, HbA1c levels positively correlated with inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, IL-6) and SpO2 Patients with a HbA1c 6 5% without DM history had the most severe course of the disease: Longest duration of hospitalization, largest damage of the pulmonary tissue, and high lethality CONCLUSION: The incidence of DM among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 21 9% (16 7% had previous diagnosis of DM, 5 2% - newly diagnosed), which is 1 5 times higher than in general population in a comparable age category It is difficult to assess the carbohydrate metabolism disorders in patients in acute infectious period An increased level of HbA1c (6 5%), first detected in the acute period of infection, in combination with normal FPG and BGA parameters, cannot be a diagnostic criterion and requires dynamic monitoring HbA1c level can be considered as a predictive factor of COVID-19 severity, independent of DM","output":"High level of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) in patients with covid-19 is a marker of the severity of the infection but not an indicator of previous diabetes mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01).

To understand the benefits and impact of the DRCs, this study was aimed at exploring the DRC members' perception about the role and benefits of the newly developed facility-based DRCs in five pilot hospitals in Jordan, to assess women empowerment, decision-making process, power dynamics, culture and genderism as contributing factors for deaths, and impact of COVID-19 lockdown on births. Methods: A descriptive study of a qualitative design-using focus group discussions-was conducted after one year of establishing DRCs in 5 pilot large hospitals. The number of participants in each focus group ranged from 8 to10, and the total number of participants was 45 HCPs (nurses and doctors). Questions were consecutively asked in each focus group. The moderator asked the main questions from the guide and then used probing as needed. A second researcher observed the conversation and took field notes. Results: Overall, there was an agreement among the majority of DRC members across all hospitals that the DRC was successful in identifying the exact cause of neonatal deaths and stillbirths as well as associated modifiable factors. There was also a consensus that the DRC contributed to an improvement in health services provided for pregnant women and newborns as well as protecting human rights and enabling women to be more interdependent in taking decisions related to family planning. Moreover, the DRC agreed that a proportion of the neonatal deaths and stillbirths occurring in the hospitals could have been prevented if adequate antenatal care was provided and some traditional harmful practices were avoided. Conclusions: Facility-based neonatal death review audit is practical and can be used to identify exact causes of maternal and neonatal deaths and is a valuable tool for hospital quality indicators.

Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been found to be critical in priming the viral spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor before the virus enters into the host cell. Recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that Alpha 1 antitrypsin (encoded by SERPINA1 gene) is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and provided support to the already approved therapy as a candidate for COVID-19. Interestingly Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is common among Europeans. Here we have provided in silico evidence that Alpha 1 antitrypsin can interact with TMPRSS2 and both of them are co-expressed in the human liver and lung. We then analyzed the gnomAD dataset to show that Europeans and Latinos have a substantially higher carrier frequency of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (~12%) compared to other large ethnicities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency might be a risk factor for severe infection with SARS-CoV-2.

AIMS We aimed to perform a uniform assessment of the global burden of IBS using data from Google Trends, a novel, online tool. METHODS Google Trends measures popularity of a search term in a given week compared to popularity of all search terms in that week, calculated as relative search volume (RSV). We compiled data on the popularity of IBS and its treatments across 173 countries between 2014 and 2018. We compared Google Trends popularity for IBS with prior epidemiological prevalence data, while controlling for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and physician density. RESULTS Of the 173 countries with Google Trends data, 137 countries also had data for GDP per capita and physician density. Worldwide popularity of IBS as a search topic increased from 79 to 89 (13% increase by RSV) over the 5-year period between 2014 and 2018. Country-specific change in IBS RSV ranged from - 35% (Nigeria) to + 64% (Pakistan). There was poor correlation between the Google Trends data and prior epidemiological data (0.08, Pearson correlation, p = 0.64).

If this matrix is enhanced by being interpreted as a probabilistic Universe of Discourse, it still suffers from two inter-related shortcomings, arising from lack of length/area proportionality and a potential misconception concerning a false assumption of independence between the two underlying events. This paper remedies these two shortcomings by modifying this matrix into a new Karnaugh-map-like diagram that resembles an eikosogram. Furthermore, the paper suggests the use of a pair of functionally complementary versions of this diagram to handle any ternary problem of conditional probability. The two diagrams split the unknowns and equations between themselves in a fashion that allows the use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle such a problem. The method of solution is demonstrated via four examples, in which the solution might be arithmetic or algebraic, and independently might be numerical or symbolic. In particular, we provide a symbolic arithmetic derivation of the well-known formulas that express the predictive values in terms of prevalence, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we prove a virtually unknown interdependence among the two predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. In fact, we employ a method of symbolic algebraic derivation to express any one of these four indicators in terms of the other three.

Our previous study revealed a higher unbound concentration of DHC in the heart than plasma of mice after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or DHC, but the underlying uptake mechanism remains unelucidated. In our investigations, we studied the transport mechanism of DHC in transgenic cells, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and animal experiments. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, we found that uptake transporters expressed in the mouse heart include organic cation transporter 1/3 (OCT1/3) and carnitine/organic cation transporter 1/2 (OCTN1/2). The accumulation experiments in transfected cells showed that DHC was a substrate of OCT1 and OCT3, with Km of 11.29 {plus minus} 2.0 and 8.96 {plus minus} 3.3 M, respectively, but not a substrate of OCTN1/2. Additionally, a higher efflux level (1.71-fold of MDCK-mock) of DHC was observed in MDCK-MDR1 cells than in MDCK-mock cells. Therefore, DHC is a weak substrate for MDR1. Studies using primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed that OCT1/3 inhibitors (quinidine, decynium-22, and levo-tetrahydropalmatine) prevented the accumulation of DHC, while OCTN2 inhibitors (mildronate and l-carnitine) did not affect its accumulation. Moreover, the co-administration of OCT1/3 inhibitors (levo-tetrahydropalmatine, THP) decreased the concentration of DHC in the mouse heart. Based on these findings, DHC may be accumulated partly by OCT1/3 transporters and excreted by MDR1 in the heart. THP could alter the distribution of DHC in the mouse heart. Significance Statement We reported the cardiac transport mechanism of dehydrocorydaline, highly distributed to the heart after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or dehydrocorydaline only. Dehydrocorydaline (an OCT1/3 and MDR1 substrate) accumulation in primary cardiomyocytes may be related to the transport activity of OCT1/3. This ability, hampered by selective inhibitors (THP, an inhibitor of OCT1/3), causes nearly 40% reduction in exposure of the heart to dehydrocorydaline. These results suggest that OCT1/3 may contribute to the uptake of dehydrocorydaline in the heart.","output":"Organic cation transporter 1 and 3 contribute to the high accumulation of dehydrocorydaline in the heart."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in March 2020 in Europe, which is normally the peak incidence period of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections, implying cocirculation and potentially causing competition between them. METHODS We investigated differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of HMPV infections in hospitalized patients before (January 2016-28 February, 2020) and HMPV and COVID-19 during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (28 February, 2020-1 April, 2020). RESULTS A total of 239 HMPV patients and 303 COVID-19 patients were included. Incidence of HMPV peaked in March. Despite a 324% increase in HMPV testing during the COVID-19 outbreak, incidence of HMPV remained stable. Clinical characteristics showed 25 (11%) ICU admissions and 14 (6%) deaths. History of myocardial infarction, higher age and lower BMI were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Clinical characteristics of HMPV-infected patients did not differ between the non-COVID-19 period and the examined COVID-19 period except for length of hospital stay (7 vs. 5 days). HMPV infection and COVID-19 shared many clinical features but HMPV was associated with female gender, elderly patients and chronic conditions (COPD and chronic heart failure). Clinical outcomes did not differ between the viruses during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS The clinical impact of HMPV infection did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of incidence and/or disease severity; hence, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2 are probably co-circulating independently.

Currently, only one ongoing clinical trial (NCT04276987) is specifically exploring the use of MSC-derived exosomes as a therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. The purpose of this review is to provide insights of using exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells in management of the co-morbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in direction of improving their health outcome. There is limited knowledge of using exosomes in SARS-CoV-2; the clinicians and researchers should exploit exosomes as therapeutic regime.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Exhibit Promising Potential for Treating SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter is an interview with Dr Wilson Wong.

In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2,842 adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State from March 21 2020 through June 2020. Early in the pandemic we instituted a policy to collect data on patient occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years, 53% male) 193 (6.8%) were HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) were not HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 [61%] vs 1211/2649 [46%], P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 [83%] vs 946/2649 [36%], P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12/193 [6%] vs 426/2649 [16%], P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 [8%] vs 564/2649 [21%], P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38/193 [20%] vs 1189/2649 [45%], P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 [3%] vs 532/2649 [20%], P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154/193 (80%) vs 1275/2649 (48%) p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 [20%] vs 1264/2694 [47%], P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 [3%] vs 321/2694 [12%], P<0.001), need for IMV (6/193 [3%] vs 321/2694 [12%], P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 [1%] vs 219/2694 [8%], P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and were less likely to be admitted.","output":"Comparison of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is usually based on clinical and radiological criteria.

Yet, mixed empirical findings suggest that telework arrangements do not uniformly result in less interrole interference (i.e., work-home and home-work interference). Applying and extending a border theory perspective, the present research offers insight into what factors may predict interrole interference, mediating mechanisms that may explain why such interference occurs, and a moderator that tests for whom interference is most damaging when employees work from home. Specifically, we test cross-role interruption behaviors as a predictor of interrole interference, with recovery experiences as a mediator of this relation and work-life border segmentation preference as a moderator. A sample of 504 home-based teleworkers recruited through Amazons Mechanical Turk participated in a three-wave survey. Results from a structural equation modeling approach support our overall model. However, the extent and valence of the impact of cross-role interruption behaviors had on teleworkers interrole interference depended on the direction of the interruption, type of recovery experience, and personal work-life border preference. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights that may help explain the gap between expected and actual occurrence of interrole interference in home-based telework arrangements.","output":"The What, Why and Whom of Interrole Interference Among Home-Based Teleworkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This opinion article results from a collective analysis by the Editorial Board of Food Security. It is motivated by the ongoing covid-19 global epidemic, but expands to a broader view on the crises that disrupt food systems and threaten food security, locally to globally. Beyond the public health crisis it is causing, the current global pandemic is impacting food systems, locally and globally. Crises such as the present one can, and do, affect the stability of food production. One of the worst fears is the impacts that crises could have on the potential to produce food, that is, on the primary production of food itself, for example, if material and non-material infrastructure on which agriculture depends were to be damaged, weakened, or fall in disarray. Looking beyond the present, and not minimising its importance, the covid-19 crisis may turn out to be the trigger for overdue fundamental transformations of agriculture and the global food system. This is because the global food system does not work well today: the number of hungry people in the world has increased substantially, with the World Food Programme warning of the possibility of a hunger pandemic. Food also must be nutritious, yet unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death. Deepening crises impoverish the poorest, disrupt food systems, and expand food deserts. A focus on healthy diets for all is all the more relevant when everyones immune system must react to infection during a global pandemic. There is also accumulating and compelling evidence that the global food system is pushing the Earth system beyond the boundaries of sustainability. In the past twenty years, the growing demand for food has increasingly been met through the destruction of Earths natural environment, and much less through progress in agricultural productivity generated by scientific research, as was the case during the two previous decades. There is an urgent need to reduce the environmental footprint of the global food system: if its performances are not improved rapidly, the food system could itself be one main cause for food crises in the near future. The article concludes with a series of recommendations intended for policy makers and science leaders to improve the resilience of the food system, global to local, and in the short, medium and long term.","output":"Mapping disruption and resilience mechanisms in food systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy responses to COVID-19 have illuminated how children and young peoples human rights were all too often side-lined by adult concerns.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS: Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P < 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients' quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.","output":"Prospective Analysis Regarding Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) between Morbid Obese Patients Following Bariatric Surgery Versus on a Waiting List"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores Hungarian university students' autonomous learning behaviors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary (March-June 2020).

PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop the Parental Attitude Scale-Protecting Children during COVID-19 (PAS-CV19S) and assess its psychometric properties. This study also aimed to determine the relationship between parental attitudes about COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this methodological and correlational study, parents of children ages 6 to 18 years old were included (N = 402). The PAS-CV19S was developed for this study. The study collected data using an online sociodemographic form, a fear of COVID-19 scale, and the PAS-CV19S. The Cronbach alpha coefficient, confirmatory factor analysis, and explanatory factor analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of PAS-CV19S. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 scale and the PAS-CV19S. RESULTS: The PAS-CV19S is a valid and reliable scale consisting of three factors (general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors) as subdimensions. The Cronbach alpha of the PAS-CV19S overall was 0.90; the Cronbach alphas for the general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors subdimensions were 0.78, 0.80, and 0.92, respectively.

A crucial step in the treatment of tuberculosis is screening high risk populations and the early detection of the disease, with chest x-ray (CXR) imaging being the most widely-used imaging modality. As such, there has been significant recent interest in artificial intelligence-based TB screening solutions for use in resource-limited scenarios where there is a lack of trained healthcare workers with expertise in CXR interpretation. Motivated by this pressing need and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the use of computer-aided diagnosis of TB in place of a human reader, we introduce TB-Net, a self-attention deep convolutional neural network tailored for TB case screening. Methods: : We used CXR data from a multi-national patient cohort to train and test our models. A machine-driven design exploration approach leveraging generative synthesis was used to build a highly customized deep neural network architecture with attention condensers. Results: : We conducted an explainability-driven performance validation process to validate TB-Net's decision-making behaviour. Experiments on CXR data from a multi-national patient cohort showed that the proposed TB-Net is able to achieve accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of 99.86%/100.0%/99.71%. Radiologist validation was conducted on select cases by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of experience, respectively, and showed consistency between radiologist interpretation and critical factors leveraged by TB-Net for TB case detection for the case where radiologists identified anomalies. Conclusion: The proposed TB-Net not only achieves high tuberculosis case detection performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but also leverages clinically relevant critical factors in its decision making process. While not a production-ready solution, we hope that the open-source release of TB-Net as part of the COVID-Net initiative will support researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists in advancing this eld in the ght against this global public health crisis.","output":"TB-Net: A Tailored, Self-Attention Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design For Detection of Tuberculosis Cases From Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced Portuguese healthcare institutions to adapt management protocols and prioritize resources.

Traditionally, AMPK is a key energy regulator of cell growth and proliferation, host autophagy, stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, fatty acid -oxidation and host immune function. In this review, we highlight the modulation of host AMPK by various viruses under physiological conditions.

While there is strong evidence that bats are the animal source of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, there are many uncertainties around the epidemiology, the intermediate animal species, and potential animal routes of SARS-Cov-2 transmission to humans. While it has also long been known that coronaviruses circulate among different animal species, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, responsible for the pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome endemic in Middle Eastern countries in 2002C2003 and 2012 respectively, the way this pandemic is being managed tends to downplay or neglect the veterinary contribution, which is not in line with the One Health approach, if we consider that the genesis of the COVID-19 pandemic, likewise SARS and MERS lies on a close and interdependent links of humans, animals and the environment. To overcome this flaw, and to better operationalize the One Health approach, there are several lines of contributions the veterinary profession might provide to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the framework of interventions jointly concerted in the veterinary and medical domains, notably: the experience in dealing with past animal epidemics, the skills in conducting wildlife surveillance targeting emerging pathogens at risky hot spots, and with the aim to predict and prevent future pandemics, the laboratory support for the diagnosis and molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and human samples testing, and animal import risk assessment to define COVID-19 risk strategy for international air travel. The veterinary profession presents itself ontologically with a strong One Health accent and all the related valuable knowledge can be properly integrated within centralised multidisciplinary task-forces set up at the national and international level, with a renewed role in the management and monitoring structures required for managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The contribution of veterinary public health to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic from a One Health perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite possibly higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), there has been limited reporting of COVID-19 trends for this population. OBJECTIVE: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. METHODS: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. RESULTS: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall case-fatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1%) and without IDD (5.4%), these rates differed by age: ages &#8804;17 - IDD 1.6%, without IDD <0.01%; ages 18-74 - IDD 4.5%, without IDD 2.7%; ages &#8805;75- IDD 21.1%, without IDD, 20.7%.

It became evident that the pandemic was going to place a severe strain on all components of the U.S. healthcare system, and we needed to adapt our daily practices, training and education. In the present paper we discuss four pillars to face a pandemic: surgical and outpatients service, tele-medicine and tele-education. In the face of unprecedented risks in providing adequate health care to our patients during this current, evolving public health crisis of COVID-19, alternative patient management tools such as telemedicine services, allow clinicians to maintain necessary patient rapport with their healthcare provider when required. As a subspecialty, urology should take full advantage of telehealth and teleeducation at this juncture. As tele-urology and tele-education can obviate the potential drawbacks of social distancing as it pertains to healthcare, the platform can also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, without compromising quality urological care and educational efforts. Telehealth can bring urologists and their patients together, perhaps closer than ever.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 on the urology service in United States: perspectives and strategies to face a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerged Omicron SARS-CoV-2 has 3 distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3.

The identification of Pg-activators is therefore an important step in understanding their functional mechanism and derives new therapies. METHODS: In this study, different computational methods for predicting plasminogen activator peptide sequences with high accuracy were investigated, including support vector machines (SVM) based on amino acid (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods used to predict different Pg-activators from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. RESULTS: Overall maximum accuracy, evaluated using the five-fold cross validation technique, was 88.37%, 84.32%, 87.61%, 85.63% in 0.87, 0.83,0.86 and 0.85 MCC with amino (AC) or dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods respectively. Through this study, we have found that the different subfamilies of Pg-activators are quite closely correlated in terms of amino, dipeptide, PSSM and Hybrid compositions. Therefore, our prediction results show that plasminogen activators are predictable with a high accuracy from their primary sequence. Prediction performance was also cross-checked by confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) analysis. A web server to facilitate the prediction of Pg-activators from primary sequence data was implemented. CONCLUSION: The results show that dipeptide, PSSM profile, and Hybrid based methods perform better than single amino acid composition (AC). Furthermore, we also have developed a web server, which predicts the Pg-activators and their classification (available online at http://mamsap.it.deakin.edu.au/plas_pred/home.html).

This point is assumed to be the time at which buffer systems become active, cause an adaptation to changes of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and annihilate a possible therapeutic effect. In this prospective interventional study in a neurosurgical ICU the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was increased to a target range of 55 mmHg for 120 min by modification of the respiratory minute volume (RMV) one time a day between day 4 and 14 in 12 mechanically ventilated poor-grade SAH-patients. Arterial blood gases were measured every 15 min. CBF and brain tissue oxygen saturation (StiO2) were the primary and secondary end points. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was controlled by an external ventricular drainage. Under continuous hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 53.17  5.07), CBF was significantly elevated between 15 and 120 min after the start of hypercapnia. During the course of the trial intervention, cardiac output also increased significantly. To assess the direct effect of hypercapnia on brain perfusion, the increase of CBF was corrected by the parallel increase of cardiac output. The maximum direct CBF enhancing effect of hypercapnia of 32% was noted at 45 min after the start of hypercapnia. Thereafter, the CBF enhancing slowly declined. No relevant adverse effects were observed. CBF and StiO2 reproducibly increased by controlled hypercapnia in all patients. After 45 min, the curve of CBF enhancement showed an inflection point when corrected by cardiac output. It is concluded that 45 min might be the optimum duration for a therapeutic use and may provide an optimal balance between the benefits of hypercapnia and risks of a negative rebound effect after return to normal ventilation parameters.Trial registration: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (AZ 230/14) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial-ID: NCT01799525).

Indeed, the co-evolution of network structures and compartment shares strongly shape the process of epidemic diffusion, especially in terms of its speed. Furthermore, I show that the timing and features of spatial-distancing policies may dramatically influence their effectiveness.","output":"Assessing the Impact of Social Network Structure on the Diffusion of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Generalized Spatial SEIRD Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the disease caused by Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and world current main public health problem, due to its easy transmissibility and multiple clinical presentations.

The study focused on the analysis of use and assessment of telemedicine by physicians working in the outpatient sector, considering the perspective of different disciplines during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: The anonymous cross-sectional online survey within the study COVID-GAMS was conducted from 16 November 2020 to 1 January 2021. General practitioners; cardiologists; gastroenterologists; paediatricians; gynaecologists; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists were randomly selected and invited to participate in the survey. At the same time, open recruitment to the online survey was conducted via the professional societies. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed based on the data of 1521 outpatient responding physicians. RESULTS: The use of telephone and video consultation increased during the pandemic. Regarding the frequency of use, physicians already using telephone/video consultations in March/April 2020 report an increase in such services. General medicine was associated with an increased use of telephone and video consultations than cardiology, gynaecology or ENT, and in the case of telephone consultations also compared to paediatrics. General practitioners assessed the subjective usefulness higher than gynaecology and ENT. And the self-reported proportion of patients receiving telemedical care was higher correlated with general medicine than all other disciplines. The location of the practice (rural vs. urban), type of practice (individual vs. group) and gender (male vs. female) were also shown to be significant influencing factors on the variables mentioned above. Barriers reported by physicians not using telemedicine were the lack of equivalence to face-to-face contact and perceived low demand from patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in the use of telemedicine, to varying degrees in the different specialities. Individual and structural factors lead to a reduced use of telemedicine and there are physicians and patients barriers that have prevented telephone and video consultations from gaining acceptance by physicians. All these factors must be addressed if telemedicine procedures are to be implemented widely.

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M pro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M pro could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 11 best selected ligands, namely ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as beta-carboline, alkaloids, and polyflavonoids, and all displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as other known ligands.

Two matched controls were selected for each isolated patient (n = 156 general cohort controls and n = 144 disease-specific cohort controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Quality-of-care measures encompassing processes, outcomes, and satisfaction. Adjustments for study cohort and patient demographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics were conducted using multivariable regression. RESULTS Isolated and control patients generally had similar baseline characteristics; however, isolated patients were twice as likely as control patients to experience adverse events during their hospitalization (31 vs 15 adverse events per 1000 days; P<.001). This difference in adverse events reflected preventable events (20 vs 3 adverse events per 1000 days; P<.001) as opposed to nonpreventable events (11 vs 12 adverse events per 1000 days; P =.98). Isolated patients were also more likely to formally complain to the hospital about their care than control patients (8% vs 1%; P<.001), to have their vital signs not recorded as ordered (51% vs 31%; P<.001), and more likely to have days with no physician progress note (26% vs 13%; P<.001).

Our key idea is to formulate this synthesis problem as one of synthesizing a per-instruction compiler for abstract register machines. Our core technical contribution is a new compiler metasketch that enables JitSynth to efficiently explore the resulting synthesis search space.

How ethically demanding situations are handled affects employees' moral stress and job satisfaction. AIM: Describe priority-setting dilemmas, moral distress and support experienced by nurses and physicians across medical specialties in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Norway. RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional hospital-based survey was conducted from 23 April to 11 May 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval granted by the Regional Research Ethics Committee in Western Norway (131421). FINDINGS: Among the 1606 respondents, 67% had experienced priority-setting dilemmas the previous two weeks. Healthcare workers who were directly involved in COVID-19 care, were redeployed or worked in psychiatry/addiction medicine experienced it more often. Although 59% of the respondents had seen adverse consequences due to resource scarcity, severe consequences were rare. Moral distress levels were generally low (2.9 on a 0-10 scale), but higher in selected groups (redeployed, managers and working in psychiatry/addiction medicine). Backing from existing collegial and managerial structures and routines, such as discussions with colleagues and receiving updates and information from managers that listened and acted upon feedback, were found more helpful than external support mechanisms. Priority-setting guidelines were also helpful. DISCUSSION: By including all medical specialties, nurses and physicians, and various institutions, the study provides information on how the COVID-19 mitigation also influenced those not directly involved in the COVID-19 treatment of patients. In the next stages of the pandemic response, support for healthcare professionals directly involved in outbreak-affected patients, those redeployed or those most impacted by mitigation strategies must be a priority.

Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation (IMT aka FMT) is the transfer of healthy screened donor stool to an affected recipient, and recent interest has focused on its impact on the reduction of invasive MDRO infection. OBJECTIVES To describe 'How to' establish a clinical IMT pathway for patients at risk of MDRO invasive infection, with special considerations for optimising administration and assessment of endpoints. SOURCES Expert guidelines and peer-reviewed clinical studies are encompassed and discussed. CONTENT IMT is offered to patients with MDROs detected on rectal or stool screening and either at risk of MDRO invasive infection due to altered immune status or those with recurrent MDRO-mediated invasive disease and considered at risk of further disease. Donor screening should include pathogens with theoretical or demonstrated risk of transmission (including MDROs themselves and SARS-CoV-2) to take into consideration the relative immunosuppressed state of potential recipients. Delivery of IMT occurs when the patient is free from active infection, but no additional antibiotics are indicated. If administered when future immunosuppression is to take place, IMT is aligned at least two weeks beforehand to ensure sufficient time for engraftment. Patients are followed up in terms of adverse effects from IMT and clinicians are advised to discuss with the IMT multidisciplinary team on choice of antibiotics if needed to take into consideration the impact upon the intestinal microbiome. Prevention of invasive disease is the primary measure of success, rather than using intestinal decolonisation as a binary outcome. Repeat IMT is considered case-by-case. IMPLICATIONS Future research areas should include randomised studies that consider clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness, and better understanding of mechanisms to identify markers of treatment success and functional components that could be used therapeutically.","output":"How to Adapt an Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation program to reduce the risk of invasive multidrug-resistant infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: New Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services waivers created a payment mechanism for hospital at home services.

In 2019, approximately 80% of breast cancers in the U.S. were diagnosed on screening examinations, with 76.4% of eligible Medicare patients undergoing screening at least every two years. Since the start of the pandemic, many women have been reluctant to seek elective screening mammography, even with the lifting of \\"lock-down\\". We describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer presentation at an academic medical center in a city hit hard by the pandemic. Materials and Methods: The institutional IRB-approved Breast Cancer Registry Database was queried for patients enrolled during two time periods, those undergoing first surgical procedure before the start of the pandemic (4/1/2019-3/31/2020) to those the year after the pandemic started (4/1/2020-3/31/2021). Elective cancer surgery was paused for 3 weeks, ending 4/20/2020, and access to routine breast care was limited for 3 months. Variables included age, method of detection, palpability, histologic subtype and staging, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, cancer specific treatments, and radiation uptake. Results: 349 patients were in the 2019 cohort;246 in the 2020 cohort. No differences in baseline characteristics, including age at presentation, nodal status, or operation type. Fewer cancers were detected on routine mammography post-COVID vs. pre-COVID. Increase in detection of breast cancer through self-Sexams in 2020 was seen compared to 2019. Palpability on presentation also increased. More patients were treated with neo-adjuvant therapy chemotherapy, and 36 of 45 (80%) eligible early-stage breast cancer patients accepted neoadjuvant hormonal therapy during the period that elective cancer surgery was on hold. Patients received radiation therapy less frequently during the pandemic. The proportion of patients diagnosed with invasive ductal cancers was higher in the 2020 cohort and the proportion of patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and for invasive lobular cancers (ILC) was lower. Conclusions: Patients at an academic New York City medical center presented with more palpable and invasive breast cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the preceding year, and fewer patients with DCIS and ILC, cancers typically detected following screening mammography. While stage migration with an increase in diagnosis of late stage cancers has been described, in our population the stage shift occurred in early stage breast cancer, with decreases in DCIS and increases in Stages I-II, with the higher stages III-IV essentially unchanged. This reflects the effect of delay in our previously highly-screened population, with an average screening delay of 3 + months, and many patients missing their yearly screening altogether. While many medical interactions during COVID-19 were via telemedicine, radiation therapy requires daily office visits, and fear of exposure contributed to the lower rate of radiation. Given the increase in invasiveness and stage of breast cancers diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study emphasizes the importance of screening for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, even in the face of a concurrent health crisis.","output":"Changes in breast cancer presentation during Covid-19: Experience in an Urban Academic Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) in patients in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in order to determine a guide for the empirical antibiotic treatment of MDRAB.

The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increase rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset are associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlate closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Although specific IgM-S/N become undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers have an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilize at relatively high levels over the 6 month observation period. At late time points, the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are still >70%.

Wheat supplies approximately one-fifth of the calories and protein for human diets. Vertical farming is a possible promising option for increasing future wheat production. Here we show that wheat grown on a single hectare of land in a 10-layer indoor vertical facility could produce from 700  40 t/ha (measured) to a maximum of 1,940  230 t/ha (estimated) of grain annually under optimized temperature, intensive artificial light, high CO2 levels, and a maximum attainable harvest index. Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system.

Methods: We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. Results: We evaluated 145 patients.

However, data on the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with kidney disease is limited, and the utility of an LFIA to test for antibodies in these patients has not been assessed. Study Design: Observational study. Setting & Participants: 60 patients (40 hemodialysis and 20 kidney transplant recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and 88 historic negative-control samples (collected before September 2019). Test: A commercially available LFIA to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with infection confirmed by viral RT-PCR testing. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG in dialysis patients and transplant recipients. Results: 56/58 (96.6%) patients (38/39 hemodialysis and 18/19 transplant recipients) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 5/7 (71.4%) patients who were negative on preliminary testing had detectable IgG when retested more than 21 days postdiagnosis. Median times to first and second tests after diagnosis were 17 (interquartile range, 15-20) and 35 (interquartile range, 30-39) days, respectively. Calculation of test characteristics gave sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI, 88.3%-99.4%) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 92.0-99.6%). Limitations: Possible exposure to other beta-coronaviruses that may cross-react with the antigen used in the LFIA cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Symptomatic dialysis patients and transplant recipients commonly develop an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected using an LFIA.

INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS The intervention was a five-part, 90-question online survey provided via e-mail invitation to New Jersey State Nursing Association members. Data were collected from June 25 to July 9, 2020. Descriptive statistics, frequency analyses, a Mann-Whitney test on nonparametric measures of groups by age, and a one-tailed t test were completed. Results of the Telehealth Readiness Assessment tool were calculated. Open-text responses were organized and used to illustrate the findings. RESULTS Fifty-two perinatal nurses responded to the survey. Twenty-two (42%) completed all 90 questions. Partial answers were accepted. Synchronous live telehealth expanded 66% in the wake of COVID-19. Results showed that 37% (n = 15) of participants used telehealth at work, and 27% (n = 11) used it in getting care for themselves or a family member (M = 2.0, SD = 0.86; one-tailed t test, p = .25).

As VR encompasses different modalities, tools, and applications, there is a need to explore how VR has been used in medical education. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to map existing research on the use of VR in undergraduate medical education and to identify areas of future research. METHODS: We performed a search of 4 bibliographic databases in December 2020. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction form. The study was conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and reported in line with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 114 included studies, 69 (60.5%) reported the use of commercially available surgical VR simulators. Other VR modalities included 3D models (15/114, 13.2%) and virtual worlds (20/114, 17.5%), which were mainly used for anatomy education. Most of the VR modalities included were semi-immersive (68/114, 59.6%) and were of high interactivity (79/114, 69.3%). There is limited evidence on the use of more novel VR modalities, such as mobile VR and virtual dissection tables (8/114, 7%), as well as the use of VR for nonsurgical and nonpsychomotor skills training (20/114, 17.5%) or in a group setting (16/114, 14%).

The effects of the ventilation and air-conditioning systems, opening windows and doors, and wearing masks are analyzed. Specific attention is made to the transport of sub-micron and micron-size particles relevant to typical respiratory droplets. High-resolution instrumentation was used to measure size distribution and aerosol response time on a University of Michigan campus bus under these different conditions. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to measure the airflow within the bus and evaluate risk. A risk metric was adopted based on the number of particles exposed to susceptible passengers. The flow that carries these aerosols is predominantly controlled by the ventilation system, which acts to uniformly distribute the aerosol concentration throughout the bus while simultaneously diluting it with fresh air. The opening of doors and windows was found to reduce the concentration by approximately one half, albeit its benefit does not uniformly impact all passengers on the bus due to recirculation of airflow caused by entrainment through windows.

Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included. We compared case numbers and treatment characteristics of pandemic (March 16 to May 15, 2020) and prepandemic (January 16 to March 15, 2020) cases and also with corresponding time period in 2019. RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for hospitalization of AIS (-17.4%), transient ischemic attack (-22.9%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (-15.8%) patients during the pandemic compared with prepandemic period. IVT rate in patients with AIS was comparable (prepandemic versus pandemic: 16.4% versus 16.6%, P=0.448), whereas mechanical thrombectomy rate was significantly higher during the pandemic (8.1% versus 7.7%, P=0.044). In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in patients with AIS during the pandemic period (8.1% versus 7.6%, P=0.006).

Secondary outcomes included examining laboratory and placental abnormalities among fetus-mother pairs. Methods: : Systematic review was performed on all studies reporting primary data on fetus-mother pairs with COVID-19. Data bases were searched for studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: : Final screening revealed 66 studies, from which the primary data of 1787 mother-infant pairs was obtained. Only 2.8% of mother infant pairs were tested positive, and this finding is identical to percentages reported in former coronaviridae outbreaks.

There have been studies showing the neuroprotective actions of these organosulfur compounds. However, the potential of these organosulfur compounds in neuropathic pain has not been explored. The present study was aimed at investigating the pain attenuating potential of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rats. The study also explored their pain-attenuating mechanisms through modulation of H2S, brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Methods The rats were subjected to CCI injury by ligating the sciatic nerve in four places. The development of neuropathic pain was measured by assessing mechanical hyperalgesia (Randall-Selittotest), mechanical allodynia (Von Frey test), and cold allodynia (acetone drop test) on 14th day after surgery. Results Administration of diallyl disulfide (25 and 50 mg/kg) and diallyl trisulfide (20 and 40 mg/kg) for 14 days led to a significant reduction in pain in CCI-subjected rats. Moreover, treatment with these organosulfur compounds led to the restoration of H2S, BDNF and Nrf2 levels in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia. Coadministration of ANA-12 (BDNF blocker) abolished pain attenuating actions as well as BDNF and the Nrf2 restorative actions of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, without modulating H2S levels.

This discriminatory capability is achieved by the creation of a repertoire of cells each carrying a T cell receptor (TCR) specific to non-self antigens displayed as peptides bound to the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). The understanding of the dynamics of the adaptive immune system at a repertoire level is complex, due to both the nuanced interaction of a TCR-pMHC pair and to the number of different possible TCR-pMHC pairings, making computationally exact solutions currently unfeasible. To gain some insight into this problem, we study an affinity-based model for TCR-pMHC binding in which a crystal structure is used to generate a distance-based contact map that weights the pairwise amino acid interactions. We find that the TCR-pMHC binding energy distribution strongly depends both on the number of contacts and the repeat structure allowed by the topology of the contact map of choice; this in turn influences T cell recognition probability during negative selection, with higher variances leading to higher survival probabilities. In addition, we quantify the degree to which neoantigens with mutations in sites with higher contacts are recognized at a higher rate.","output":"Contact map dependence of a T cell receptor binding repertoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expanding the US Food and Drug AdministrationCapproved indications for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer has resulted in therapeutic success and immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

Lack of standardized disease definitions and accurate phenotyping leads to syndrome misclassification and impedes development of evidence-based treatments and translational research. The objective of this study was to develop consensus guidance for an approach to irAE-Ns including disease definitions and severity grading. A working group of four neurologists drafted irAE-N consensus guidance and definitions, which were reviewed by the multidisciplinary Neuro irAE Disease Definition Panel including oncologists and irAE experts. A modified Delphi consensus process was used, with two rounds of anonymous ratings by panelists and two meetings to discuss areas of controversy. Panelists rated content for usability, appropriateness and accuracy on 9-point scales in electronic surveys and provided free text comments. Aggregated survey responses were incorporated into revised definitions. Consensus was based on numeric ratings using the RAND/University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method with prespecified definitions. 27 panelists from 15 academic medical centers voted on a total of 53 rating scales (6 general guidance, 24 central and 18 peripheral nervous system disease definition components, 3 severity criteria and 2 clinical trial adjudication statements); of these, 77% (41/53) received first round consensus.

For each disorder, six descriptors of diagnostic components are used: disease subtype, diagnostic certainty, severity, autoantibody association, exacerbation of pre-existing disease or de novo presentation, and presence or absence of concurrent irAE(s). These disease definitions standardize irAE-N classification. Diagnostic certainty is not always directly linked to certainty to treat as an irAE-N (ie, one might treat events in the probable or possible category).

Recognizing the significance of community participation in overcoming the EVD outbreak, strengthening community systems emerged as one of the most important strategies for bridging the gap in accessing primary health care (PHC) services. This study reviewed the community health policy development process in order to draw lessons from the health system strengthening efforts in Liberia post-EVD crisis. METHODS: A government-led health system analysis approach was applied to assess, review and revise the community health program in Liberia. The mixed method approach combines the use of an adapted tool to assess bottlenecks and solutions during workshops, a qualitative survey (key informant interviews and focus group discussions) to assess perceptions of challenges and perspectives from different stakeholders, and an inter-agency framework C a benchmarks matrix C to jointly review program implementation gaps using the evidence compiled, and identify priorities to scale up of the community program. RESULTS: Stakeholders identified key health system challenges and proposed policy and programmatic shifts to institutionalize a standardized community health program with fit for purpose and incentivized community health assistants to provide PHC services to the targeted populations. The community health program in Liberia is currently at the phase of implementation and requires strengthened leadership, local capacities, and resources for sustainability. Lessons learned from this review included the importance of: establishing a coordination mechanism and leveraging partnership support; using a systems approach to better inform policy shifts; strengthening community engagement; and conducting evidence-based planning to inform policy-makers. CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes toward the existing body of knowledge about policy development processes and reforms on community health in Liberia, and most likely other African settings with weak health systems. Community-based systems will play an even bigger role as we move toward building resilience for future shocks and strengthening PHC, which will require that communities be viewed as actors in the health system rather than just clients of health services.","output":"Strengthening the community health program in Liberia: Lessons learned from a health system approach to inform program design and better prepare for future shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare distance and face-to-face learning models applied in neurology clinic education during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: Medical faculty students who received clinical neurology education in the 2019-2020 academic years were included in the study. The online questionnaire used in the study consisted of three parts. The first part contained questions on students sociodemographic data and education;in the second part, questions were asked on the students competence level in meeting the cognitive and practical learning objectives of clinical neurology education;and in the third part, the medical school students attitudes toward online learning scale was included. Results: The average passing grades of the 45 students (84.3) who took the clinical neurology education face to face were lower than those of the 40 participants (91.1) who received distance education. In 30 of the 40 cognitive goals and 39 of the 40 practical goals, the group averages of the students who received face-to-face training were higher than those of the distance education group. There was no correlation between passing grades and total scores on cognitive and practical goals. There was a significant correlation between the cognitive and practical total scores of the students and attitude scale toward distance/online learning scale score in the distance education group. Conclusion: Distance education was started for clinical neurology education in the COVID-19 pandemic. The proficiency levels declared by students regarding their learning goals after distance education were lower. The results achieved with distance education, especially in practical goals, were worse. Conversely, student grades were higher in the distance education group.

Businesses and governments are implementing technologies and policies in order to improve air quality. Despite this the PM10 air quality in the mining town of Moranbah, Australia, has worsened since measurements commenced in 2011. The annual average PM10 concentrations during 2012, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all exceeded the Australian National Environmental Protection Measure's standard, and there has been an increase in the frequency of exceedances of the daily standard. The average annual increase in PM10 was 1.2  0.5 g m - 3 per year between 2011 and 2019 and has been 2.5  1.2 g m - 3 per year since 2014. The cause of this has not previously been established. Here, two machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted regression and random forest) have been implemented to model and then meteorologically normalise PM10 mass concentrations measured in Moranbah. The best performing model, using the random forest algorithm, was able to explain 59% of the variance in PM10 using a range of meteorological, environmental and temporal variables as predictors. An increasing trend after normalising for these factors was found of 0.6  0.5 g m - 3 per year since 2011 and 1.7  0.3 g m - 3 per year since 2014. These results indicate that more than half of the increase in PM10 is due to a rise in local emissions in the region. The remainder of the rise in PM10 was found to be due to a decrease of soil water content in the surrounding region, which can facilitate higher dust emissions. Whether the presence of open-cut coal mines exacerbated the role of soil water content is unclear. Although fires can have drastic effects on the local air quality, changes in fire patterns are not responsible for the rising trend. PM10 composition measurements or more detailed data relating to local sources is still needed to better isolate these emissions.

Of the restrictions enacted during COVID-19, among the more controversial surround alcohol. Like many infectious diseases, the principal mode of transmission for COVID-19 is direct respiration of droplets emitted during close social contact, and health officials warn that alcohol consumption may lead to decreased adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Governing bodies have acted to close bars before restaurants and have also specifically restricted alcohol sales, while at the same time those in the nightlife industry have labeled such actions unfounded and discriminatory. Complicating such debates is the lack of evidence on alcohol's effects on physical distance. In the current study we employed a randomized alcohol-administration design paired with computer-vision measures, analyzing over 20,000 proximity readings derived from video to examine the effect of alcohol consumption on physical distance during social interaction. Results indicated that alcohol caused individuals to draw significantly closer to an unfamiliar interaction partner during social exchange, reducing physical proximity at a rate with potentially important implications for public health. In contrast, alcohol had no effect on physical distance with a familiar interaction partner. Findings suggest that alcohol might act to overcome a natural caution people feel towards strangers and thus promote virus transmission between previously unconnected social groups.","output":"Alcohol narrows physical distance between strangers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The usage of single-use face masks (SFMs) has increased since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Herein, we report a new method to create biodegradable and reusable fibrous mask filters. The filter consists of a true nanoscale bio-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fiber (an average size of 37  4 nm) that is fabricated via electrospinning of an extremely dilute solution. Furthermore, we designed a multiscale structure with integrated features, such as low basis weight (0.91 g m(?2)), small pore size (0.73 m), and high porosity (91.72%), formed by electrospinning deposition of true nanoscale fibers on large pore of 3D scaffold nanofiber membranes. The resultant mask filter exhibited a high filtration efficiency (PM(0.3)C99.996%) and low pressure drop (104 Pa) superior to the commercial N95 filter. Importantly, this filter has a durable filtering efficiency for PM and natural biodegradability based on PLA.

Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of (1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, (2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, (3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and (4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes.

The way the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the cell is a complex process and comprises four main stages: attachment to the cognate receptor, cellular entry, replication and cellular egress. Since, this is a multi-part process, it creates many opportunities to develop effective interventions. Targeting binding of the virus to the host receptor in order to prevent its entry has been of particular interest. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, among 56 tested polyphenols, including plant extracts, brazilin, theaflavin-3,3-digallate, and curcumin displayed the highest binding with the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, inhibiting viral attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and thus cellular entry of pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 virions. Both, theaflavin-3,3-digallate at 25 g/ml and curcumin above 10 g/ml concentration, showed binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor reducing at the same time its activity in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Our study also demonstrates that brazilin and theaflavin-3,3-digallate, and to a still greater extent, curcumin, decrease the activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 both in cell-free and cell-based assays. Similar pattern was observed with cathepsin L, although only theaflavin-3,3-digallate showed a modest diminution of cathepsin L expression at protein level.

While physiological role protects the host, pathophysiological role can substantially harm the host, by triggering several hyper-inflammatory pathways, referred as hypercytokinaemia. Emerging clinical evidence suggests that exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), tricks the complement to aberrantly activate the hypercytokinaemia loop, which significantly contributes to the severity of the COVID19. The pathophysiological response of the complement is usually amplified by the over production of potent chemoattractants and inflammatory modulators, like C3a and C5a. Therefore, it is logical that neutralizing the harmful effects of the inflammatory modulators of the complement system can be beneficial for the management of COVID19. While the hunt for safe and efficacious vaccines were underway, polypharmacology based combination therapies were fairly successful in reducing both the morbidity and mortality of COVID19 across the globe. Repurposing of small molecule drugs as neutraligands of C5a appears to be an alternative for modulating the hyper-inflammatory signals, triggered by the C5a-C5aR signaling axes. Thus, in the current study, few specific and non-specific immunomodulators (azithromycin, colchicine, famotidine, fluvoxamine, dexamethasone and prednisone) generally prescribed for prophylactic usage for management of COVID19 were subjected to computational and biophysical studies to probe whether any of the above drugs can act as neutraligands, by selectively binding to C5a over C3a. The data presented in this study indicates that corticosteroids, like prednisone can have potentially better selectively (K(d)  0.38 M) toward C5a than C3a, suggesting the positive modulatory role of C5a in the general success of the corticosteroid therapy in moderate to severe COVID19.","output":"The role of human C5a as a non-genomic target in corticosteroid therapy for management of severe COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The digitization of health records resulting from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009, the adoption of meaningful use criteria, and, more recently, the Health IT Certification Program and the Cures Act have all greatly expanded the use of information technology in health care.

Several risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 disease have been identified, with obesity taking an important role. However, it is unclear whether this association is only known in the expert world or whether individuals also experience themselves as risk patients due to their obesity and whether the desire for weight reduction may also be associated with a hoped-for risk reduction. These questions were addressed in a cross-sectional study of patients who have presented to an obesity center in order to lose body weight. METHODS: Patients (n = 155) of the obesity center were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire to assess whether the desire to lose weight is also associated with a hoped-for risk reduction with respect to COVID-19 disease during the middle of the pandemic in the period between October 2020 and April 2021. We additionally assessed their perceived general stress using the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). RESULTS: In our explorative study, overall worries correlated significantly with worries about contracting COVID-19 (r = 0.483, p < 0.001). There has been an association with concerns about severe COVID-19 progression and psychological distress from the COVID-19 pandemic (r = 0.543, p < 0.001). In addition, a correlation was found between persons who worry about contracting COVID-19 and feeling like an at-risk patient (r = 0.530, p < 0.001).

In this study we aimed to identify risk factors for BRV infection and determine the G and P genotypes of BRV strains in diarrheic calves. Fecal samples were collected from 200 diarrheic calves in three districts between January 2014 and October 2015. These samples were screened to detect the presence of BRV using rapid test-strips BIO K 152 (RTSBK). The RTSBK positive samples were further tested by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the silver staining technique to detect rotavirus dsRNA. Risk factors were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The G and P genotypes of BRV were determined by RT-PCR and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method using CLC sequence viewer 8.0. About 23% of the diarrheic calves were BRV positive. The odds of BRV infection were 3.8- (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.0C14.7) and 3.9-times (95% CI:1.1C14.2) higher in Barisal and Madaripur districts, respectively, than Sirrajganj. The risk of BRV infection was 3.1-times (95% CI: 1.5C6.5) higher in calves aged  5 weeks than those aged >5 weeks. Moreover, the risk of BRV infection was 2.6-times (95% CI:1.1C5.8) higher in crossbred (Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal) than indigenous calves. G6P[11] was the predominant genotype (94.4%), followed by G10P[11] (5.6%). The BRV G6 strains were found to be closest (98.9C99.9%) to Indian strains, and BRV G10 strains showed 99.9% identities with Indian strain. The VP4 gene of all P[11] strains showed >90% identities to each other and also with Indian strains. The most frequently identified BRV genotype was G6P[11]. About 23% of calf diarrhea cases were associated with BRV. To control disease, high-risk areas and younger crossbred calves should be targeted for surveillance and management. The predominant genotype could be utilized as the future vaccine candidate or vaccines with the dominant genotype should be used to control BRV diarrhea in Bangladesh.","output":"Risk factors for bovine rotavirus infection and genotyping of bovine rotavirus in diarrheic calves in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a contagious disease originating from a novel coronavirus, COVID-19 leads to swollen air sacs in the lungs It can be diagnosed using a chest X-ray (CXR) images, which is usually cheaper and less harmful than a CT scan and is always available in small or rural hospitals X-ray machines, however, sometimes cannot diagnose COVID-19 Since the COVID-19 dataset is small and cannot be diagnosed from CXR, pre-trained neural networks can be employed for coronavirus diagnosis This paper mainly aims to use pre-trained deep transfer learning (DTL) architectures and conventional machine learning (ML) models as an automated instrument to diagnose COVID-19 from CXRs To overcome the lack of a large number of images, DTL is utilized to extract image features for better classification Then, to optimize the decision-making level for infectious diseases similar to bacterial and viral pneumonia, the extracted features are selected and classified Our proposed method was validated by creating a new CXR database from Vasei Hospital in Sabzevar, Iran Our hybrid model achieved hit rates above 99% and outperformed for CXR of COVID-19 and similar pneumonia classification Comparative analysis shows the superiority of the proposed COVID-19 classification model based on DTL over other competitive methods ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A hybrid deep transfer learning based approach for COVID-19 classification in chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing safe infrastructure for cycling and micromobility is an efficient pathway towards climate-friendly, sustainable, and livable cities.

We introduce a parameter that tunes the focus between demand-based and safety-based development, and investigate systematically this tradeoff for the city of Turin. We find that a full focus on demand or safety generates different network extensions in the short term, with an optimal tradeoff in-between.

We used five well-established psychological levers to improve on the efficacy of two posters used by the French authorities (one on protective behaviors and one on proper handwashing). The five levers were: simplification (streamlining the posters), sunk costs (emphasizing the costs already paid to fight the pandemic), morality (emphasizing the duty to help others), self-protection (emphasizing the personal risks), and disgust (pointing out and illustrating that not following the protective behaviors or proper handwashing had consequences that should trigger disgust). We tested on a large (N = 3000) nationally representative French sample whether versions of the posters using these levers, compared to a control condition, were clearer, better recalled, and increased peoples intention to follow the posters recommendations. On the whole, there were no effects of the manipulations on any of the measures. The only consistent pattern was that the control protective behavior poster was better recalled than the alternatives (except for the simplified version), possibly because it contained one fewer message. The lack of effect on behavioral intentions might be attributed to the potential saturation in terms of health communication at the time of the experiment. Our results--mostly null and potentially negative--confirm the importance of testing interventions before using them in a public health campaign, even if they are grounded in successful past interventions.","output":"Improving preventive health behaviors in the COVID-19 crisis: a messaging intervention in a large nationally representative sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii are becoming alarming worldwide.

EXPERT OPINION Moderate progresses have been made in the research and development of A. baumannii vaccine in the last five years, in particular in the areas of identification of new protein targets, development of multicomponent vaccines and use of vaccines and antibodies as adjuncts for antibiotics therapies. However, substantial scientific and logistic challenges, such as selection of lead vaccine candidates and formulation, vaccine clinical trials and targeted population, and financial incentives, remain. Thus, innovative strategies will be needed before an A. baumannii vaccine candidate can be brought into late stage of preclinical development in next five years.","output":"Where are we and how far is there to go in the development of an Acinetobacter vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To identify and quantify associations between baseline characteristics on hospital admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary hospital in Spain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective case series included 238 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Hospital Universitario Clnico San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) who were discharged or who died. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on sex, age, personal antecedents, clinical features, findings on physical examination, and laboratory results for each patient. Associations between mortality and baseline characteristics were estimated as hazard ratios (HR) calculated with Cox regression models. Series mortality was 25.6%. Among patients with dependence for basic activities of daily living, 78.7% died, and among patients residing in retirement homes, 80.8% died. The variables most clearly associated with a greater hazard of death were age (3% HR increase per 1-year increase in age; 95%CI 1C6), diabetes mellitus (HR 2.42, 95%CI 1.43C4.09), SatO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (43% HR reduction per 1-point increase; 95%CI 23C57), SOFA score (19% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 5C34) and CURB-65 score (76% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23C143). CONCLUSIONS: The patients residing in retirement homes showed great vulnerability.

The insula is considered to be a core part of the pain network in the brain. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the posterior insula (PI) and sensory processing, and between the anterior insula (AI) and cognitive-affective factors. Objectives: Our aim was to distinguish sensory and cognitive responses in pain-related insular activities. Methods: We recorded spatiotemporal insular activation patterns of healthy participants (n = 20) during pain or tactile processing with painful or nonpainful movie stimuli, using a magnetoencephalography. We compared the peak latency between PI and AI activities in each stimulus condition, and between pain and tactile processing in each response. The peak latency and amplitude between different movies were then examined to explore the effects of cognitive influence. A visual analogue scale was used to assess subjective perception. Results: The results revealed one clear PI activity and 2 AI activities (early and late) in insular responses induced by pain/tactile stimulation. The early response transmitted from the PI to AI was observed during sensory-associated brain activity, whereas the late AI response was observed during cognitive-associated activity. In addition, we found that painful movie stimuli had a significant influence on both late AI activity and subjective perception, caused by nonpainful actual stimulation. Conclusions: The current findings suggested that late AI activation reflects the processing of cognitive pain information, whereas the PI and early AI responses reflect sensory processing.","output":"Late responses in the anterior insula reflect the cognitive component of pain: evidence of nonpain processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fear of an infection is posing a major threat in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis Although nothing novel but still when we see historically over the times, fear of infection in any pandemic crisis remains the same even after the advent of modern medical advancements This morbid fear of risk of infection has more traumatic effect psychologically than reality of succumbing to an infection and its recovery Nevertheless, the cause of the fear and its management is very important in this COVID-19 crisis situation Homoeopathy system of medicine offers a safe, palatable, economical and an eco-friendly management solution to tackle this morbid fear Homoeopathy is being used by the public since a very long time and people continue to experience its overall health benefits with utmost trust and diligence Two cases of morbid fear of COVID-19 infection treated homoeopathically with positive outcome are presented here","output":"Psychometric Assessment of Morbid Fear of COVID-19 and Its Homoeopathic ManagementA Treatment Perspective through Case Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients.

The current systematic review synthesized evidence on the characteristics, effectiveness and acceptability of behavioral activation (BA) to examine its role as a potential active ingredient for alleviating depression and anxiety among young people aged 14 to 24 years. METHODS: Evidence across the following sources were synthesized: (i) randomized control trials (RCT) evaluating interventions where BA has been used as a standalone intervention or as part of a multicomponent intervention, (ii) qualitative studies examining the acceptability of BA as an intervention or as a coping strategy among young people with lived experiences. Consultations with a youth advisory group (YAG) from India were used to draw inferences from existing evidence and identify future research priorities. RESULTS: As part of the review, 23 RCTs were identified; three studies examined BA as a standalone intervention, and the remaining studies examined multicomponent intervention where BA was a constituent element. The intervention protocols varied in composition, with the number of intervention elements ranging between 5 to 18. There was promising but limited evidence in standalone interventions for thse effectiveness of BA for depression. The impact of BA in multicomponent interventions was difficult to evaluate in the absence of focal assessment of activation outcomes. Evidence from 37 additional qualitative studies of youth lived experience literature, corroborated by the YAG inputs, indicated that young people preferred using behavioral strategies similar to BA to cope with depression in their own life. Themes indicated that the activities that are important to an individual and their socio-contextual factors need to be considered in the planning and implementing BA intervention. Evidence for the use of BA in anxiety was limited across data sources. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was preliminary empirical evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of BA for youth depression. Further research is needed to examine the components and mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness as an active intervention ingredient for depression and anxiety.

It is clear within the profession that pharmacists use their scope of knowledge and technical skills to address medication-related needs of individuals and populations. However, confusion still remains in the professional and public literature about what a pharmacist precisely produces for society. Is it a drug, service, program, solution, or something else? As the profession evolves from one that focuses on dispensing drugs to a profession that seeks to achieve positive patient health outcomes, pharmacists need to better conceptualize and articulate what they produce. This narrative review explores ideas from the marketing, business strategy, and entrepreneurship literature to discuss diverse perspectives on the pharmacists product. The four perspectives are the product as (1) a tangible product, (2) an intangible service, (3) a smart, connected good or service, and (4) a solution to a customer problem in whatever form provided. Based upon these perspectives, the pharmacists product can be any combination of tangible or intangible, face-to-face or virtual offering produced by pharmacists that seeks to satisfy medication-related needs and wants of pharmacy patients and customers. Ideas discussed in this review include the total product concept, classification schemes from the services marketing literature, the theory of service-dominant logic, the concepts of smart, connected products and industrialized intimacy, and the jobs-to-be-done framework.

Hyper-homocysteinemia is related to many virus infection outcomes, including HEV, HPV and HIV. Recent data confirmed the value of Hcy in predicting the risk of severe pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective cohort study, including 313 CoViD-19 hospitalized patients (female 34.8%;mean age 62 years), also included a broad panel of clinical laboratory data collected. Of the enrolled patients, 10.9% died during hospitalization (3% were transferred to other hospitals and were lost to follow-up). Results: Hcy was found to be the strongest predictor of CoViD- 19 critical-progression leading to death. Univariate analysis demonstrated that age (OR 1.04), Hcy (OR 1.06), and neutrophil/lymphocyte count ratio (OR 1.03) were significant predictors of critical progression leading to death and RBC (OR 0.68) and lymphocytes count (OR 0.23) with benign outcome.

Between 2019 and 2020, telehealth (TH) visits, including tele-rehabilitation (TR), increased from 11% to 46%. While many therapy interventions can be performed with verbal guidance or demonstration, objective tool-based outcomes such as goniometrics , a valuable tool to determine burn survivor progress, have proved more challenging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of confidence of therapists using three different remote methods of measuring finger range of motion (ROM). Methods Therapists evaluated finger ROM position of a mannequin model via a simulated TH visit using three different methods: Goniometry (GON), Visual Estimation (VE), and Electronic Protractor (EP). Pre and post-questionnaires were used to assess the participants experiences and comfort with each method of measurement. Descriptive statistics are used to report clinician opinions. A linear mixed effect model was used to determine the interaction of bias as a function of clinician characteristics (i.e., experience, familiarity, etc.). Results A total of 30 therapists and one hand surgeon participated. All reported some (30%) or a lot (70%) of familiarity with standard GON, and most reported some (30%)or a lot (40%) of familiarity with finger-specific goniometry. Post-testing, clinicians reported VE (80%) as the most difficult method and EP (73%) as the easiest. Only 7% reported feeling more confident with TR compared to in-person measurements, 27% felt equally confident, and 67% felt less confident. The average time to conduct the remote assessment measurement was 11:45 minutes using GON, 4:27 minutes using VE and 9:47 minutes using EP. There was not a significant relationship between performance bias and years of experience (p=0.587), familiarity with GON (p=0.406), familiarity with finger GON (p=0.709) or profession (p=0.281). Conclusions Despite the transition to virtual care, the mandate for valid and accurate documentation of functional outcome measures, including ROM, remains.

However this was only recommended for an ELISA-based assay. It advised that local TTG assay reliability needs correlating to pathology as part of any local audit.Since June 2019, our health board switched from an ELISA based assay to a chemiluminescence based assay for TTG measurement. This study aims to compare the two distinct assays, and propose an appropriate cut-off level for the chemiluminescence assay.MethodIn this retrospective, observational study across two sites, all elevated TTG results in adult patients from January 2018 to December 2019 were identified from biochemistry records. Patients already known to have coeliac disease were excluded from analysis. In patients with multiple elevated TTG results only the earliest result was included. Data was collected on patient demographics, waiting times, and duodenal biopsy results. Prior to June 2019 an ELISA based assay was used with TTG results <10 U/ml considered negative. Since June 2019 a chemiluminescence assay (Bioflash) was employed, with TTG results <20 U/ml reported as negative.ResultsIn total, 192 elevated TTG results were included in the analysis. One hundred and nine patients had duodenal biopsies performed, 73 patients were not referred or declined investigation, and 10 patients were still waiting for duodenal biopsy at the time of analysis in May 2021. The median waiting time for these 10 patients still awaiting biopsy was 456 days.Using the ELISA based assay, 96% patients (n=27) with TTG > 10 x ULN had positive duodenal biopsies, whereas positive biopsies were only present in 56% patients (n=9) with TTG between 5 C 10 x ULN.Using the Chemiluminescence assay, 90% patients (n=21) with TTG > 10 x ULN had positive duodenal biopsies, however positive biopsies were also present in 89% patients (n=9) with TTG between 5 C 10 x ULN.DiscussionThese results support the BSG guidance for non-biopsy diagnosis of coeliac disease using a pathway that includes TTG > 10 x ULN measured by an ELISA assay. However for the chemiluminescence assay (Bioflash) it appears that a TTG level  5 x ULN may be a more appropriate cut-off level to use in the pathway. Further work is required to confirm this as the numbers in this study are small. This study also shows the long time periods that patients in some centres are waiting for their duodenal biopsies, likely exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, and thus the importance of establishing a non-biopsy protocol where appropriate.","output":"Cut-off values of IgA-tTG in non-biopsy diagnostic pathways for coeliac disease need to be assay-specific"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 is a transmissible disease and has caused havoc throughout the world.

The trajectory analysis (DCCM & PCA), structural integrity, and degree of compaction depicted the protein-ligand complex stability (PDB-PISA and Rgyr). Results obtained from screening shortlists 13 compounds possessing high Docking score. Further, seven compounds had a permissible RMSD limit (3 ?), with robust RMSF. Post-MD analysis of the top two compounds (204 and 502), DCCM & PCA analysis show a positive atomic displacements correlation among residues of active sites-dimer (Chain A and Chain B) & residual clustering. The Gint of RNA-bound (-83.5 kcal/mol) and drug-bound N-CTD-204 (-40.8 kcal/mol) and 502(-39.7 kcal/mol) as compared to Apo (-35.95 kcal/mol) suggests stabilization of protein, with less RNA-binding possibility. The Rgyr values depict the loss of compactness on RNA-binding when compared to the drug-bound N-CTD complex. Further, overlapping the protein complexes (0 ns and 100 ns) display significant changes in RMSD of the protein (204-2.07 ? and 502-1.89 ?) as compared to the Apo (1.72 ?) and RNA-bound form (1.76 ?), suggesting strong interaction for compound 204 as compared to 502.

METHODS: We prospectively collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of children <5 years with radiologically confirmed CAAP referred to the Soroka University Medical Center during 2001-2011. Three groups of children were compared: 1) those hospitalized in the PICU (PICU-CAAP); 2) those treated in the emergency department and discharged (ED-CAAP); and 3) those hospitalized in a pediatric ward (Hosp-CAAP). RESULTS: Of 9722 CAAP episodes, 367 (3.8%) were PICU-CAAP, 5552 (57.1%) Hosp-CAAP and 3803 (39.1%) ED-CAAP. In a univariate analysis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected more commonly among PICU-CAAP than in Hosp-CAAP (P = 0.02) and ED-CAAP patients (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, several factors were associated with PICU hospitalization versus ED-CAAP and Hosp-CAAP: Younger age (ORs: 1.04, [95%CI: 1.02-1.05] and 0.97 [0.96-0.98], respectively); prematurity (ORs: 2.16 [1.28-3.64] and 1.61 [1.15-2.26], respectively), lower O2 saturation (ORs: 1.32 [1.25-1.41] and 0.94[0.92-0.96]), higher respiratory rate (ORs: 1.06 [1.04-1.07] and 1.00 [1-1.01], respectively).

To achieve that, we installed ultraviolet germicidal lights (UVGI) in an existing dehumidifier with a total cost of USD $150.7 (NZD $213.76). The UVGI lights are known to be efficient in destroying the DNA of fungi and bacteria. The results show that the device reduced the fungi growth and did increase the room temperature because the dehumidifier captured two litres of water over 24 h of testing. The proposed device did achieve a reduction in particulate matters, from 0.9 [Formula: see text] to 0.14 [Formula: see text] and an acceptable range of relative humidity below 50%, which reduces the favourable conditions for fungi growth.

The analysis arrived at substantially different results when adolescents were grouped by sex or preference towards STEM. It also demonstrated that gender stereotypes are connected with cognitive abilities, with a stronger link in the no-STEM group.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study using patient visit data from electronic health records from hematology-oncology and radiation-oncology service lines spanning the local onset of the pandemic from March 18, 2020, through March 31, 2021. This period was subdivided into four phases designated as lockdown, transition, stabilization, and second wave. Generalized linear mixed regression models were used to estimate the effects of patient characteristics on trends for rates of telemedicine use across phases and the effects of visit type on patient satisfaction and postvisit ER or hospital admissions within 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 19,280 patients with 102,349 visits (13.1% audio-only and 1.4% video) were studied. Patient age (increased use in age < 45 and 85 years and older) and urban residence were associated with higher use of telemedicine, especially after initial lockdown. Recent cancer therapy, ER use, and hospital admissions in the past year were all associated with lower telemedicine utilization across pandemic phases. Provider clinical department corresponded to the largest differences in telemedicine use across all phases. ER and hospital admission rates in the 2 weeks after a telehealth visit were lower than those in in-person visits (0.7% v 1.3% and 1.2% v 2.7% for ER and hospital use, respectively; P < .001).

Ahead of the vaccine roll-out in children, we aimed to determine whether parents intended to vaccinate their children and describe reasons for their intentions. Methods We recruited parents on social media and collected information on parental socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccine history, intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, and reasons for parental decisions, using an anonymous online survey. We identified associations between parental characteristics and intention to vaccinate children using a logistic regression model and described reasons for intentions to vaccinate or not using proportions together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results 1837 parents participated. Parental non-vaccination and having experienced major vaccination side effects were strongly associated with non-intention to vaccinate their children (OR 0.09 and 0.18 respectively, p<0.001). Compared with others, parents who were younger, lived in the socioeconomically deprived periphery, and belonged to the Arab population had lower intentions to vaccinate their children. Commonly stated reasons for non-intention to vaccinate included vaccine safety and efficacy (53%, 95%CI 50-56) and the belief that COVID-19 was a mild disease (73%, 95%CI 73-79). The most frequently mentioned motives for intending to vaccine children was returning to normal social and educational life (89%, 95%CI 87-91). Conclusion Parental socio-demographic background and their own vaccination experience was associated with intention to vaccinate their children aged 5 to 11. Intention to vaccinate was mainly for social and economic reasons rather than health, whereas non-intention to vaccinate mainly stemmed from health concerns. Understanding rationales for COVID-19 vaccine rejection or acceptance, as well as parental demographic data, can pave the way for intentional educational campaigns to encourage not only vaccination against COVID-19, but also regular childhood vaccine programming.","output":"Reasons underlying the intention to vaccinate children aged 5-11 against COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of parents in Israel, November 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at higher risk for Covid19. Sero-surveillance among HCWs using IgG antibodies can add further value to the scientific findings.

Methods: Population based large scale sero-surveillance among HCWs was carried out during second half of August'20 in Ahmedabad using \\"Covid-Kavach\\" IgG Antibody Detection ELISA kits. Seropositivity among HCWs was estimated and compared with various demographic & other factors to understand their infection & immunity status. Proportions and Z-test were used as appropriate. Results: As on August'20, Seropositivity among HCWs from Ahmedabad is 23.65% (95% Confidence Interval 21.70-25.73%). Seropositivity of 25.98% (95%CI 23.47-28.66) among female HCWs is significantly higher than 19.48% (95%CI 16.53-22.80) among male HCWs. The zone wise positivity among HCWs closely correlate with cases reported from the respective zone. The sero-positivity among HCWs from the earliest and worst affected zones have lower level of seropositivity as compared to the zones affected recently. This might be pointing towards the fact that the IgG Antibodies may not be long lasting.

Such measures can reduce the exposure to bioaerosols, which can result in pathogen deposition in the respiratory tract of the host causing disease and an immunological response.

Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing phase 3 randomised clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, we encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines and immunisation rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation from other vaccine trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus) showed a favourable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, healthcare authorities should prioritise vaccinations for cancer patients, with the time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis.

RESULTS: Rates of full compliance with the recommended behaviours ranged from 31% (keeping at least 2 m away from other people when inside shops) to 68% (not visiting or meeting friends or other family members). Capacity was a significant predictor of compliance with each of the five recommended behaviours. Increasing age and intentions were also predictive of compliance with three of the behaviours.

The strain that the outbreak imposes on health systems will undoubtedly impact the sexual and reproductive health of individuals living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, sexual and reproductive health will also be affected by societal responses to the pandemic, such as local or national lockdowns that force health services to shut down if they are not deemed essential, as well as the consequences of physical distancing, travel restrictions and economic slowdowns.","output":"Estimates of the Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sexual and Reproductive Health In Low- and Middle-Income Countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The enforcement of complete lockdown with home confinement has been necessary to limit SARS-CoV-2 contagions in Italy, one the most affected countries worldwide. Simultaneously, in several Emergency Departments, a reduction in cardio- and cerebrovascular presentations was noticed. This study analyses the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the incidence of stroke, in Campania, the most densely-populated region in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data regarding acute stroke patients presenting at 5 Campania stroke hubs, before and after the issue of lockdown in Italy on March 9th, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown, we observed a significant reduction in the number of acute reperfusion treatments in stroke (P for interact 0.001); however the global number of patients presenting with acute stroke did not significantly differ. The time to reach medical attention was significantly longer in the lockdown phase (230 versus 154 min, P 0.016). For patients who underwent acute reperfusion treatment we also observed significantly longer time-to-imaging (30 versus 40 min, P 0.0005) and a trend to longer time-to-needle (75 versus 90 min P 0.23), but not time-to-groin. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the reduction in acute reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke and the slowdown of stroke pathways, during the lockdown phase of Covid-19 pandemic, in Campania, the third-most-populous and the most-densely populated Italian Region. In the next future, the risk for high-grade disability and death, due to delayed or even avoided hospital presentation due to fear of contagion, may be high.","output":"The Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Stroke Admissions and Treatments in Campania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endosymbiosis is found in all types of ecosystems and it can be sensitive to environmental changes due to the intimate interaction between the endosymbiont and the host. Indeed, global climate change disturbs the local ambient environment and threatens endosymbiotic species, and in some cases leads to local ecosystem collapse. Recent studies have revealed that the endosymbiont can affect holobiont (endosymbiont and host together) stress tolerance as much as the host does, and manipulation of the microbial partners in holobionts may mitigate the impacts of the environmental stress. Here, we first show how the endosymbiont presence affects holobiont stress tolerance by discussing three well-studied endosymbiotic systems, which include plant-fungi, aquatic organism-algae, and insect-bacteria systems. We then review how holobionts are able to alter their stress tolerance via associated endosymbionts by changing their endosymbiont composition, by adaptation of their endosymbionts, or by acclimation of their endosymbionts. Finally, we discuss how different transmission modes (vertical or horizontal transmission) might affect the adaptability of holobionts. We propose that the endosymbiont is a good target for modifying holobiont stress tolerance, which makes it critical to more fully investigate the role of endosymbionts in the adaptive responses of holobionts to stress.","output":"Endosymbiont-Mediated Adaptive Responses to Stress in Holobionts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo/Objetivos A pandemia da COVID-19 trouxe desafios para enfrentamento do vrus e de outros agravos.

This virus, which was first identified in December 2019 in China, has resulted in a yet ongoing viral pandemic. Coronaviridae could potentially cause several disorders in a wide range of hosts such as birds and mammals. Although infections caused by this family of viruses are predominantly limited to the respiratory tract, Betacoronaviruses are potentially able to invade the central nervous system (CNS) as well as many other organs, thereby inducing neurological damage ranging from mild to lethal in both animals and humans. Over the past two decades, three novel CoVs, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, emerging from animal reservoirs have exhibited neurotropic properties causing severe and even fatal neurological diseases. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses has yet to be fully known. Both clinical features of the previous CoV epidemics (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) and lessons from animal models used in studying neurotropic CoVs, especially SARS and MERS, constitute beneficial tools in comprehending the exact mechanisms of virus implantation and in illustrating pathogenesis and virus dissemination pathways in the CNS. Here, we review the animal research which assessed CNS infections with previous more studied neurotropic CoVs to demonstrate how experimental studies with appliable animal models can provide scientists with a roadmap in the CNS impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, animal studies can finally help us discover the underlying mechanisms of damage to the nervous system in COVID-19 patients and find novel therapeutic agents in order to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infections, before and after COVID-19: a review of animal studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), the major energy currency of the cell, is involved in many cellular processes, including the viral life cycle, and can be used as an indicator of early signs of cytopathic effect (CPE).

Although children, including children with cancer, have been found to be affected less commonly and less severely than adults, indirect effects of the pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of children with cancer have been less described. METHODS: A survey was performed in the four largest tertiary pediatric hematology-oncology medical centers in Israel. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the medical files of patients diagnosed or treated with cancer during AprilCOctober 2020. RESULTS: Seventeen patients are described, who had a significant delay in diagnosis or treatment of cancer. These represent approximately 10% of all pediatric cancer diagnosed during the study period in these centers. A main cause of delay was fear of exposure to COVID-19 (fears felt by the patient, parent, physician, or decision-makers at the institution; or the implementation of national guidelines). Delays also resulted from co-infection with COVID-19 and the attribution of the oncologic symptoms to the infection. In addition, treatment was delayed of patients already diagnosed with cancer, due to COVID-19 infection detected in the patient, a family member, or a bone marrow donor. CONCLUSION: Fear from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of children with cancer, which may carry a risk to dismal prognosis.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 510(10) viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], ?49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, ?76.8 to 54.8).

Short proximal femur nails (PFN) used for fixing these fractures, unlike the long nails, are non-anatomic and are usually straight with no curvature in antero-posterior plane. As a result, there is always a chance of the nail tip impinging against the anterior cortex of femur. Materials and methods A total of 80 patients with trochanteric fractures (AO 31A2 and 31A3), operated with short PFN, were followed up retrospectively and prospectively from 2019 to 2021, for a period of 6 months. All fractures were fixed with PFNs, with nails ranging from 170 to 250 mm. Radiological analysis was done on hip lateral X-rays (taken at 6 months) using Angle at Distant Axis (ADA) and Nail Tip Position (NTP). Functional outcome analysis was done using Harris Hip Score. Patients were graded into 2 groups according to ADA (ADA>4 and ADA<4). Incidence of anterior thigh pain was noted in patients on follow up and was statistically evaluated with nail size, nail diameter, ADA and NTP. Results Mean ADA was 4.19  1.45; mean NTP grade was 1.98  1.11. Mean nail size was 201.87 mm with a mean nail diameter of 9.76 mm. Twenty patients complained of anterior thigh pain on follow-up. Twenty-five patients had NTP grade 3 or above of which 16 complained of anterior thigh pain (p < 0.001). Fifty-five patients had nail diameter of 10 mm or above of which 14 had anterior thigh pain (p < 0.01). Fifty-three patients had a nail length of 200 mm or above of which 16 patients complained of thigh pain on follow up (p < 0.01).

We duly operationalized job crafting, work engagement, and workaholism by using the Job Crafting Scale, the UWES-9, and the Work Addiction Risk Test. The current study focused on the Finnish public sector, since work engagement is recognized at the governmental level and has been shown to be strongly and positively associated with economic activity and productivity, while workaholism is associated with poor wellbeing. We analyzed the data by using structural equation modeling and found that three job crafting dimensions were strongly intertwined with one another. These dimensions were increasing structural job resources, increasing social job resources, and increasing challenging job demands. In the structural model, dimension increasing structural job resources was positively related to work engagement, whereas dimension decreasing hindering job demands was negatively associated with workaholism. This study highlighted the relevance of employees learning to balance their job resources and demands. We recommend that, in the public sector, employees be systematically encouraged to practice job crafting behavior by enabling them to increase structural job resources.

Our aim was to report the incidence of hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19 at Brazilian hospitals. METHODS: We investigated the incidence of HA COVID-19 in Brazilian hospitals using data from a national surveillance system, from August 2020 through September 2021. Definitions of HA COVID-19 were: I-symptom onset >14 after hospital admission plus a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen test; II-symptom onset on days 8-14 after admission, plus a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen test positive, plus documented high-risk exposure. We performed descriptive analyses and reported HA COVID-19 rates using pooled mean and percentile distribution. RESULTS: 48,634 cases of HA COVID-19 were reported from 1,428 hospitals. Incidence ranged from 0.16/1000 patients-days at neonatal ICUs until 5.8/1000 patients-days at adults ICUs. The highest incidence of HA COVID-19 was during the months March to July 2021, similar of what was observed for community-acquired COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a national view of the burden of HA COVID-19. The highest incidence of HA COVID-19 similar of what was observed of community-acquired. We believe that this reflects the difficulty of implementing preventive measures. Further studies evaluating risk factors for the hospital transmission of SARS-Cov-2 should clarify strategies to minimize the risk of HA COVID-19 and may be applicable to other respiratory diseases.

Using a combined two-steps approach of virtual screening and molecular docking techniques, we have screened an in-house collection of small molecules, mainly composed of natural and nature-inspired compounds. The molecules were selected with high structural diversity to cover a wide range of chemical space into the enzyme pockets. Virtual screening experiments were performed using the blind docking mode of the AutoDock Vina software. Virtual screening allowed the selection of structurally heterogeneous compounds capable of interacting effectively with the enzymatic site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

Additionally, a principal components analysis uncovered four reliable principal motivations underlying engagement in casual sex, and three principal emotional outcomes of casual sex. Predictors of negative emotional outcomes included being motivated to regulate negative emotions and to achieve positive emotions.

Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus. Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works. Methods To investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets. Findings The transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region. Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus. Interpretation An onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet. The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence.

Oman has implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. However, responses to NPIs may be different across different populations within a country with a large number of migrants, such as Oman. This study investigated the different responses to NPIs, and assessed the use of the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) to monitor them. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 data for Oman, from February 24 to June 3, 2020, were used alongside demographic and epidemiological information. Data were arranged into pairs of infector-infectee, and two main libraries of R software were used to estimate reproductive number (Rt). Rt was calculated for both Omanis and non-Omanis. FINDINGS: A total of 13,538 cases were included, 44.9% of which were Omanis. Among all these cases we identified 2769 infector-infectee pairs for calculating Rt. There was a sharp drop in Rt from 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-4.6) in mid-March to 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) in late March in response to NPIs. Rt then decreased further to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) in late April after which it rose, corresponding to the easing of NPIs. Comparing the two groups, the response to major public health controls was more evident in Omanis in reducing Rt to 1.09 (95% CI 0.84-1.3) by the end of March. INTERPRETATION: Use of real-time estimation of Rt allowed us to follow the effects of NPIs.

Placental oxygen, nutrients, and waste are transported through processes that depend on vascular structure and cell type-specific expression and localization of membrane transporters. Understanding how the placenta develops holds great significance for maternalCfetal medicine. The purpose of this review is to examine current information regarding placental progenitor populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide unprecedented depth for the investigation of cell type-specific gene expression patterns in the placenta. Thus far, several mouse placenta scRNA-seq studies have been conducted which produced and analyzed transcriptomes of placental progenitors and cells of the fully developed placenta between embryonic day (E) 7.0 and E12.5. Together with human placenta scRNA-seq data which, in part, has been produced through coordinated research campaigns in the scientific community to understand the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these mammalian studies lend fundamental insight into the cellular and molecular composition of hemochorial placentae found in both mouse and human. SUMMARY: Single-cell placenta research has advanced understanding of tissue-resident stem cells and molecules that are poised to support maternalCfetal communication and nutrient transport. Herein, we provide context for these recent findings by reviewing placental anatomy and cell populations, and discuss recent scRNA-seq mouse placenta findings.

RESULTS Twenty-four percent of mothers and 16% of fathers had Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scores 23, which have been correlated with a major depression diagnosis. There were no differences in depressive symptoms between mothers and fathers.

We employed the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method to analyze over 1.3 million cases of emergency attendance in May 2006 through April 2009 and the 7-day weather forecast data for the same period. Our results showed that the ARIMA model could offer reasonably accurate forecasts of daily ambulance calls at 1C7 days ahead of time and with improved accuracy by including weather factors. Specifically, the inclusion of average temperature alone in our ARIMA model improved the predictability of the 1-day forecast when compared to that of a simple ARIMA model (8.8 % decrease in the root mean square error, RMSE = 53 vs 58). The improvement in the 7-day forecast with average temperature as a predictor was more pronounced, with a 10 % drop in prediction error (RMSE = 62 vs 69). These findings suggested that weather forecast data can improve the 1- to 7-day forecasts of daily ambulance demand.

In this context, it is important to assess whether the clinical management of non-Covid patients has not been compromised. Among non-Covid cases, patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and stroke need non-deferrable emergency care and are the natural candidates to be studied. Preliminary evidence suggests that the time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation has significantly increased in Covid-19 times as well as the 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We check, in a causal inference framework, the causal effect of the hospitals stress generated by Covid-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality rates (primary end-point of the study) of AMI and stroke over several time-windows of 15-days around the implementation date of the State of Emergency restrictions for COVID-19 (March, 9(th) 2020) using two quasi-experimental approaches, regression-discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-regression-discontinuity (DRD) designs. Data are drawn from Spedali Civili of Brescia, one of the most hit provinces in Italy by Covid-19 during March and May 2020. FINDINGS: Despite the potential adverse effects on expected mortality due to a longer time to hospitalization and staff extra-burden generated by the first wave of Covid-19, the AMI and stroke mortality rates are overall not statistically different during the first wave of Covid-19 than before the first peak. The obtained results provided by RDD models are robust also when we account for seasonality and unobserved factors with DRD models.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 from four Atlanta hospitals were included in this observational cohort study and underwent admission testing of MOCHA parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin monomer). Clinical outcomes included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, access line thrombosis, ICU admission, intubation and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: Of 276 patients (mean age 59  6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American), 45 (16%) had a thrombotic endpoint. Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p<0.05) and &#8805; 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8) as were admission D-dimer &#8805; 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and &#8805; 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9).

Administering tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, is one strategy to reduce bleeding; however, it must be given soon after injury to be effective and minimize adverse effects. Administering TXA topically to a wound site would decrease the time to treatment and could enable both local and systemic delivery if a suitable formulation existed to deliver the drug deep into wounds adequately. OBJECTIVES To determine whether self-propelling particles could increase the efficacy of TXA. METHODS Using previously developed self-propelling particles, which consist of calcium carbonate and generate CO2 gas, TXA was formulated to disperse in blood and wounds. The antifibrinolytic properties were assessed in vitro and in a murine tail bleeding assay. Self-propelled TXA was also tested in a swine model of junctional hemorrhage consisting of femoral arteriotomy without compression. RESULTS Self-propelled TXA was more effective than non-propelled formulations in stabilizing clots from lysis in vitro and reducing blood loss in mice. It was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously in mice up to 300 to 1000 mg/kg. When it was incorporated in gauze, four of six pigs treated after a femoral arteriotomy and without compression survived, and systemic concentrations of TXA reached approximately 6 mg/L within the first hour. CONCLUSIONS A formulation of TXA that disperses the drug in blood and wounds was effective in several models. It may have several advantages, including supporting local clot stabilization, reducing blood loss from wounds, and providing systemic delivery of TXA.

In Europe, in the past decade, few autochthonous outbreaks were described. AIM: We aimed to identify factors associated with frequency of dengue virus infection among European travellers and at assessing how surveillance data could support preparedness against autochthonous outbreaks within Europe. METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of travel-related dengue cases reported by European countries from 2015 through 2019. Using flight passenger data, we calculated travellers infection rates (TIR). We investigated the following associations: (i) between TIR and incidence rate in selected countries of infection and (ii) between number of travel-related cases and occurrence of autochthonous outbreaks within Europe. RESULTS: There were 11,478 travel-related dengue cases and the TIR was 2.8 cases per 100,000 travellers. Most cases were infected in Asia (71%), predominantly in south-eastern Asia. The TIR was highest among travellers returning from Asia (6.1/100,000). There was an association between the incidence rate in the country of infection and the TIR but no association between the number of travel-related cases and occurrence of autochthonous outbreaks in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of infection in travellers is a function of the ongoing epidemiological situation in the country of exposure.

All patients were followed up regularly (every 15 days) until November 30, 2020, and the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 was observed. RESULTS: Totally, 18 PLWH and 185 HIV-na?ve individuals with COVID-19 were enrolled. The positive conversion rates of IgG were 56% in PLWH and 88% in HIV-na?ve patients respectively, and the peak was on the 45th day after COVID-19 onset. However, the positive rate of IgG dropped to 12% in PLWH and 33% among HIV-na?ve individuals by the end of the study. The positive conversion rate of IgG among asymptomatic carriers is significantly lower than that among patients with moderate disease (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.07C0.85). PLWH had a lower IgG seroconversion rate (AOR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.03C0.39) and shorter IgG duration (AHR = 3.99, 95% CI 1.43C11.13) compared to HIV-na?ve individuals.

AIM: Summarize the most relevant data from a literature systematic review on the impact on youths' physical health of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors of the original review searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Forty-two studies reporting the impact on physical health have been finally included. They have been conducted in 14 countries, most of which in Italy (30.9%) and UK (30.9%). The majority were cohort studies (40.5%) and the overall methodological quality, irrespective of study designs, was high for the 71.4% of the studies. Twenty-seven studies assessed the impact on health services utilization, whose results showed a relevant reduction of Emergency Departments accesses (64%-89.3%) and hospital admissions (31%-85%); however, an increase of acute cases was observed together with delayed admission. An important reduction of vaccine services utilization was also noted during the first period of lockdown. Domestic accidents and head trauma for suspected domestic violence increased. Health related behaviours worsened, with a relevant increase of screen time (mean of 2.9 hours to 5.1 hours), an important reduction of physical activity (up to 64%). Finally, sleep problems and increase of food consumption, particularly the unhealthy food were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant negative effects of school closure and social distances measures have observed. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of closures implemented for relatively short periods. If school closure and rigid social distances measures imposition will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. In the context of health policies, in addition to the potential benefits of school closures and social distancing measures on the containment of infection, the potential damage on the physical health of young people should be taken into account by implementing policies to safeguard their health.","output":"[Impact of social distancing for covid-19 on youths' physical health: a systematic review of the literature.]/ Impatto del distanziamento sociale per covid-19 sulla salute fisica dei giovani: una revisione sistematica della letteratura"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study described the views of older New Zealand adults toward assisted dying and specifically the End of Life Choice Act (2019), an Act making assisted dying legal.

Although NIRS holds potential for bedside monitoring of intestinal perfusion, there is insufficient evidence showing correlation with mesenteric blood flow. To determine if an association exists between abdominal regional oxygen saturation (A-rSO2) and mesenteric blood flow, we compared changes in A-rSO2 to changes in blood flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) before and after feedings in very-low birthweight infants. STUDY DESIGN A-rSO2 was continuously monitored midline below the umbilicus for 3 days in 18 stable 25 to 31 week bolus-fed infants (median BW 1203 g, median age 5 days). We compared change in SMA velocity from immediately before to 10 min and 60 to 120 min after feeding with change in A-rSO2 over the same time. Spearman's rank correlation was used to ascertain if a significant association existed. RESULT Change in A-rSO2 was significantly associated with change in systolic, diastolic, and mean SMA velocity from fasting to 60 to 120 min after feeding (P=0.016, 0.021, 0.010) and from 10 min after a feed to 60 to 120 min after feeding (P=0.009, 0.035, 0.032).

By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system ($\\\\alpha=0$), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and due to direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons and their ability to produce positive patient outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30 th 2020, including any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. Results Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03 C 0.39, p<0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01 C 0.26, p<0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68 C 48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group.

PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to the ED were included. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy. We used time series methods for ED syndromic surveillance (influenza-like syndrome, droplet isolation) and usual indicators from public health authorities (new cases, proportion of positive tests in the population). RESULTS: Based on 37 319 ED visits during the COVID-19 outbreak, 1421 ED visits (3.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with influenza-like syndrome or droplet isolation in the ED showed a similar correlation to ICU occupancy as confirmed cases in the general population, with a time lag of approximately 13 days (0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80; 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.86; and 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83, respectively).

A total of 579 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in Jordan were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Genetic lineage assignment was undertaken using the Pango system. Amino acid substitutions were investigated using the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) tool. A total of 19 different SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages were detected, with the most frequent being the first Jordan lineage (B.1.1.312), first detected in August 2020 (n = 424, 73.2%).

High definition (HD) colonoscopy may uniquely aid in the detection of these inconspicuous lesions compared to standard definition (SD) colonoscopes. In the absence of existing clinical guidelines to obligate the use of HD colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening in average-risk patients, demonstrating the benefit of HD colonoscopy on SSA detection rate (SSADR) may help strengthen the evidence to recommend its use in all settings. AIM: To evaluate the benefit of HD colonoscopy compared to SD colonoscopy on SSADR in average-risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. METHODS: Data from screening colonoscopies for patients aged 50-76 years two years before and two years after the transition from SD colonoscopy to HD colonoscopy at our large, academic teaching center were collected. Patients with symptoms of colorectal disease, positive occult blood test, history of colon polyps, cancer, polyposis syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or family history of colon cancer or polyps were excluded. Patients whose endoscopists did not perform colonoscopies both before and after scope definition change were also excluded. Differences in individual endoscopist SSADR, average SSADR, and overall SSADR with SD colonoscopy vs HD colonoscopy were also evaluated for significance. RESULTS: A total of 3657 colonoscopies met eligibility criteria with 2012 colonoscopies from the SD colonoscopy period and 1645 colonoscopies from the HD colonoscopy period from a pool of 11 endoscopists. Statistically significant improvements of 2.30% in mean SSADR and 2.53% in overall SSADR were noted with HD colonoscopy (P = 0.00028 and P = 0.00849, respectively).

Our study aims in investigating changes in CPP rates and in sleep patterns in CPP and healthy controls. METHODS: CPP were retrospectively evaluated from April 2020 to April 2021. Parents of girls diagnosed with CPP during lockdown and of matched healthy controls filled out a questionnaire about sleep disturbances (SDSC questionnaire) and sleep schedules. RESULTS: Thirty-five CPP and 37 controls completed the survey. Incidence of new CPP cases significantly increased in 2020C2021 compared to 2017C2020 (5:100 vs 2:100, p = 0.02). Sleep disturbance rates did not differ between CPP and healthy controls before lockdown. During lockdown, CPP reported higher rates of sleep disturbs for total score (p = 0.005), excessive somnolence (p = 0.049), sleep breathing disorders (p = 0.049), and sleepCwake transition disorders (p = 0.005). Moreover, CPP group more frequently shifted toward later bedtime (p = 0.03) during lockdown compared to controls. Hours of sleep and smartphone exposure around bedtime did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the observation of increased incidence of CPP after lockdown measures. Additionally, CPP showed higher rates of sleep disturbances and later bedtime compared to controls. The causality link between sleep disturbances and CPP should be further investigated to gain knowledge in this association.","output":"Central precocious puberty during COVID-19 pandemic and sleep disturbance: an exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza vaccination coverage in countries of Latin America is low among priority risk groups, ranging from 5 to 75% among older people.

Focus groups were conducted among four risk groups: pregnant women, mothers of children aged <6 years, adults with risk factors, and adults aged 60 years in samples of urban residents. Adults with risk factors expressed the most detailed perceptions about confidence in the vaccine. A wide range of perceptions regarding complacency were expressed across risk groups and countries, with pregnant women and mothers showing greater concerns while convenience had a narrower and generally more positive range of perceptions. Participants from Chile and Paraguay expressed the most contrasts regarding confidence and complacency. Information and communication strategies need to be tailored for risk groups while confidence and complacency should be addressed in synergy.","output":"Influenza vaccination hesitancy in large urban centers in South America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this survey study, an online questionnaire consisting of 40 questions was directed to actively working ophthalmologists. The questions asked about demographic characteristics, working conditions and schedule, follow-up of ophthalmology patients, and levels of knowledge and anxiety about the pandemic. RESULTS: This study included 161 ophthalmologists (78 women and 83 men). They were predominantly consultant ophthalmologists (71%), with 128 living in metropolitan areas. More than half (54.4%) reported decreased weekly working hours, 52.5% were attending routine outpatient clinics, 52.8% were working in COVID-19-related units, 67.1% were performing only emergency operations, and 52% reported disrupted follow-up of chronic eye patients. Sixty-four percent thought that ophthalmologists were in the high-risk group, and nearly all participants used masks while working (99%). Additionally, 91% expressed high anxiety regarding the pandemic, most commonly due to the risk of transmitting the disease to family (83%), and 12.5% considered their level of knowledge about the pandemic to be insufficient. Forty-six percent of the participants thought that daily life conditions would normalize in 2 to 5 months. CONCLUSION: Close proximity during patient examination causes ophthalmologists concern about their risk. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of patients and surgeries in ophthalmology clinics in our country. As a result, ophthalmologists are unwillingly appointed to high-risk units.

METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative paradigm study, developed from a self-administered electronic questionnaire sent to ophthalmologists and residents/specialists in ophthalmology in Brazil, who performed cataract surgeries in 2019 and 2020, connected through social media and mail listing from local societies. RESULTS: Of the 303 participating surgeons, 159 (n=52.2%) performed elective cataract surgeries between March 20(th), 2020 to June 1(st), 2020. Among the measures adopted by ophthalmologists with the purpose of preventing viral transmission, the patients temperature was measured by 84.3% (n=134), and the verification of respiratory symptoms and contact/exposure to cases of COVID-19 by 87.4% (n=139). Most did not submit their patients to laboratory tests to detect COVID-19 (145; 91.2%). In surgery, 44.7% (n=71) used an N95 mask, and 69.2% (n=110) kept their patients with a mask.

These models are based on evidence that primarily originates from investigations in high-income countries, but it may be impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for microbiology and laboratory testing, imaging, and the use of diagnostic and prognostic models in patients with severe COVID-19 in LMICs. For diagnostic testing, where reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper or lower respiratory specimens and suggest using lower respiratory samples for patients suspected of having COVID-19 but have negative RT-PCR results for upper respiratory tract samples. We recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but, because false-negative testing can occur, recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19. We suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, until there is better evidence for its usefulness. Where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR, only if strict quality control measures are guaranteed. For laboratory testing, we recommend a baseline white blood cell differential platelet count and hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver function tests and suggest a baseline C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, prothrombin time (or other coagulation test), and D-dimer, where such testing capabilities are available. For imaging, where availability of standard thoracic imaging is limited, we suggest using lung ultrasound to identify patients with possible COVID-19, but recommend against its use to exclude COVID-19. We suggest using lung ultrasound in combination with clinical parameters to monitor progress of the disease and responses to therapy in COVID-19 patients. We currently suggest against using diagnostic and prognostic models as these models require extensive laboratory testing and imaging, which often are limited in LMICs.","output":"Pragmatic Recommendations for the Use of Diagnostic Testing and Prognostic Models in Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify lessons learned from haemophilia care experience in Wuhan (COVID-19 outbreak epicenter in China) and Tianjin (with relatively low COVID-19 incidence) in the pandemic. METHODS We compared the challenges in haemophilia management attributed to local COVID-19 containment policies, healthcare resource availability, clotting factors supply, daily living restrictions and coping strategies employed. RESULTS Wuhan was in lockdown with strict traffic controls, enforced quarantine and overwhelmed resources. Tianjin was in relatively relaxed countermeasures to COVID-19. In Wuhan, haemophilia treatment (for bleeding, prophylaxis, multidisciplinary team care, immune tolerance induction) and patient education were severely affected, while the challenges in Tianjin were less. In both cities, patients' fear for COVID-19 infection also affected their management. Coping strategy in Wuhan included channelling of clotting factors supply from hospitals to nine pharmacies; timely transfers of in-need patients to healthcare facilities by a volunteer service network jointly coordinated by the government, hospitals and the community. Although factor concentrate supply in each city was adequate, patients still worried whether there would be enough supply to last through the pandemics. Consequently, many downgraded their treatment regimens resulting in increased bleeding episodes. In both cities, telemedicine was promoted for patient care and education. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic had varying adverse impacts on haemophilia care depending on the local infection incidence.

RESULTS: Among the 1,285 HCW participants, two-thirds were female, 49.8 % were nurses, 46.4% were physicians, and 50.0% worked in tertiary care hospitals. 66.9% considered vaccination to be the most effective way to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant and future variants. The respondents however perceived social distancing (78.0%), universal masking (77.8%), and avoiding unnecessary travel (71.4%) as slightly superior to vaccination to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. HCWs aging 55 or older agreed significantly with vaccine ineffectiveness to control Omicron spread, while those who believed in non-pharmacological infection prevention measures agreed significantly with vaccination for that purpose. Male HCWs had a significant agreement with mandatory vaccination of all eligible adult populations. On the other hand, unwilling HCWs to receive the vaccine had strong disagreements with mandatory vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The current study in the first week of Omicron showed that only two-thirds of HCWs felt that vaccination was the best option to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, indicating the need for further motivation campaigns for vaccination and booster dose.

While biopolitics aims to ameliorate the health of populations, Foucault never systematically accounted for the unequal value of lives. In the name of saving the biological lives of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, the harm reduction movement has emphasized the need for safe supply, decriminalization, and housing; governments have started implementing these measures, which were previously rejected as utopian and unrealistic. Paradoxically, the use of drugs itself, and therefore the increased risk of death from overdose or other medical sequelae, is the only way PWUD can achieve enough visibility to be recognized as a life worth saving. The humanitarian rationale of harm reduction concerns itself with the biological life and stipulates social and political rights in the name of its sacredness.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed adult emergency department (ED) patient visits from five different NYC hospital campuses from March 1, 2020 to May 13, 2020 of patients who underwent nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR testing. The positive and negative COVID-19 cohorts were then assessed for different chief complaints obtained from structured triage data. Sub-analysis was performed for patients older than 65 and within chief complaints with high mortality. RESULTS: Of 11,992 ED patient visits who received COVID-19 testing, 6524/11992 (54.4%) were COVID-19 positive. 73.5% of fever, 67.7% of shortness of breath, and 65% of cough had COVID-19, but others included 57.5% of weakness/fall/altered mental status, 55.5% of glycemic control, and 51.4% of gastrointestinal symptoms.

This review will summarize the psychopathogenic mechanisms of viral infections and discuss the neuroinvasive and inflammatory properties of COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of psychotic disorders, with a focus on in utero, neonatal, and childhood exposure.","output":"Viral respiratory infections and psychosis: A review of the literature and the implications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transfer of a chemical product from its original container to an unlabelled secondary container by consumers is a potential health hazard that may result in unintentional exposures and intoxications.

The technologies used in the fabrication of both thick- and thin-film electrodes allow the mass production of reproducible, inexpensive and mechanically robust strip solid electrodes. Other important advantages of these electrodes are the possibility of miniaturization as well as their ease of manipulation in a disposable manner and therefore the use of small volumes. To detect transcriptional profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism thin-film arrays of 14, 20, 25, 48, and 64 electrodes have been fabricated, using lithographic techniques. Readout systems for these arrays based on electrical detection have also been developed. Moreover, a thick-film sensor array suitable for automation combined to readout based on intermittent pulse amperometry (IPA) has been commercialized. These genosensors and the readout instruments provide a simple, accurate and inexpensive platform for patient diagnosis. It is more than probable that arrays for 50C100 DNA sequences will be needed for some clinical applications. Although it is not difficult to design electrode pads with reproducible dimensions of a micron or less, the electrochemical readout requires mechanical connections to each individual electrode.","output":"Chapter 26 Thick- and thin-film DNA sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Workplace violence is a major concern for clinicians worldwide. There has been little data on the epidemiology of workplace violence against frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the pattern of workplace violence and its association with quality of life (QOL) against frontline clinicians during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted in China between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Frontline clinicians' experience with workplace violence was measured with six standardized questions derived from the Workplace Violence Scale, while anxiety, depressive, and insomnia symptoms, and QOL were measured using the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted. Results: A total of 15,531 clinicians completed the assessment; 2,878 (18.5, 95% CI = 17.92C19.14%) reported workplace violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (verbal violence: 16.1%; physical violence: 6.9%). According to multivariable models, key correlates of workplace violence were male gender, longer work experience, higher education level, smoking, working in the psychiatry or emergency department, working in tertiary hospitals, being involved in direct care of infected patients, having infected family/ friends/ colleagues, and frequently using social communication programs. Clinicians working in inpatient departments were less likely to report workplace violence compared to those working in outpatient departments. SEM analysis revealed that both violence and emotional disturbances (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) directly affected QOL (standardized direct effect = ?0.031, and ?0.566, respectively, P < 0.05), while emotional disturbances partly mediated the association between work violence and QOL (standardized indirect effect = ?0.184, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Frontline clinicians were vulnerable to workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the negative impact of workplace violence on quality of care and clinicians' QOL, health authorities and policymakers should take effective measures to reduce workplace violence against clinicians.","output":"Workplace Violence Against Chinese Frontline Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Associations With Demographic and Clinical Characteristics and Quality of Life: A Structural Equation Modeling Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2007 the Indonesian government claimed sovereignty over the H5N1 influenza virus samples isolated within Indonesias territories, refusing to share those samples with the World Health Organisation. Indonesias sovereignty claims conflicted with the decades-long practice of sharing influenza samples with the WHO, and was seen as an affront to scientific norms of cooperation and openness. The conflict was ostensibly resolved in 2011 with the introduction of the WHOs Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework), which was intended to secure access to influenza viruses from around the world and effect a fairer distribution of vaccines and other benefits associated with the use of pandemic influenza samples. The problem is, the PIP Framework did not resolve the issues created with the concept of viral sovereignty. In fact, by recognising the sovereign rights of states over this subset of pathogens, the PIP Framework legitimised viral sovereignty as a broader legal norm. Instead of resisting this concept, the WHO quietly acceded to it and reinforced a set of perverse incentives for countries to restrict access to pathogens precisely when those pathogens embody the greatest value: during a public health emergency. This chapter demonstrates that the concept of viral sovereignty did not begin with Indonesia in 2007, and more importantly, it did not end with the PIP Framework in 2011. Despite the term viral sovereignty fading into relative obscurity, the concept itself is now an established legal norm that could delay efforts to save lives during epidemics and pandemics.","output":"Restricting Access to Pathogen Samples and Epidemiological Data: A Not-So-Brief History of Viral Sovereignty and the Mark It Left on the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemics impact on buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) is unknown.

Methods: We used cross-sectional baseline data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study (CPAS;N=2,365). Participants were parents of children aged 18 years, residing in Australia. We drew on nationally representative pre-COVID data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC;N=9,438). In both studies, parents provided the same self-report measures of physical activity, sleep quality, as well as measures of child physical activity and screen time. Parents reported on their own and their childs mental health. Results: Compared to LSAC, children in CPAS had more sleep problems (17.4% vs 8.9%, p<.001) and more weekend screen time (3.98 hours vs 3.35 hours, p<.001), while more parents had poor sleep quality (56.7% vs 21.0%, p<.001) despite increased weekly physical activity (3.86 days vs 2.85 days, p<.001).

Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The five key themes were grouped in terms of perceptions of registrars' role in immunisation of older adults, consultation barriers, health system barriers, managing vaccine hesitancy, and a team approach to vaccination. DISCUSSION: Vaccine positivity is an important attitude to cultivate within the general practice environment as it has an impact on registrar behaviour.

However, it is challenging for both high accuracy and rapid turn-around time to coexist in testing; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time-consuming with high accuracy, while antigen testing is rapid with less accuracy. Methods: 88,924 (93.2%) of 95,457 arrivals at three international airports in Japan were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva by a screening strategy with initial chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) followed by confirmatory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) only for intermediate range antigen concentrations. Results: 254 (0.27%) persons were found to be SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive ([] 4.0 pg/mL) by CLEIA. NAAT was required for confirmatory testing in 513 (0.54%) persons with intermediate antigen concentrations (0.67-4.0 pg/mL) whereby the virus was detected in 34 (6.6%) persons. This two-step strategy dramatically reduced the utilization of NAAT to approximately one out of every 200 test subjects. Estimated performance of this strategy did not show significant increase in false negatives as compared to performing NAAT in all subjects. Further reduction in imported cases may be achieved by post-screening quarantine. Conclusions: Point of care testing by quantitative CLEIA using self-collected saliva is less labor-intensive and yields results rapidly, thus suitable as an initial screening test.

The ability of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host. In this study, we sought to understand the immunological basis for the fatal encephalitis following infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM, in contrast with the more attenuated MHV-A59. Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes. In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFN mRNA relative to IFN mRNA. This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection. Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFN production and antiviral activity. MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, MIP-1, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of macrophages in the brain on day 7 compared to MHV-A59 infection.

We screened 2,062 admissions, of which 622 were eligible based on feeding status at discharge. QI interventions included educational efforts and guideline implementation. Our primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with their discharge retHE measure within the normal range. We also tracked the process measure of the number of retHE tests performed and a balancing measure of the incidence of elevated retHE among patients receiving iron supplementation. Statistical process control (SPC) charts assessed for special cause variation. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with a retHe within the normal range was significantly increased from a mean of 20% to 39% on SPC chart analysis.

Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio&#8482; (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture. RESULTS: The specificity of all RADTs was 100 % and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80 % and 85 % for Sofia, 81 % and 85 % for Standard Q, and 83 % and 86 % for Panbio&#8482;, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90 % sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct (Cycle threshold) values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80 % of specimens with a Ct value <25. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR.

We isolated BIDVs from three BRD outbreaks, in Hokkaido during 2018-2020, to understand their genetic and antigenic characteristics. Retrospective surveillance was performed using sera collected throughout the last decade in Hokkaido to investigate BIDV existence. Three BIDVs were isolated using cell culture. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses using sequence data of the three BIDVs and IDVs from Japan and other countries available in GenBank demonstrated that Japanese BIDVs, including the three BIDV isolates, were genetically distinct from other IDVs. Genotype classifications based on the rotavirus genotype classification revealed multiple genotypes of RNA segments 1-7. Two BIDVs were of a new genotype, different from those of other Japanese BIDVs. Neutralization assays against two BIDVs with different genotypes using sera collected in acute and recovery phases of BRD revealed differences in cross-reactivity to heterogenous BIDVs. Retrospective surveillance suggested that BIDV existed in Hokkaido, in 2009. Our findings suggest that BIDVs of different genotypes and antigenicity are distributed and maintained in Hokkaido and provide new insights into molecular characteristics and the evolution of IDVs.","output":"Genetic and Antigenic Characterization and Retrospective Surveillance of Bovine Influenza D Viruses Identified in Hokkaido, Japan from 2018 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anemia and jaundice are common health conditions that affect millions of children, adults, and the elderly worldwide.

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. METHODS: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. RESULTS: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

Here we highlight the risks of Burnout and the potential protection of coping strategies in a profession that mediates the social dimension of health and disease. We aimed to understand their impact on social workers who worked in the health field in Portugal and Spain during the first wave, analyzing the levels of resilience and burnout. 336 social workers from Portugal (n = 252) and Spain (n = 84) participated. Despite the high perception of multidimensional stressors (at a personal, relational, professional, and organizational level), burnout risks were moderate to low. The predisposition to burnout due to depersonalization was residual (1.8%), but that due to low personal accomplishment (18.8%) and emotional exhaustion (21.4%) were higher;however, the majority did not show any risk of Burnout. The levels of resilience demonstrated facing the COVID-19 Pandemic were low (47%) or moderate (29.8%), with 23.2% at high levels. The aggregation of Burnout and coping strategies into three risk profiles reveals differences in the perception of fear of implications in working with patients, the impact felt at work, and the support felt at the health unit.

With higher burden of malaria in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries coupled with fragile healthcare system and delivery, these may pose a threat in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria. Free radicals have been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19 through Fentons reaction and cytokine storm respectively. METHODS: the current research comprises of seventy-four (74) participants; 20 apparently healthy controls and 54 COVID-19 patients (34 among which were co-infected with malaria). Serum levels of 8-iso PGF2 and Alphatocopherol were determined among the study participants using ELISA technique and colorimetric assay, respectively. RESULTS: results revealed statistically significant elevation of 8-iso PGF2 in COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients only, and this may be due to increase production of free radicals. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Alphatocopherol was observed in COVID-19 co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients due to increase utilization of antioxidants in counterbalancing the negative effect of free radicals generated. CONCLUSION: conclusively, SARS-COV-2 patients co-infected with malaria might be predisposed to oxidative stress and low Alphatocopherol. The increase in oxidative stress is proportional to malaria parasite density and inversely related to Alphatocopherol levels. This implies that oxidative stress is notably higher and such patients may have a severer form of the COVID-19. Increased 8-iso-PGF2 in co-infection and decreased alphatocopherol levels can reflect the severity and adverse outcomes compared to COVID-19 na?ve because of their tremendous involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases.","output":"An elevated 8-isoprostaglandin F2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2) in COVID-19 subjects co-infected with malaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The C2 domain containing protein extended synaptotagmin (E-Syt) plays important roles in both lipid homeostasis and the intracellular signaling; however, its role in physiology remains largely unknown.

Conversely, overexpression of E-Syt3 in the arcuate nucleus moderately promoted food intake and impaired energy expenditure, leading to increased weight gain. Mechanistically, E-Syt3 ablation led to increased processing of POMC to -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH), increased activities of protein kinase C and activator protein-1, and enhanced expression of prohormone convertases.

The shift in stage has been met with a shift in treatment modality because the preservation of renal parenchyma can prevent adverse outcomes. Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) needs significant surgeon expertise, and preoperative planning is imperative. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between December 2010 and September 2011, virtual surgical planning (VSP) was used in consecutive patients with renal tumors that were suspicious for renal-cell carcinoma who were undergoing RALPN by a single surgeon. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were examined and manipulated preoperatively, and an operative plan formulated. Intraoperative anatomy and preoperative 3D reconstructions were compared in real time. RESULTS A total of 10 patients underwent RALPN with preoperative VSP. Average patient age at intervention was 54.6 years and average tumor size was 4.3 cm (range 1.7-7.5 cm). Tumor laterality was evenly distributed. Nephrometry score ranged from 5A to 10P, and final tumor pathology results revealed malignancy in 80%. No complications occurred intraoperatively, and an excellent correlation was noted between preoperative 3D reconstruction and intraoperative anatomy. All patients underwent a successful partial nephrectomy with no positive margins on final pathology results. Mean length of surgery was 232.9 minutes (range 156-435 min), and mean estimated blood loss was 370 mL (range 75-1800 mL). Warm ischemia time ranged from 20 to 50 minutes (mean 33.9 min). Data regarding postoperative renal function were available for six patients with an average loss of function of 9.5% (range 2%-17%). CONCLUSIONS The implementation of this novel technology has significantly improved our ability to plan RALPN preoperatively. Tumor depth and complexity of tumor resection are assessed and the appropriate operative intervention and approach planned. Tumor proximity to vascular structures and collecting system were reliably predicted and therefore anticipated. Overall, these advantages created a safer surgical endeavor.","output":"Virtual surgical planning: a novel aid to robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Lockdowns were implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 Peritraumatic distress (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of the pandemic is not well known Aim The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown Methods We recruited patients in four groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine We used the Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients' characteristics in order to better identify the ones who were the most at risk Results The study included 1771 participants 91 25% (n=1616) were female with a mean age of 32 8 (13 71) years and 7 96% (n=141) were male with a mean age of 28 0 (8 14) years In total, 38 06% (n=674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI 14) An analysis of variance showed that unemployment and depression were significantly associated with a higher PDI score Patients using their smartphones or computers for more than 1 hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0 026) Conclusion Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high These patients are also at an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time Trial registration number NCT04337047 ? 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry All rights reserved","output":"Psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in France: A national assessment of at-risk populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDelirium may be one of the presenting symptoms of COVID-19, complicating diagnosis and care of elderly patients with dementia We aim to identify the prevalence and prognostic significance of delirium as the sole onset manifestation of COVID-19","output":"Prevalence and prognostic value of Delirium as the initial presentation of COVID-19 in the elderly with dementia: An Italian retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

RESULTS: In this study we used coronaviruses as a model to show that vRNA indeed interferes with microarray analysis, decreasing both sensitivity and accuracy. We also demonstrate that the removal of vRNA from total RNA samples, by means of virus-specific oligonucleotide capturing, significantly reduced the number of false-positive hits and increased the sensitivity of the method as tested on different array platforms.

The sample used was 115 participants who answered a validated questionnaire ( = 0.88), with questions about the e-learning system adopted by the institution. Thus, the variables that most influenced the Individual Impact and the Use of e-learning systems were User Perceived Satisfaction, which had the most impact variables on Computer Anxiety and Interaction with Others. This result indicates that the establishment of routines with interactive classes and the attention to students who may feel uncomfortable with new technologies are crucial for the success of e-learning systems. ? 2021 AISTI.","output":"Success Factors in e-Learning Systems for Students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Case Study in A Brazilian Higher Education Institution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide governments have rapidly deployed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the large-scale rollout of vaccines since late 2020. However, the effect of these individual NPI and vaccination measures across space and time has not been sufficiently explored. By the decay ratio in the suppression of COVID-19 infections, we investigated the performance of different NPIs across waves in 133 countries, and their integration with vaccine rollouts in 63 countries as of 25 March 2021. The most effective NPIs were gathering restrictions (contributing 27.83% in the infection rate reductions), facial coverings (16.79%) and school closures (10.08%) in the first wave, and changed to facial coverings (30.04%), gathering restrictions (17.51%) and international travel restrictions (9.22%) in the second wave. The impact of NPIs had obvious spatiotemporal variations across countries by waves before vaccine rollouts, with facial coverings being one of the most effective measures consistently. Vaccinations had gradually contributed to the suppression of COVID-19 transmission, from 0.71% and 0.86% within 15 days and 30 days since Day 12 after vaccination, to 1.23% as of 25 March 2021, while NPIs still dominated the pandemic mitigation.

Low- and middle-income regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa, are especially vulnerable to a negative impact on cancer resources and outcomes. We report the initial indirect impact of COVID-19 on cancer care in the sub-Saharan Africa region approximately 14 months into the pandemic. Materials/Methods At the start of the pandemic, we created a consortium of African and North American cancer centers and NGOs for the distribution of factual and timely information and data on COVID-19 and cancer care. A survey was distributed to consortium members and other colleagues from the sub-Saharan Africa region to understand the impact of COVID-19 in cancer care resources. Survey respondents represent cancer experts from 8 centers in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe. Results All sites report SARS-COv-2 transmission amongst cancer patients and staff. A total of 48 staff developed COVID-19 infection with one site reporting a single death. Additionally, 62.5% of sites report loss of oncology physician or nursing staff due to redeployment for COVID-19 care resulting in minimal (20%), moderate (60%), or other (20%) impact on cancer care. All 8 sites report a government mandated lockdown with a median duration of 2.3 months (IQR .9-4.2 months). Impact of the lockdown on cancer care was reported as none (12.5%), minimal (12.5%), moderate (50%) and severe (25%). Additionally, we surveyed the impact of COVID-19 on resources in radiation, medical and surgical oncology services. A total of 25% of responders reported decreases in radiation resources while 37.5% reported changes in medical and surgical oncology resources. For radiation oncology, the most common impact was access to CT imaging for 3D-conformal planning (25%), access to brachytherapy (12.5%), and medical physics support (12.5%). For medical oncology, the most frequent impact was access to chemotherapy (37.5%) and blood products (12.5%), and loss of oncology ward space (12.5%). The most frequent impact for surgical oncology was access to operating rooms (37.5%), ventilators (12.5%), anesthesia (25%), blood products (25%), and other supply chain issues (25%). Of centers who reported impact on cancer care, severity of impact was none (50%) and moderate (50%) for radiation oncology; mild (25%) and moderate (75%) for medical oncology; and moderate (75%) and severe (25%) for surgical oncology. Conclusion Our survey identified diffuse impact of COVID-19 on all facets of cancer care across sub-Saharan Africa. Based on physician assessment of impact, the discipline of surgical oncology may be impacted the greatest.

The current state-of-the-art 16 compartment model developed by Tuite et. al (2020) is used to simulate the influence of government policies and leverage early available clinical information to predict the dynamics of the disease. As much of the world is now experiencing a second wave and vaccines have been approved and are being deployed;it is critical to be able to accurately predict the trajectory of cases while integrating information about these new model states and parameters. Challenges for accurate predictions are two-fold: firstly, the mechanistic model must capture the essential dynamics of the pandemic as well provide meaningful information on quantities of interest (e.g. demand for hospital resources), and secondly, the model parameters need to be calibrated using epidemiological and clinical data. Methods: To address the first challenge, we propose a compartmental model that expands upon model developed by Tuite et al. (2020) to capture the effects of vaccination, reinfection, asymptomatic carriers, inadequate access to hospital resources, and long-term health complications. As the complexity of the model increases, the inference task becomes more difficult and prone to over-fitting. As such, the nonlinear sparse Bayesian learning (NSBL) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. Results: The algorithm is demonstrated for noisy and incomplete synthetic data generated from an SIRS model with three uncertain parameters (infection rate, recovery rate and the rate temporary immunity is lost). As an example, Figure 1 shows the calibration of the three uncertain model parameters within a Bayesian framework while avoiding over-fitting by inducing sparsity in the parameters. Assuming there is little prior information available for the parameters, they are first assigned non-informative priors. Before NSBL, the model (red curve) is over-parameterized, and fails to predict the decline of the (blue) infection curve. The NSBL algorithm makes use of automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors, and finds one of the model parameters to be irrelevant to the dynamics. Removing the irrelevant parameter and re-calibrating enables the model (green curve) to capture the peak of the infection curve. Conclusion: An optimally calibrated model will allow for the concurrent forecasting of many hypothetical scenarios and provide clinically relevant predictions.","output":"A sparse bayesian model selection algorithm for forecasting the transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Telemedicine use in dermatology, termed teledermatology, offers a cost-effective model to improve healthcare efficiency and access. Only a minority of dermatology practices has integrated teledermatology into their practice prior to COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the barriers and facilitators may promote teledermatology adoption. Implementation science frameworks offer theoretically driven ways to assess factors affecting teledermatology implementation. This review uses a comprehensive implementation science framework to summarize barriers and facilitators of teledermatology implementation and appraises the quality of existing research. RECENT FINDINGS: Technological characteristics of teledermatology (e.g., user-friendliness) and factors within the outer setting (e.g., reimbursement and legal considerations) were the most commonly reported barriers. No existing studies use a comprehensive implementation framework to identify factors influencing teledermatology implementation. Many included studies have a risk of bias in at least two of the five study quality indices evaluated. SUMMARY: This systematic review is the first study to summarize the existing teledermatology implementation literature into well-defined constructs from a comprehensive implementation science framework. Findings suggest future studies would benefit from the use of an implementation framework to reduce study bias, improve result comprehensiveness, facilitate comparisons across studies, and produce evidence-based resolutions to implementation barriers.

Until recently, neutrophils were considered homogeneous and transcriptionally inactive cells, but both concepts are being challenged. To date, neutrophils have been characterized based on discrete parameters including cell-surface markers, buoyancy, maturation status, or tissue localization. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers an unbiased view of cells along a continuum of transcriptional states. However, the use of scRNA-seq to characterize neutrophils has proven technically difficult, explaining in part the paucity of published single-cell data on neutrophils. We have found that modifications to the data analysis pipeline, rather than to the existing scRNA-seq chemistries, can significantly increase the detection of human neutrophils in scRNA-seq. We have then applied a modified pipeline to the study of human peripheral blood neutrophils. Our findings indicate that circulating human neutrophils are transcriptionally heterogeneous cells, which can be classified into one of four transcriptional clusters that are reproducible among healthy human subjects. We demonstrate that peripheral blood neutrophils shift from relatively immature (Nh0) cells, through a transitional phenotype (Nh1), into one of two endpoints defined by either relative transcriptional inactivity (Nh2) or high expression of type I interferon-inducible genes (Nh3). Transitions among states are characterized by the expression of specific transcription factors. By simultaneously measuring surface proteins and intracellular transcripts at the single-cell level, we show that these transcriptional subsets are independent of the canonical surface proteins that are commonly used to define and characterize human neutrophils. These findings provide a new view of human neutrophil heterogeneity, with potential implications for the characterization of neutrophils in health and disease.","output":"Single-cell analysis reveals the range of transcriptional states of circulating human neutrophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide crisis, tests with high sensitivity and specificity are essential for identifying and managing COVID-19 patients. Globally, several rapid antigen tests RATs for COVID-19 have been developed, but their clinical efficacy has not been well established. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of several rapid antigen tests (RATs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods:: This prospective observational study was conducted at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College hospital from February 2021 to April 2021 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study included the patients admitted in this hospital at the COVID-19 isolation unit or referred from the triage facility of the outdoor department of this hospital suspected as COVID-19 case. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected simultaneously. one sample was used on the spot for the RAT. The other was sent to the adjacent Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College COVID-19 RT-PCR laboratory for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The performance of the RAT was evaluated using the results of qRT-PCR as a reference.Results:: A total of 223 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 84 (37.7%) patients. Of these 84 patients, 9 (10.7%) were asymptomatic. The overall sensitivity and specificity of RATs were 78.6% and 99.3%, respectively. The sensitivity was 81.3% in symptomatic cases and 55.6% in asymptomatic cases. False-negatives were observed in 18 patients, 3 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) > 30). The detection rate of RATs was 100% when the Ct value was up to 24.

Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission.

We collected baseline patient characteristics including: age, self-identified race or ethnicity, and BMI. We assessed the time from an abnormal endometrial biopsy to surgical management, use of at least one telemedicine appointment between biopsy and surgical management, and resulting pathology results. Chi-squared test was used to compare proportions of populations and two-tailed student's T-test was used to compare days between biopsy and surgical management. P-value was set at 0.05. Results: 466 and 402 patients underwent an endometrial biopsy in 2019 and between January 1 C March 23, 2020, respectively. In 2019, 4.94% were diagnosed with an endometrial malignancy and 95.1% had resulting benign pathology;while in 2020, 5.22% had a diagnosed endometrial malignancy and 94.8% had benign pathology (p-value = 0.84). Median age was 51.0 years (range, 19.0C89.0) in 2019 and 51.0 years (range 24C89) in 2020. Median BMI was 31.4 (range, 17.6C66.9) in 2019 and 31.1 (range, 16.3C74.2) in 2020. Median time between endometrial biopsy and surgical management was 66.5 days (range, 0C453 days) in 2019 and 94.0 days (range 13.0C335) in 2020 (p-value = 0.57). Median time from biopsy to surgery for patients with a resulting pathology of endometrial malignancy was 53 days (range, 0C441) in 2019 and 87.5 days (range 13.0C323) in 2020 (p-value = 0.50).

Methods: Twelve immunocompetent AK patients underwent HPV vaccination at a private dermatology clinic in Naestved, Denmark. Prior to vaccination, all patients demonstrated a high AK burden that required regular control visits. At 0, 2, and 6 months, the patients received an intramuscular injection of a commercially available 9-valent HPV vaccine. Concurrently, patients continued conventional AK therapies at 3-month intervals. Clinical response, consisting of reduction in AK number and general change in skin appearance, was assessed by a dermatologist over 12 months following first vaccination. Results: All patients (mean age 76.2 years; 10 M and 2 F) completed the vaccine schedule. Overall, an average 85% reduction in total AK burden was recorded 12 months after beginning vaccination. Median AK burden thus fell from 56 (IQR: 44-80) to 13.5 (IQR: 1-18) lesions after 12 months. Lesion reduction was observable by the second inoculation at month 2 (34 AKs; IQR 22-80), continuing steadily until month 6 (15 AKs; IQR 5-30) and plateauing between 6 and 12 months.

What is the physiological interpretation of SpO2 fluctuations observed during normobaric hypoxia in healthy individuals? What is the main finding and its importance? There is a significant flow of information between SpO2 and other cardio-respiratory time-series during graded hypoxia. Analysis of the pattern of SpO2 variations has potential for non-invasive assessment of the engagement of respiratory control system in health and disease. ABSTRACT Background peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) exhibits a complex pattern of fluctuations during hypoxia. The physiological interpretation of SpO2 variability is not well understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SpO2 fluctuation carries information about integrated cardio-respiratory control in healthy individuals using a network physiology approach. Method we explored the use of transfer entropy in order to compute the flow of information between cardio-respiratory signals during hypoxia. Twelve healthy males (age [SD] 22 [4] years) were exposed to four simulated environments (fraction of inspired oxygen [FI O2 ]: 0.12, 0.145, 0.17, and 0.2093) for 45 minutes, in a single blind randomised controlled design. The flow of information between different physiological parameters (SpO2 , respiratory frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, heart rate, end-tidal pressure of O2 and CO2 ) were analysed using transfer entropy. Results normobaric hypoxia was associated with a significant increase in entropy of the SpO2 time-series. The transfer entropy analysis showed that, particularly at FI O2 : 0.145 and 0.12, the flow of information between SpO2 and other physiological variables exhibits a bidirectional relationship. While reciprocal interactions were observed between different cardio-respiratory parameters during hypoxia, SpO2 remained the main hub of this network. Conclusion SpO2 fluctuations during graded hypoxia exposure carry information about cardio-respiratory control. Therefore, SpO2 entropy analysis has the potential for non-invasive assessment of the functional connectivity of respiratory control system in various healthcare settings.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is used to diagnose whether thyroid tissue remains in the body. However, it is difficult for human eyes to observe the specificity of SPECT images in different categories, and it is difficult for doctors to accurately diagnose the residual thyroid tissue in patients based on SPECT images. At present, the research on the classification of thyroid tissue residues after thyroidectomy is still in a blank state. This paper proposes a ResNet-18 fine-tuning method based on the convolutional neural network model. First, preprocess the SPECT images to improve the image quality and remove background interference. Secondly, use the preprocessed image samples to fine-tune the pretrained ResNet-18 model to obtain better features and finally use the Softmax classifier to diagnose the residual thyroid tissue. The method has been tested on SPECT images of 446 patients collected by local hospital and compared with the widely used lightweight network SqueezeNet model and ShuffleNetV2 model. Due to the small data set, this paper conducted 10 random grouping experiments. Each experiment divided the data set into training set and test set at a ratio of 3:1. The accuracy and sensitivity rates of the model proposed in this paper are 96.69% and 94.75%, which are significantly higher than other models (p < 0.05). The specificity and precision rates are 99.6% and 99.96%, respectively, and there is no significant difference compared with other models. (p > 0.05). The area under the curve of the proposed model, SqueezeNet, and ShuffleNetv2 are 0.988 (95% CI, 0.941C1.000), 0.898 (95% CI, 0.819C0.951) (p = 0.0257), and 0.885 (95% CI, 0.803C0.941) (p = 0.0057) (p < 0.05). We prove that this thyroid tissue residue classification system can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis method to effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid tissue residues. While more accurately diagnosing patients with residual thyroid tissue in the body, we try our best to avoid the occurrence of overtreatment, which reflects its potential clinical application value.","output":"Classification and Diagnosis of Residual Thyroid Tissue in SPECT Images Based on Fine-Tuning Deep Convolutional Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, which has spread to over 200 countries and at the time of writing was responsible for over 650,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14,011 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent interactions between protein and ligand were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. This led to the identification of 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. Further, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complexes for the three top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, qingdainone, edgeworoside C and adlumidine, and of cathepsin L namely, ararobinol, (+)-oxoturkiyenine and 3,17-cinchophylline. Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine.

KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","output":"COVID-19 in the radiology department: What radiographers need to know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, affecting millions of people and exposing them to home quarantine, isolation, and social distancing. While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine.

METHODS: The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P<0.017 and P<0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004).
