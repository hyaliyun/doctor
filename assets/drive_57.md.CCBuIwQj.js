This approach may have serious limitations due to the instability of such complex systems under in vivo conditions. Methods: The core-shell polyelectrolyte nanocarriers were intravenously administered to healthy BALB/c mice with breast cancer. Next, biodistribution profiles and elimination routes were determined post mortem based on fluorescence measurements performed for isolated blood, tissue homogenates, collected urine, and feces. Results: Despite the surface PEGylation with PLL-g-PEG, multilayer polyelectrolyte nanocarriers undergo rapid degradation after intravenous administration. This process releases the shell components but not free Rhodamine B. Elements of polyelectrolyte shells are removed by hepatobiliary and renal clearance. Conclusion: Multilayer polyelectrolyte nanocarriers are prone to rapid degradation after intravenous administration. Fluorophore localization determines the obtained results of biodistribution and elimination routes of core-shell nanomaterials. Therefore, precise and reliable analysis of in vivo stability and biodistribution of nanomaterials composed of several compartments requires nanomaterials labeled within each compartment.","output":"Fluorophore Localization Determines the Results of Biodistribution of Core-Shell Nanocarriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerobic exercise training (ET) produces beneficial adaptations in skeletal muscles, including angiogenesis. The reninCangiotensin system (RAS) is highly involved in angiogenesis stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying capillary growth in skeletal muscle induced by aerobic ET are not completely understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of volume-dependent aerobic ET on skeletal muscle angiogenesis involving the expression of miRNAs-27a and 27b on RAS and oxidantCantioxidant balance. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sedentary control (SC), trained protocol 1 (P1), and trained protocol 2 (P2). P1 consisted of 60 min/day of swimming, 5/week, for 10 weeks. P2 consisted of the same protocol as P1 until the 8th week, but in the 9th week, rats trained 2/day, and in the 10th week, trained 3/day. Angiogenesis and molecular analyses were performed in soleus muscle samples. Furthermore, to establish ET-induced angiogenesis through RAS, animals were treated with an AT1 receptor blocker (losartan). Aerobic ET promoted higher VO(2) peak and exercise tolerance values. In contrast, miRNA-27a and -27b levels were reduced in both trained groups, compared with the SC group. This was in parallel with an increase in the ACE1/Ang II/VEGF axis, which led to a higher capillary-to-fiber ratio. Moreover, aerobic ET induced an antioxidant profile increasing skeletal muscle SOD2 and catalase gene expression, which was accompanied by high nitrite levels and reduced nitrotyrosine concentrations in the circulation. Additionally, losartan treatment partially re-established the miRNAs expression and the capillary-to-fiber ratio in the trained groups. In summary, aerobic ET promoted angiogenesis through the miRNA-27a/bCACE1/Ang II/VEGF axis and improved the redox balance. Losartan treatment demonstrates the participation of RAS in ET-induced vascular growth. miRNAs and RAS components are promising potential targets to modulate angiogenesis for combating vascular diseases, as well as potential biomarkers to monitor training interventions and physical performance.","output":"Angiotensin II Promotes Skeletal Muscle Angiogenesis Induced by Volume-Dependent Aerobic Exercise Training: Effects on miRNAs-27a/b and OxidantCAntioxidant Balance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations. Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context, especially in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered);weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.","output":"Disease spreading with social distancing: A prevention strategy in disordered multiplex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the onset of the crisis caused by COVID-19, the Mexican education system chose to join the global context and suspend face-to-face classes for all educational levels.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is one of the AR expression manifestations. AIM: To explore AGA severity as a possible risk factor for COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A total of 164 subjects (116 men and 48 females) with confirmed COVID-19 in need of hospitalization were included in this study. An experienced dermatologist examined the correlation of clinical signs of COVID-19 severity with AGA types. For evaluation of the association between categorical variables and comparison of the mean age in three groups of COVID-19 patients, the Fisher's exact test and the analysis of variance were used. RESULTS: Our cross-sectional study included 116 male patients (70.7%) with a median age of 65.5 (age range: 22-97) years. Among them, 13.8% required intubation, 15.5% needed intensive care unit (ICU) care, and 70.7% required inward hospitalization. The Hamilton-Norwood Scale (HNS) was as follows: HNS I 14.7%, HNS II 12.1%, HNS III 20.7%, HNS IV 19.8%, HNS IV 29.8%, HNS V 17.2%, HNS VI 13.8%, and HNS VII 1.7%. Also, 29.3% of the patients were female, possessing a median age of 72 (age range: 23-98) years. In this group, 8.3% required intubation, 6.3% required ICU care, and 85.4% needed inpatient ward admission care. The Ludwig Scale (LS) was as follows: LS I 52.1%, LS II 35.4%, and LS III 12.5%.

Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of infections in general, which in turn translates into increased mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective measure.

We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. METHODS: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. RESULTS: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment.

In addition, these findings need to be assessed across various observational data sources to ensure external validity. Objectives: To describe the demographics, comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 outcomes among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. Methods: A large nationwide electronic health record database (Optum, Inc.) in the United States, with data range between February 1, 2020 and September 17, 2020, was used to describe the demographics, comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 outcomes of RA patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (diagnosis for COVID-19 or positive PCR or antigen test). Patients with a single diagnosis of RA (ICD-10 code) before the diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Patients missing age or sex, under 18 years of age on COVID-19 diagnosis date, or having less than 15 months of activity prior to COVID-19 diagnosis in the data source were excluded. We described demographics, comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 outcomes, including death, hospitalization, ICU admission, and acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) identified between 14 days prior to and 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Mean and standard deviation (SD) was reported for continuous variables. For categorical variables, count (N) and proportion was reported. Results: We identified 2,948 patients diagnosed with RA and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (mean age SD: 62 years  16, 77% female, 68% white). Of all identified patients, 38% were current or former smokers. For the 2,614 patients with BMI recorded, 78% were overweight or obese (mean BMISD: 31.28.3). The mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 3.6 (SD 3.2), with 87% of the study cohort having one or more comorbid condition, including hypertension (55%), type 2 diabetes (26%), COPD (20%), moderate to severe asthma (17%), coronary artery disease (17%), chronic kidney disease (13%), and heart failure (13%).

We sought to determine whether an automated electronic medical record best practice alert (BPA) based on procalcitonin and respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results could help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in patients with likely viral respiratory illness. METHODS: This multisite, preCpost, quasi-experimental study included patients 18 years and older with a procalcitonin level <0.25 ng/mL and a virus identified on respiratory PCR within 48 hours of each other, and 1 or more systemic antibiotics ordered. In the study group, a BPA alerted providers of the diagnostic results suggesting viral infection and prompted them to reassess the need for antibiotics. The primary outcome measured was total antibiotic-days of therapy. RESULTS: The BPA reduced inpatient antibiotic-days of therapy by a mean of 2.2 days compared with patients who met criteria but did not have the alert fire (8.0 vs 5.8 days, respectively, P < .001).

METHODS: We retrospectively studied adults who received care in the outpatient Nephrology & Hypertension division at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from March to July 2020. We used a standardized survey methodology to evaluate patient satisfaction. The primary outcome was the percent of patients who responded with a score of good (4) or very good (5) on a 5-point Likert scale on survey questions that asked their perspectives on access to their nephrologist, relationship with care provider, their opinions on the telenephrology technology, and their overall assessment of the care received. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and chi-square tests were used as appropriate to compare telenephrology versus face-to-face visits.

Since COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably raised mental health concerns, one of the high risks and possibly neglected groups includes individuals undergoing mental health rehabilitation, the impact on which can be significant as compared to the rest of the population. In order to ensure that individuals on the road to recovery are not alone and forgotten during the times of coronavirus crisis they should be provided with adequate resources, such as online meetings and group therapy sessions, assessment, treatment and support by telephone and video consultation and getting the medications they need to recover. This article highlights how the coronavirus pandemic, that has hit hard the health care and all categories of patients affected by mental disorders, is likely to be particularly dramatic for mental health rehabilitation centers. Indeed, the COVID-19 crisis has severely tested the health systems worldwide, reducing sometimes the quality and quantity of care offered to psychiatric patients both hospitalized and not in rehabilitation centers. The main goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance, often underestimated, of mental health rehabilitation centers, on which one should invest for the both future of psychological and psychiatric rehabilitation and the current crisis as well.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health Rehabilitation Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Few large cohort studies have reported data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection in pregnancy. We report the outcome of infected pregnancies from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID\\\\19 (PAN\\\\COVID) study and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on NeonatalCPerinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID\\\\19 Registry. METHODS: This was an analysis of data from the PAN\\\\COVID registry (1 January to 25 July 2020), which includes pregnancies with suspected or confirmed maternal SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection at any stage in pregnancy, and the AAP\\\\SONPM National Perinatal COVID\\\\19 registry (4 April to 8 August 2020), which includes pregnancies with positive maternal testing for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery. The registries collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. The PAN\\\\COVID results are presented overall for pregnancies with suspected or confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and separately in those with confirmed infection. RESULTS: We report on 4005 pregnant women with suspected or confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection (1606 from PAN\\\\COVID and 2399 from AAP\\\\SONPM). For obstetric outcomes, in PAN\\\\COVID overall and in those with confirmed infection in PAN\\\\COVID and AAP\\\\SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% of cases, early neonatal death in 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.3% of cases and stillbirth in 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.4% of cases. Delivery was preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) in 12.0% of all women in PAN\\\\COVID, in 16.1% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN\\\\COVID and in 15.7% of women in AAP\\\\SONPM. Extreme preterm delivery (< 27 weeks' gestation) occurred in 0.5% of cases in PAN\\\\COVID and 0.3% in AAP\\\\SONPM. Neonatal SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection was reported in 0.9% of all deliveries in PAN\\\\COVID overall, in 2.0% in those with confirmed infection in PAN\\\\COVID and in 1.8% in AAP\\\\SONPM; the proportions of neonates tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2%, respectively. The rates of a small\\\\for\\\\gestational\\\\age (SGA) neonate were 8.2% in PAN\\\\COVID overall, 9.7% in those with confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP\\\\SONPM. Mean gestational\\\\age\\\\adjusted birth\\\\weight Z\\\\scores were ?0.03 in PAN\\\\COVID and ?0.18 in AAP\\\\SONPM. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the UK and USA registries of pregnancies with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection were remarkably concordant. Preterm delivery affected a higher proportion of women than expected based on historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of pregnancies affected by stillbirth, a SGA infant or early neonatal death were comparable to those in historical and contemporaneous UK and USA data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the rate was higher than expected based on UK and USA population data, which is likely explained by underascertainment of women affected by milder or asymptomatic infection in pregnancy in the PAN\\\\COVID study, although not in the AAP\\\\SONPM study. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.

This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the dynamics of country-wise growth rates of infection numbers. Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries. A better understanding of the serial and spatial dynamics of the spread of the pandemic may contribute to an improved containment and risk management.","output":"The Spread of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Time and Space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How does a political leaders messaging during a pandemic influence social distancing by citizens?

The lockdowns significantly reduced road traffic and meant that many people worked remotely. Therefore, the question arose as to how the reduced road traffic and stays of residents at home affected the degree of pollution and the structure of major air pollutants. To answer this question, the article presents an analysis of changes in typical air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) in the five largest Polish cities and one of the voivodships. The data from the Polish State Environmental Monitoring were used for the analysis. The analysis showed that the period of the first lockdown in Poland (April 2020), despite the reduced road traffic, resulted in a significant increase in PM10 emissions (9C91% during working days and an average of 30% on Saturdays and Sundays), a slight increase in PM2.5 emissions (on average from 2% to 11% for all analyzed locations), and a reduction in NO2 emissions (on average from 6% to 11% for all analyzed locations) compared to the period before the lockdown. However, the changes were not homogeneousin ?d? and Warsaw, in most cases, an increase in all analyzed pollutants was observed, and the greatest decrease in pollution took place in Ma?opolska voivodship (including Krakw). Comparing the data from April 2020 to the data from April 2019, the overall difference in the PMs concentrations was small, although there are places where there has been a significant decrease (Wroc?aw, Pozna), and there were also places where the concentration increased (Warsaw, ?d?, Ma?opolska). In the case of nitrogen dioxide, pollution concentration decreased in most locations. The only exception was the background stations in Warsaw, where the increase was 27%.","output":"Air Pollution Observations in Selected Locations in Poland during the Lockdown Related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melting snow and ice supply water for nearly 2 billion people [J.

The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","output":"Resilience of food, energy, and water systems to a sudden labor shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading in South Asian countries especially in India. India is the fourth most COVID-19 affected country at present (as on July 10, 2020). With limited medical facilities and high transmission rate, study of COVID-19 progression and its subsequence trajectory need to be analyzed in India. Epidemiologic mathematical models have the potential to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19 under different scenario. Lockdown is one of the most effective mitigation policy adapted worldwide to control the transmission rate of COVID-19 cases. In this study, we use an improvised five compartment mathematical model i.e. Susceptible (S) - exposed (E)- infected (I)- recovered (R)- death (D) (SEIRD) to investigate the progression of COVID-19 and predict the epidemic peak under the impact of lockdown in India. The aim of this study to provide the most accurate prediction of epidemic peak and to evaluate the impact of lockdown on epidemic peak shift in India. For this purpose, we examine most recent data (up to July 10, 2020) to enhance the accuracy of outcomes from the proposed model. The obtained results indicate that COVID-19 epidemic peak would appear on around mid-August 2020 in India and corresponding estimated cases would be 2.5X10^6 under current scenario. In addition, our study indicates that existence of under-reported cases (~10^5) during post-lockdown period in India. It is expected that nationwide lockdown would lead to epidemic peak suppression in India.

DESIGN Retrospective, population-based cohort study of cancer decedents between 2004 and 2015. SETTING Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS We grouped 13 085 immigrants who arrived in Ontario in 1985 or later into eight major ethnic groups based on birth country, mother tongue and surname, and compared them to 229 471 long-term residents who were 18 years at the time of death. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Aggressive care, defined as a composite of 2 emergency department visits, 2 new hospitalisations or an intensive care unit admission within 30 days of death; and supportive care, defined as a physician house call within 2 weeks, or palliative nursing or personal support worker home visit within 6 months of death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between immigration status and the odds of each main outcome. RESULTS Compared with long-term residents, immigrants overall and by ethnic group had higher rates of aggressive care (13.7% vs 17.5%, respectively; p<0.001). Among immigrants, Southeast Asians had the highest use while White-Eastern and Western Europeans had the lowest. Supportive care use was similar between long-term residents and immigrants (50.0% vs 50.5%, respectively; p=0.36), though lower among Southeast Asians (46.6%) and higher among White-Western Europeans (55.6%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, immigrants remained more likely than long-term residents to receive aggressive care (OR: 1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.21), yet were less likely to receive supportive care (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98).

Severe forms are associated with coagulation changes, mainly characterized by an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, with a higher risk of thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism. The impact of obesity in severe COVID-19 has also been highlighted. In this context, standard doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be inadequate in ICU patients, with obesity, major inflammation, and hypercoagulability. We therefore urgently developed proposals on the prevention of thromboembolism and monitoring of hemostasis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Four levels of thromboembolic risk were defined according to the severity of COVID-19 reflected by oxygen requirement and treatment, the body mass index, and other risk factors. Monitoring of hemostasis (including fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) every 48 h is proposed. Standard doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC) are proposed in case of intermediate thrombotic risk (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), no other risk factors and no ARDS). In all obese patients (high thrombotic risk), adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal insufficiency (200 IU/kg/24 h, IV), is proposed. The thrombotic risk was defined as very high in obese patients with ARDS and added risk factors for thromboembolism, and also in case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), unexplained catheter thrombosis, dialysis filter thrombosis, or marked inflammatory syndrome and/or hypercoagulability (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l and/or D-dimers > 3 g/ml). In ICU patients, it is sometimes difficult to confirm a diagnosis of thrombosis, and curative anticoagulant treatment may also be discussed on a probabilistic basis. In all these situations, therapeutic doses of LMWH, or UFH in case of renal insufficiency with monitoring of anti-Xa activity, are proposed. In conclusion, intensification of heparin treatment should be considered in the context of COVID-19 on the basis of clinical and biological criteria of severity, especially in severely ill ventilated patients, for whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism cannot be easily confirmed.","output":"Prevention of thrombotic risk in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hemostasis monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Basing on existence of the mathematically sequential reduction of the three-compartmental (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered/Removed) model to the Verhulst (logistic) equation with the parameters determined by the basic characteristic of epidemic process, this model is tested in application to the recent data on COVID-19 outbreak reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

One of many negative impacts may be on animal reproduction. Elevated ambient temperature unfavourably influences reproductive processes in mammals. High temperature can affect reproductive processes such as follicle development and may alter follicular fluid concentrations of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants defence and growth factors. These impacts may lead to inferior oocyte competence and abnormal granulosa cell (GCs) function. Mammalian oocytes are enclosed by GCs that secret hormones and signalling molecules to promote oocyte competence. GCs are essential for proper follicular development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Many environmental stressors, including thermal stress, affect GC function and alter oocyte development and growth. Several studies documented a link between elevated ambient temperature and increased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in GCs, thus altering oocyte development. Additionally, thermal stress induces upregulation of thermal shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90. This review provides an update on the influence of thermal stress on GCs of mammals. Discussions include impacts to steroidogenesis (estradiol and progesterone), proliferation and cell cycle transition, apoptosis, oxidative stress (ROS), antioxidants related genes, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and endoplasmic reticulum responses.","output":"Cellular and functional adaptation to thermal stress in ovarian granulosa cells in mammals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Explorative business process management (BPM) is attracting increasing interest in the literature and professional practice. Organizations have recognized that a focus on operational efficiency is no longer sufficient when disruptive forces can make the value proposition of entire processes obsolete. So far, however, research on how to create entirely new processes has remained largely conceptual, leaving it open how explorative BPM can be put into practice. Following the design science research paradigm and situational method engineering, we address this research gap by proposing a method called the Five Diamond Method. This method guides explorative BPM activities by supporting organizations in identifying opportunities from business and technology trends and integrating them into business processes with novel value propositions. The method is evaluated against literature-backed design objectives and competing artifacts, qualitative data gathered from BPM practitioners, as well as a pilot study and two real-world applications.

Elucidating the changes in innate and adaptive immunity during gestation may improve pregnancy outcomes and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases. METHOD: The Viral Immunity and Pregnancy (VIP) study evaluated over 50 subjects longitudinally at three time points during pregnancy and at two time points post-delivery. Leukocyte enumeration was performed; functional responses of NK cells and CD4 T cells were analyzed, and soluble factors such as cytokines, defensins, and steroid hormones were measured in maternal blood. RESULTS: In comparison to the post-partum period, the latter part of pregnancy was characterized by significant increases in blood phagocytes and pDCs and decreases in the number and activity of NK and T cells. Alterations were found in antimicrobial proteins and serum cytokines.

SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host is mediated by binding of viral spike protein to the Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is an essential member of the ReninCAngiotensin system (RAS) involved in maintaining the blood pressure and vascular remodelling. Although ACE2 receptor is the entry point to the host, recent studies show activation of ACE2 to modulate the host to develop a suitable environment for its replication. However, the ACE2 activating the immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 attachment is still under investigation. We have used systems biological approach to construct the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2 receptor. Since lungs are the primary infection site, we integrate human lung gene expression profile along with the host regulatory network to demonstrate the altered host signalling mechanism in viral infection. Further, the network was functionally enriched to determine immune modulation in the network. We also used the proteomic database to assess the occurrence of similar signalling events in other human tissues that exhibit lineage of infection across different organs. The constructed network contains 133 host proteins with 298 interactions that directly or indirectly connect to the ACE2 receptor. Among 133 proteins, 29 were found to be differentially regulated in the host lungs on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered proteins connect multiple proteins in a network that modulates kinase, carboxypeptidase and cytokine activity, leading to changes in the host immune system, cell cycle and signal transduction mechanisms. Further investigation showed the presence of similar signalling events in the kidneys, placenta, pancreas, testis, small intestine and adrenal gland as well.

Case patients, defined as travelers positive for COVID-19 on arrival, were individually matched with 4 controls for arrival date and airport or port. We assessed associations between test positivity and traveler characteristics using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 157 507 travelers arriving from 146 countries/areas at 17 quarantine stations across Japan were tested for COVID-19. The percentage of test positivity during the study period was 0.35%. In the case-control study, with 536 case patients and 2144 controls, we found evidence of lower test positivity in travelers aged 3C19 years, female travelers, and travel corridor users (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [.22C.60], 0.71 [.56C.89], and 0.48 [.30C.77], respectively), whereas higher positivity was associated with arrival from South-East Asia (1.88 [1.33C2.65]) or lower-middle- or low-income countries (2.46 [1.69C3.58] and 7.25 [2.22C23.66], respectively), any symptom (4.08 [1.43C11.65]), and nasopharyngeal compared with saliva sampling (2.75 [1.85C4.09]).

The magnetic NiCoFe(2)O(4) core was coated by a thin layer of silica, followed by a niosomal structure, allowing us to load letrozole and curcumin into the silica layer and niosomal layer, respectively, and investigate their synergic effects on breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the nanocarriers demonstrated a pH-dependent release due to the niosomal structure at their outer layer, which is a promising behavior for cancer treatment. Additionally, cellular assays revealed that the nanocarriers had low cellular uptake in the case of non-tumorigenic cells (i.e., MCF-10A) and related high viability but high cellular uptake in cancer cell lines (i.e., MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3) and related low viability, which is evidenced in their high cytotoxicity against different breast cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the letrozole/curcumin co-loaded nanocarrier is higher than that of the aqueous solutions of both drugs, indicating their enhanced cellular uptake in their encapsulated states. In particular, NiCoFe(2)O(4)@L-Silica-L@C-Niosome showed the highest cytotoxicity effects on MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. The observed cytotoxicity was due to regulation of the expression levels of the studied genes in breast cancer cells, where downregulation was observed for the Bcl-2, MMP 2, MMP 9, cyclin D, and cyclin E genes while upregulation of the expression of the Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 genes was observed.

Bivariate correlations and a multiple hierarchical regression model are performed to explain the variance of depression in WAVE3 from rumination and growth on general life events (in WAVE1) and rumination and personal growth associated with COVID-19, both in WAVE2 and WAVE3. RESULTS: statistically significant correlations are obtained between all the variables. The regression model explains 65.7% of the variance of depression (all steps significant). Both rumination (B=0.45;p=0.00) and growth (B=-0.40;p=0.00) on general life events (WAVE1) explain 54.5% of the depression in WAVE3.

METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzes data of 516 patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were categorized into three groups based on which mechanical ventilation method was used during the hospitalization period. RESULTS: Among 516 confirmed cases with COVID-19, 446 patients did not receive mechanical ventilation, 38 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 32 received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). The median age of the included patients was 61 years old (interquartile range, 52-69). A total of 432 patients had one or more coexisting illnesses. The main clinical symptoms included fever (79.46%), dry cough (66.47%) and shortness of breath (46.90%). IMV and NIMV patients included more men, more coexisting illnesses and received more medication. Patients in the IMV group and NIMV had higher leukocyte and neutrophil count, lower lymphocyte count, higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels and lower albumin (ALB) level. The univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the use of glucocorticoid, increased neutrophil count and LDH had a predictive role as indicators for IMV, and the use of glucocorticoid, increased neutrophil count and PCT had a predictive role as indicators for NIMV. The area under the curve (AUC) of use of glucocorticoid, increased neutrophil count and LDH was 0.885 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.838-0.933, p < 0.0001), which provided the specificity and sensitivity 77.7% and 90.9%, respectively.

The main risk factors for lung infections were quantified through univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Non-infectious pulmonary abnormalities (atelectasis and/or pleural effusion: 86.7 %) and pulmonary oedema (44.7 %) appeared during the first postoperative week. Infectious pneumonia was observed in 13.7 %, with a mortality of 36.6 %. Bacterial and viral pneumonia made up the bulk of infections (63.4 and 29.3 %, respectively) followed by fungal infiltrates (24.4 %).

The mean interval between T1 baseline and T2 follow-up measurements was 8.8 years with a range of 7-11 years. Measures of hearing threshold, gap detection, and auditory temporal-order identification were completed at T1 and T2. Cognitive measures completed at T1 and T2 were the 13 scales of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. Three approaches were taken to analyze these data: (a) examination of changes over time in group performance, (b) correlations and slopes between auditory and cognitive measures to examine concomitant rates of decline over the 9-year T1-to-T2 period, and (c) regression analyses examining associations between auditory performance at T1 and cognitive performance 9 years later at T2. Results For the group data, there were significant declines in hearing loss, gap-detection thresholds at one frequency, and process-type measures of cognitive function from T1 to T2 matching the trends in the baseline cross-sectional data. Regression analyses of the longitudinal data revealed the strongest connection between auditory temporal-order processing and cognitive processing typically explaining 10%-15% of the variance. Conclusions A significant amount of variance in rates of cognitive decline, T1 to T2, and subsequent cognitive performance (T2) was explained by measures of auditory function.

We noticed that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) and decreased serotonin levels in their serum when compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils, and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, whereas serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that mast cells and basophils are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Severe COVID-19 is marked by dysregulated serum levels of carboxypeptidase A3 and serotonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced human activities. Underwater soundscape variations are discussed in this study, comparing a typical and confinement day in a coastal lagoon near a popular tourist city in Mexico. Recording devices were located at 2 m in depth and 430 m away from the main promenade-a two-way avenue for light vehicle traffic-where main tourist infrastructure is located. The nearby marine environment is habitat to birds and dolphins as well as fish and invertebrates of commercial importance. Medium and small boats usually transit the area. The main underwater sound level reduction was measured at low frequencies (10-2000 Hz) because of the decrease in roadway noise. Vessel traffic also decreased by almost three quarters, although the level reduction due to this source was less noticeable. As typical day levels in the roadway noise band can potentially mask fish sounds and affect other low frequency noise-sensitive marine taxa, this study suggests that comprehensive noise analysis in coastal marine environments should consider the contribution from nearby land sources.","output":"Reduction of roadway noise in a coastal city underwater soundscape during COVID-19 confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"West Nile virus (WNV) is a blood-borne pathogen that causes systemic infections and serious neurological disease in human and animals. The most common route of infection is mosquito bites and therefore, the virus must cross a number of polarized cell layers to gain access to organ tissue and the central nervous system. Resistance to trans-cellular movement of macromolecules between epithelial and endothelial cells is mediated by tight junction complexes. While a number of recent studies have documented that WNV infection negatively impacts the barrier function of tight junctions, the intracellular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.","output":"West Nile Virus Infection Causes Endocytosis of a Specific Subset of Tight Junction Membrane Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Joint Research Centre in collaboration with the European standardization bodies CEN and CENELEC launched a scoping exercise on standardization needs in response to COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Fibrosis and the expression of the CAF activation marker -SMA were reduced by about the 30% in animals treated with anti-BAG3 mAb compared to untreated animals, and appeared unaffected by treatment with the anti-SIRP mAb alone; however, the addition of anti-SIRP to anti-BAG3 mAb in the combined treatment resulted in a > 60% (p < 0.0001) reduction of the fibrotic area and a 70% (p < 0.0001) inhibition of CAF -SMA positivity.

Moreover, we examined the moderating impact of production pressure (i.e., a contextual demand) on the relationship between emotional contagion and employee poor sleep and health. Data from 1000 employees in Italy showed that the conditional indirect effects of contagion of anger, but not of joy, on accidents and injuries via sleep and health problems were intensified as levels of production pressure increased. Furthermore, contagion of anger was positively associated with both sleep disturbances and health problems whereas contagion of joy was negatively related to only sleep disturbances.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: R package \\"DESeq2\\" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The \\"ClusterProfiler\\" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-site single-arm proof-of-concept study in which the US-based FH Foundation (a 501c3 research and advocacy organization) directly engaged with FH probands and relatives similar to the approach taken by the Dutch Foundation for Tracing FH. RESULTS: Eleven unrelated probands with genetically confirmed FH were enrolled. Mean age was 43 years; 82% were women, and 82% were of European ancestry. Prior to enrolling into the study, only 2 families (18% screening rate) were screened for FH with both lipid measurements and genetic testing. Two probands declined cascade screening due to fear over genetic discrimination. Nine total relatives engaged with the FH Foundation. Mean age was 43 years and 44% were women. Seven of those relatives (from 6 families; 55% screening rate) consented to be screened for FH with lipid measurement and genetic testing. The two additional relatives C men ages 39 and 49 C agreed to lipid measurements but not genetic testing, each noting he would like to think more about genetic testing.

In addition, severe pneumonia due to PIVs has been reported in immunocompromised adults. However, no reports have described PIV infections leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in immunocompetent hosts. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old otherwise healthy man was transported to our hospital due to worsening dyspnea. On arrival, strong effortful breathing was observed and results of arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxia. On the basis of the clinical presentation, we intubated the patient for mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation provided inadequate oxygenation. Finally, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated. Pneumonia was considered to be a cause of the ARDS, based on the patients history and blood examination. Repeated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the novel coronavirus were performed, and endotracheal aspirate specimens were cultured for bacteria and fungus; however, the results were all negative. On day 2, the PIV-3-specific antibody titer was elevated. Two weeks later, the PIV-3-specific antibody titer had increased 4-fold. On the basis of these results, we diagnosed pneumonia induced by PIV-3 infection. CONCLUSIONS: ARDS can occur because of severe pneumonia induced by PIV-3.

Construction of immunogenic and mutational heat maps revealed a direct relationship between \\"hot\\" immunogenic sites and areas with high mutation frequencies. Ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and antibody composition changes in B cell repertoire driven by prolonged and repeated antigen stimulation confer development of monoclonal antibodies with enhanced neutralizing potency and breadth.

The COVID-19 pandemic required researchers to consider if remote data collection can meet research objectives, while retaining the same level of data quality and participant protections. We use four case studies from the Philippines, Zambia, India and Uganda to assess the challenges and opportunities of remote data collection during COVID-19. We present lessons learned that may inform practice in similar settings, as well as reflections for the field of qualitative inquiry in the post-COVID-19 era. Key challenges and strategies to overcome them included the need for adapted researcher training in the use of technologies and consent procedures, preparation for abbreviated interviews due to connectivity concerns, and the adoption of regular researcher debriefings. Participant outreach to allay suspicions ranged from communicating study information through multiple channels to highlighting associations with local institutions to boost credibility. Interviews were largely successful, and contained a meaningful level of depth, nuance and conviction that allowed teams to meet study objectives. Rapport still benefitted from conventional interviewer skills, including attentiveness and fluency with interview guides. While differently abled populations may encounter different barriers, the included case studies, which varied in geography and aims, all experienced more rapid recruitment and robust enrollment. Reduced in-person travel lowered interview costs and increased participation among groups who may not have otherwise attended. In our view, remote data collection is not a replacement for in-person endeavours, but a highly beneficial complement.

OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines the development and effectiveness of a hybrid-virtual simulation-based workshop designed to improve patient care by improving clinical skills of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in detecting and managing rare and complex psychiatric emergencies. METHODS: Three clinical vignettes based on near-miss psychiatric cases were developed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and nurses in psychiatry and experts in simulation-based medical education. The workshop, SafePsych was delivered in a simulation laboratory while and broadcast via Zoom video-conferencing platform to observers. Debriefing followed each clinical scenario. Participants completed preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires to evaluate clinical knowledge. RESULTS: The workshop was attended by consultants (n=12) and NCHDs in psychiatry and emergency medicine (n=19), and psychiatric nurses (n=5). In the psychiatry NCHD group, test scores significantly improved following the workshop (p<0.001). There were significant improvements in the test scores with a mean difference of 2.56 (SD 1.58, p<0.001). Feedback from participants and observers was positive, with constructive appraisals to improve the virtual element of the workshop. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training is effective in teaching high risk, rare complex psychiatric cases to psychiatry NCHDs. Further exploration of the learning needs of nursing staff is required.

Now, determining the transmission potential and immune status among sheltering in place asymptomatic patients and clinical staff resuming their activity is crucial. Here, we report herd immunity, infective, and na?ve incidence for SARS-CoV-2 after the lockdown period, among asymptomatic medical personnel and patients in two US ART centers located in states with different COVID19 incidences. Design: Prospective multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466644). Materials and Methods: A total of 339 asymptomatic individuals (personnel and patients) were analyzed from June 18 to July 30, 2020 in two ART centers reopening after lockdown following CDC safety guidelines. In Clinic A (Utah Fertility Center), located in a low prevalence State (312 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 154 individuals were analyzed. In clinic B (Boston IVF), in a high prevalence scenario (Massachusetts, 1,462 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 185 individuals were tested. Asymptomatic individuals attending or working in the indicated clinics were tested by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and for IgG quantification on blood samples (Abbott Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), following FDA-Emergency Use Authorization protocols. IRB approval was obtained from WIRB Protocol #20201490. Results: From 339 asymptomatic individuals tested, the percentage of non-informativity was 0 for RT-PCR and 0.6% (2 out of 339) for the IgG test. Only those individuals with informative results for both tests (n= 337) are presented. [Formula presented] Conclusions: In the population investigated, our results suggest that the impact of the pandemic is far from reaching the level required to achieve herd immunity (i.e., 50% of a population). Therefore, transmission remains a risk since potential infectivity is present in 0.6% of the asymptomatic population tested. This figure was maintained despite their different geographical locations and the adherence to CDC guidelines of the IVF clinics involved. Interestingly, the two PCR+ individuals were IgG + suggesting virus persistence or reinfection that, if tested by serology alone, would be considered immune. These results together with the high incidence of naive individuals draws attention for the implementation of a consistent program of testing for COVID19 as a means of preventing reemerging outbreaks in our fertility centers.","output":"SARS-COV-2 HERD IMMUNITY, INFECTIVE AND NA?VE INCIDENCE IN FERTILITY CLINICS AFTER PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN.

By examining the mutational spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion polymorphisms, and copy number variants among 206 genes known to modulate A. fumigatus virulence, we found that CAPA isolate genomes do not exhibit major differences from the genome of the Af293 reference strain. By examining virulence in an invertebrate moth model, growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of antifungal drugs, we found that CAPA isolates were generally, but not always, similar to A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17. Notably, CAPA isolate D had more putative loss of function mutations in genes known to increase virulence when deleted (e.g., in the FLEA gene, which encodes a lectin recognized by macrophages). Moreover, CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent than the other three CAPA isolates and the A. fumigatus reference strains tested.

METHODS: This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study including consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome for the study was defined as all cause in-hospital mortality. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AF were compared to patients without AF. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age of 55 years, 55.4% men) were enrolled. Of them 40 (11.4%) had AF. Patients with AF were older; were more likely to have co-morbidities, abnormal chest radiography findings and deteriorated laboratory parameters such as D-dimer, troponin, albumin, urea. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with AF compared to patients without AF (32.5% vs. 13.5%, log-rank p = 0.002, RR 2.40).

The TEM image for our purposes is defined on 2-D information, such as the membrane having undergone proliferation and from pattern recognition suggesting that the membrane-described pattern is possibly a gyroid type of membrane. Features of the membrane were used to compute and match the gyroid structure with an existing 2-D TEM micrograph, where it was revealed that the membrane structure was indeed a gyroid-based cubic membrane. The 2-D gyroid computer-simulated image that was used to match the electron micrograph of interest was derived from a mathematically well-defined 3-D structure, and it is from this 3-D derivative that allows us to make inferences about the 3-D structure of this membrane. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a 3-D structure can be defined from a 2-D membrane patterned image and that a SARS viral associated membrane change has been identified as cubic membrane morphology.

Furthermore, the expressions of VDR and CYP27B1 were significantly increased in the LPS+VD group as compared to those in the LPS-induced group. The anti-inflammatory mechanism in NIP was achieved due to the 25-OH-VD mediating TGF/YAP/TAZ pathway, which suggested that using 25-OH-VD might be a potential strategy for NIP treatment.","output":"25(OH)-Vitamin D alleviates neonatal infectious pneumonia via regulating TGF-mediated nuclear translocation mechanism of YAP/TAZ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the context of telerehabilitation, serious games have a significant role, but creating software for serious games is resource demanding.

The genome of the Omicron VOC contains more than 50 mutations, many of which have been associated with increased transmissibility, differing disease severity, and potential to evade immune responses developed for previous VOCs such as Alpha and Delta. In the days since the designation of B.1.1.529 as a VOC, infections with the lineage have been reported in countries around the globe and many countries have implemented travel restrictions and increased border controls in response. We putatively detected the Omicron variant in an aircraft wastewater sample from a flight arriving to Darwin, Australia from Johannesburg, South Africa on the 25th of November 2021 via positive results on the CDC N1, CDC N2, and del(69C70) RT-qPCR assays per guidance from the WHO. The Australian Northern Territory Health Department detected one passenger onboard the flight who was infected with SARS-CoV-2, which was determined to be the Omicron VOC by sequencing of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Subsequent sequencing of the aircraft wastewater sample using the ARTIC V3 protocol with Nanopore and ATOPlex confirmed the presence of the Omicron variant with a consensus genome that clustered with the B.1.1.529 BA.1 sub-lineage.

High throughput experiments to identify RNA-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of RNA-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-protein interactions. RESULTS: We propose RPISeq, a family of classifiers for predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information. Given the sequences of an RNA and a protein as input, RPIseq predicts whether or not the RNA-protein pair interact. The RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. Two variants of RPISeq are presented: RPISeq-SVM, which uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and RPISeq-RF, which uses a Random Forest classifier. On two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the Protein-RNA Interface Database (PRIDB), RPISeq achieved an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. On a third dataset containing only mRNA-protein interactions, the performance of RPISeq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mRNA half-life, GO annotations) of the putative RNA and protein partners. In addition, RPISeq classifiers trained using the PRIDB data correctly predicted the majority (57-99%) of non-coding RNA-protein interactions in NPInter-derived networks from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments with RPISeq demonstrate that RNA-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. RPISeq offers an inexpensive method for computational construction of RNA-protein interaction networks, and should provide useful insights into the function of non-coding RNAs.

Predicting its progress and results is clinically important. Hence, in this study, we investigated the relationship between virus load and the outcomes in Golestan Province. Method: ology : We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 diagnosed with RT-PCR testing from May 2020 to December 2020. According to the severity of the disease, the study groups were divided into three groups: outpatient, inpatient, and inpatient with death. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. Demographic properties, Clinical characteristics, and CT values of the studied patients were compared. Data were analyzed using STATA Version 16.0 software. Results: Of 1318 included subjects, 599 were outpatient, and 719 were hospitalized. Of the hospitalized patients, 487 were recovered and 232 died. The mean age (year) of patients was 48.8118.40 and 51.9% were female. There were significant differences between the age and the severity of the disease, the mean age of patients who died was higher than other patients (p<0.001). The mean CT value of all patients was 26.804.43, which was higher in outpatients than inpatients' cases (p <0.001). We did not find any significant differences for the Ct values between recovered and dead cases (p=0.66). CT value levels were not significantly different between age and sex groups.

However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. METHODS: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. RESULTS: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were maintained on sugar alone (unfed), or fed an amino acid meal, and then midgut epithelial cells were analyzed by electron microscopy and protein biochemistry. The size and number of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells were found to decrease significantly after feeding, and several KDEL-containing proteins were shown to have altered expression levels. LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was used to analyze midgut microsomal proteins isolated from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes, and of the 127 proteins identified, 8 were chosen as candidate whorl forming proteins. Three candidate proteins were COPI coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, beta'), all of which appeared to be present at higher levels in microsomal fractions from unfed mosquitoes. Using RNAi to knockdown alpha-COPI expression, electron microscopy revealed that both the size and number of RER whorls were dramatically reduced in unfed mosquitoes, and moreover, that extended regions of swollen RER were prevalent in fed mosquitoes. Lastly, while a deficiency in alpha-COPI had no effect on early trypsin protein synthesis or secretion 3 hr post blood meal (PBM), expression of late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM was completely blocked.

In particular, it is believed to be a weapon against the spread of pandemics in the past and an obstacle in fighting pandemics in the present (COVID). However, on the evolutionary scale, deterministic death is not associated with random relationships (for example, bacteria with a particular mutation), but is a product of higher nervous activity or a consequence of established hierarchy that reaches its maximal expression in eusocial communities of Hymenoptera and highly social communities of mammals. Unlike a simple association of individuals, eusociality is characterized by the appearance of non-reproductive individuals as the highest form of altruism. In contrast to primitive programs for unicellular organisms, higher multicellular organisms are characterized by the development of behavior-based phenoptotic programs, especially in the case of reproduction-associated limitation of lifespan. Therefore, we can say that the development of altruism in the course of evolution of sociality leads in its extreme manifestation to phenoptosis. Development of mathematical models for the emergence of altruism and programmed death contributes to our understanding of mechanisms underlying these paradoxical counterproductive (harmful) programs. In theory, this model can be applied not only to insects, but also to other social animals and even to the human society. Adaptive death is an extreme form of altruism. We consider altruism and programmed death as programmed processes in the mechanistic and adaptive sense, respectively. Mechanistically, this is a program existing as a predetermined chain of certain responses, regardless of its adaptive value. As to its adaptive value (regardless of the degree of phenoptoticity), this is a characteristic of organisms that demonstrate high levels of kinship, social organization, and physical association typical for higher-order individuals, e.g., unicellular organisms forming colonies with some characteristics of multicellular animals or colonies of multicellular animals displaying features of supraorganisms.","output":"Altruism and Phenoptosis as Programs Supported by Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a novel coronavirus, affects mainly the pulmonary parenchyma and produces significant morbidity and mortality.

Oral ulcers, cheilitis, and tongue lesions were more common in patients before hospitalization, while perioral pressure ulcers, macroglossia, blisters, and oral candidiasis were more recurrent in patients during hospitalization. The first could be related directly to COVID-19, while the latter could be caused by medical devices, treatments, prone position, and immunological impairment. Conclusions: An accurate oral examination during the hospital admission of all confirmed COVID-19 cases is encouraged to recognize oral early manifestations and to apply appropriate treatments.","output":"Oral Manifestations of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Several states including Texas and Mississippi have lifted their mask mandates, sparking concerns that this policy change could lead to a surge in cases and hospitalizations. Objective To estimate the increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in Texas and Mississippi following the removal of mask mandates, and to evaluate the relative reduction of these outcomes if policy change is delayed by 90 days. Design, Setting, and Participants This study uses an age-stratified compartmental model parameterized to incidence data in Texas and Mississippi to simulate increased transmission following policy change in March or June 2021, and to estimate the resulting number of incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. Main Outcomes and Measures The increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths if mask mandates are lifted on March 14 compared to lifting on June 12. Results If transmission is increased by 67% when mask mandates are lifted, we projected 11.39 (CrI: 11.22 - 11.55) million infections, 170,909 (CrI: 167,454 - 174,379) hospitalizations, and 5647 (5511 - 5804) deaths (Figure 1) in Texas from March 14 through the end of 2021. Delaying NPI lift until June reduces the average number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 36%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. Proportionate differences were similar for the state of Mississippi. Peak hospitalization rates would be reduced by 79% and 63% in Texas and Mississippi, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Removal of mask mandates in March 2021 is premature. Delaying this policy change until June 2021, when a larger fraction of the population has been vaccinated, will avert more than half of the expected COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and avoid an otherwise likely strain on healthcare capacity.","output":"Timing is everything: the relationship between COVID outcomes and the date at which mask mandates are relaxed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although patients with severe renal impairment (SRI) typically experience more critical symptoms once infected with novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, this population has often been excluded from randomized controlled trials (RCT) for Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) treatment strategies Of particular note, all RCTs for remdesivir (VekluryR), the only antiviral treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 intervention, excluded patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min Regardless, some physicians have ventured to utilize this drug on patients with SRI, positing that the benefits might outweigh the risks of its use The intent of this literature review was to examine the pharmacology of remdesivir and evaluate the published clinical literature on the topic to determine more definitively whether it might be safe to use in this population A total of 59 articles were evaluated, seven of which contained descriptions of SRI patients treated with remdesivir for COVID-19, for a total of 176 patients Interestingly, none of the patients experienced severe adverse reactions attributable to the use of remdesivir, and none of the investigators recommended against its use While there is not yet clear evidence to suggest improvement in mortality, decreased morbidity and duration of illness are likely to lower mortality rates among these patients Therefore, these findings suggest that, for patients with SRI diagnosed with COVID-19, the benefits of using remdesivir likely outweigh the risks RCTs are urgently needed to further elucidate outcomes among this population","output":"Remdesivir use in patients with severe renal impairment?

Monitoring for risk factors and preventing dangerous behaviors that increase melanoma risk, such as tanning, are important measures for melanoma prevention. Additionally, assessing the effectiveness of various methods to prevent sun exposure and sunburnswhich can lead to melanomais important to help identify ways to reduce the development of melanoma. We summarize the recent evidence regarding the heritable and behavioral risks underlying melanoma, as well as the current methods used to reduce the risk of developing melanoma and to improve the diagnosis of this disease. ABSTRACT: (1) Melanoma is the most aggressive dermatologic malignancy, with an estimated 106,110 new cases to be diagnosed in 2021. The annual incidence rates continue to climb, which underscores the critical importance of improving the methods to prevent this disease. The interventions to assist with melanoma prevention vary and typically include measures such as UV avoidance and the use of protective clothing, sunscreen, and other chemopreventive agents. However, the evidence is mixed surrounding the use of these and other interventions. This review discusses the heritable etiologies underlying melanoma development before delving into the data surrounding the preventive methods highlighted above. (2) A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify the clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses pertinent to melanoma prevention and incidence. Online resources were queried to identify epidemiologic and clinical trial information. (3) Evidence exists to support population-wide screening programs, the proper use of sunscreen, and community-targeted measures in the prevention of melanoma. Clinical evidence for the majority of the proposed preventive chemotherapeutics is presently minimal but continues to evolve. (4) Further study of these chemotherapeutics, as well as improvement of techniques in artificial intelligence and imaging techniques for melanoma screening, is warranted for continued improvement of melanoma prevention.","output":"Etiologies of Melanoma Development and Prevention Measures: A Review of the Current Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will increase as the outbreak continues and persist even after the pandemic passes.

Symptoms can be severe and lead to the interruption of cancer treatments. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-FU-induced intestinal toxicity. In this study, well-established 3D organoid models of human colon and small intestine (SI) were used to characterize 5-FU transcriptomic and metabolomic responses. Clinically relevant 5-FU concentrations for in vitro testing in organoids were established using physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulation of dosing regimens recommended for cancer patients, resulting in exposures to 10, 100 and 1000 M. After treatment, different measurements were performed: cell viability and apoptosis; image analysis of cell morphological changes; RNA sequencing; and metabolome analysis of supernatant from organoids cultures. Based on analysis of the differentially expressed genes, the most prominent molecular pathways affected by 5-FU included cell cycle, p53 signalling, mitochondrial ATP synthesis and apoptosis. Short time-series expression miner demonstrated tissue-specific mechanisms affected by 5-FU, namely biosynthesis and transport of small molecules, and mRNA translation for colon; cell signalling mediated by Rho GTPases and fork-head box transcription factors for SI. Metabolomic analysis showed that in addition to the effects on TCA cycle and oxidative stress in both organoids, tissue-specific metabolic alterations were also induced by 5-FU. Multi-omics integration identified transcription factor E2F1, a regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis, as the best key node across all samples.

The detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria was performed by the FilmArray? Respiratory Panel. A total of 387 (72.5%) children were tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen, and 23.3% of them were coinfected with more than one pathogen. Viral aetiology was found in 91.2% (n = 340). The most common viruses detected were HRV (n = 201) and RSV (n = 124), followed by PIV (n = 35) influenza A (n = 29) and human metapneumovirus (n = 27). Bacteria was found in 8.8% (n = 47), and Bordetella pertussis was the most detected. Respiratory syncytial virus and Bordetella pertussis were significantly higher in infants less than 6 months old.

Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cases of HCWs of a non-infectious hospital (non-IH) due to a local outbreak during the \\"second wave\\" of the pandemic, despite the use of PPE. Results: 7 HCWs out of 23 employees were infected and had a confirmed COVID-19 infection. All pointed to the presence of contact at work (patients, colleagues) as the main possible contamination factor. The development of COVID-pneumonia was observed in 4 persons;2 of them were hospitalized. The most common symptoms were fever with a maximum temperature rise of 37.8-39 degrees C, weakness, chest pain, cough, and loss of smell. The duration of the persistence of symptoms of the disease was up to 16 days. The elimination of coronavirus in most patients was noted after the 10th day. Conclusion: HCWs in non-IH providing routine medical care are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to contact with infected patients or colleagues. The development of COVID-19 disease in HCWs leads to long-term disability, which creates tension in the work of non-IH.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use fund-level data from the Swedish Pensions Agency on investment choices in the PPS. For each fund, the authors use monthly information on the number of investors and holdings' market value up to November 2020. The authors also use information on the total number of portfolio changes per day. For analyzing whether PPS investors reacted to the pandemic with claiming their pension, the authors use monthly data on the number of investors of a certain age group who initiate their public pension payment. Findings: Trades more than doubled, and shifted capital from equity funds to low risk interest funds. In economic terms, however, trading stayed at low levelsCless than two percent of investors traded in March 2020 and there was no effect on pension withdrawals. The increased trading during the market tumult was disproportionately concentrated among investors in the top of the pension capital distribution. Research limitations/implications: With fund-level data, the authors cannot investigate what in particular made retirement investors stay calm in the midst of a severe market decline. Either, those investors have a long-term investment horizon as they save for their pension or particular features of the system's choice architecture induce inertia and discourage from trading. The sub-group analyses are more consistent with the explanation that PPS-induced inertia is responsible for the relatively small increase in trading activity, but future research could exploit individual level data to explore this in more detail. Practical implications: The often-criticized PPS choice architecture provided positive side effects in times of a severe market shock by shielding retail investors from committing trading mistakes when trying to outsmart the market. Originality/value: The study complements previous evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on investor activity. The small response of PPS investors to COVID-19 is in line with earlier US findings on 401(k) accounts during the 2007 financial crisis (Tang et al., 2012) and industry reports about the COVID-19 period (see, e.g. Mitchell, 2020). The authors find no effects at all on public pension withdrawals in Sweden, while evidence from US 401(k) plans indicates a small share of workers taking COVID-related early withdrawals. ? 2022, Johannes Hagen, Amedeus Malisa and Thomas Post.","output":"Trading behavior of Swedish retirement investors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multidisciplinary Heart Team (HT) remains the standard of care for highly-burdened patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and valvular heart disease (VHD) and is widely adopted in the medical community and supported by European and American guidelines.

However, H7N9 is still prevalent in poultry. To surveil the prevalence, genetic characteristics, and antigenic changes of H7N9, over 7000 oropharyngeal and cloaca swab specimens were collected from live poultry markets and farms in 15 provinces of China from 2017 to 2019. A total of 85 influenza virus subtype H7N9 strains were isolated and 20 representative strains were selected for genetic analysis and antigenicity evaluation. Results indicated the decreased prevalence of low-pathogenic H7N9 strains while highly-pathogenic H7N9 strains became dominated since the introduction of vaccine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains from 2019 formed an independent small branch and were genetically distant to strains isolated in 2013C2018. Analysis of key amino acid sites showed that the virus strains may adapt to the host environment evolutionally through mutation. Our analysis predicted additional potential glycosylation sites for HA and NA genes in the 2019 strains. Sequence analysis of HA gene in strains isolated from 2018 to 2019 showed that there were an increased nucleotide substitution rate and an increased mutation rate in the first and second nucleotides of coding codons within the open reading frame.

Here we assess these genetic alterations for the first time in a cohort from North of Morocco. METHODS: Thirty-three patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of &#8804;40 years were recruited irrespective of breast and/or ovarian cancer family history. Coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA using Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific) next generation sequencing platform. RESULTS: Overall, five BRCA germline mutations were identified (15.1%). The frequency of mutations among patients with family history of breast cancer was 16.7%. Three mutations were found in BRCA1 (9%) and two within the BRCA2 gene (6%). These are three frameshift mutations (c.798_799del, c.2125_2126insA, c.5116_5119delAATA), one missense (c.116G > A) and one nonsense mutation (c.289G > T). The mutation c.5116_5119delAATA has a founder effect in North Africa. Moreover, one variant of unknown significance was identified in BRCA2 (c.4090A > G). Most BRCA mutations carriers (80%) had no family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the hypothesis that BRCA mutations alone explain the higher frequency of breast cancer in Moroccan young women. The young age (&#8804;40 years) for breast cancer diagnosis seems to be strongly predictive of BRCA mutation status in Moroccan patients. These results will help in decision making with regard to genetic counseling and testing in the national scale.","output":"Contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations to early onset breast cancer: a series from north of Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore how COVID-19 influenced the provision of high-quality maternity care in Indonesia.

Thematic analysis was used to analyse data, and behaviour change frameworks (Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation (COM-B)) were used to identify and map facilitators and barriers influencing maternity care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen midwives working in community maternity care facilities in Surabaya and Mataram, Indonesia were included. Surabaya is in western Indonesia, with around 56,000 births per year and a population of around 3 million. Mataram is in eastern Indonesia, with around 7,000 births per year and a population of around 500,000. FINDINGS: The main changes to maternity care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced frequency of antenatal and postpartum care visits, reduced support for women, including unavailability of maternity care and reduced number of antenatal care and labour companions, changes in location of provision of care, and public health changes related to COVID-19. The main factors influencing the provision of high-quality maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic were behavioural regulation, professional role and identity, and environmental context and resources.

Conventionally, first-line ITP therapy aims to obtain a rapid response and stop or decrease the risk of bleeding by increasing the platelet count. At this point, the duration of the response, the tolerability, and the long-term safety of pharmacologic interventions are considered less of a priority. Combination treatments that simultaneously address multiple disease mechanisms are an attractive strategy to increase efficacy in acute ITP therapy. In this review, we discuss the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP patients, emphasizing the use of new combinations to benefit from their synergy. AREAS COVERED This article summarizes conventional treatment, recent and novel combinations, and COVID-19 management recommendations of newly diagnosed ITP patients. EXPERT OPINION The key areas for improvement consider the long-term effects of conventional first-line therapy, reducing relapse rates, and extending responses to achieve long-term remission. Although corticosteroids remain first-line therapy, restricting their use to avoid toxicity and the increasing use of rituximab and TPO-RAs in the first three months after diagnosis open the landscape for future interventions in frontline therapy for ITP.

Yet, our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 tropism mechanism is still insufficient.

We showed that the promoters of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were accessible in a tissue- and cell-specific pattern, which is accordant with previous clinical research on SARS-CoV-2 tropism. We were able to further verify that type I IFN could induce ACE2 expression in Caco-2 cells by enhancing the binding of HNF1A, the transcription factor of ACE2, to ACE2 promoter without changing chromatin accessibility. We then performed TF-gene interactions network and pathway analyses and discovered that the transcription factors regulating host factor genes are enriched in pathways associated with viral infection.

But as promising as this sounds, vaccinating all of the population at the same time is practically infeasible because of the limited supply of vaccines from one side and the high demand from the other side. So, the process cannot happen overnight, and this is why governments kept thinking about how they can distribute vaccines in a way that helps their citizens get back to normal with the least possible damages (infections and deaths). In this study, we investigate how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to distribute vaccines more efficiently among the citizens of a country, given their age and profession. For this reason, we created an RL agent that learns vaccine distribution strategies through its interaction with a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation environment that we built. This environment runs an Agent-Based Model (ABM) where we have agents interacting with each other and with the environment where they live and based on their behavior, the virus will spread. The goal of the RL agent was to find vaccine distribution strategies that would minimize the number of infections and deaths in the environment where our agents live. After training our RL agent for 100 episodes, we compared the best strategy that RL gave us with some of the well-known strategies that countries adopt, and we found that the RL stratezy outperformed them. ? 2022 IEEE.","output":"Towards Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Better COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The area of nasal reconstruction can be challenging for the microsurgeon, as the nose is a complex structure.

Here we describe the evolution of the respiratory compromise, ventilatory management and laboratory variables of patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) admitted to the ICU. METHOD: This was a multicenter, prospective inception cohort study including adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to 20 ICUs in Argentina between June and September of 2009 during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In a standard case-report form, we collected epidemiological characteristics, results of real-time reverse-transcriptase--polymerase-chain-reaction viral diagnostic tests, oxygenation variables, acid-base status, respiratory mechanics, ventilation management and laboratory tests. Variables were recorded on ICU admission and at days 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: During the study period 178 patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis requiring MV were admitted. They were 44  15 years of age, with Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of 18  7, and most frequent comorbidities were obesity (26%), previous respiratory disease (24%) and immunosuppression (16%). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was applied in 49 (28%) patients on admission, but 94% were later intubated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present throughout the entire ICU stay in the whole group (mean PaO(2)/FIO(2 )170  25). Tidal-volumes used were 7.8 to 8.1 ml/kg (ideal body weight), plateau pressures always remained < 30 cmH(2)O, without differences between survivors and non-survivors; and mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels used were between 8 to 12 cm H(2)O. Rescue therapies, like recruitment maneuvers (8 to 35%), prone positioning (12 to 24%) and tracheal gas insufflation (3%) were frequently applied. At all time points, pH, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Lack of recovery of platelet count and persistence of leukocytosis were characteristic of non-survivors. Mortality was high (46%); and length of MV was 10 (6 to 17) days. CONCLUSIONS: These patients had severe, hypoxemic respiratory failure compatible with ARDS that persisted over time, frequently requiring rescue therapies to support oxygenation. NIV use is not warranted, given its high failure rate. Death and evolution to prolonged mechanical ventilation were common outcomes. Persistence of thrombocytopenia, acidosis and leukocytosis, and high LDH levels found in non-survivors during the course of the disease might be novel prognostic findings.","output":"Lung Function and Organ Dysfunctions in 178 Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation During The 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vortex ring (VR) structures occur in light or hoarse cough configurations. These instances consist of short impulses of exhaled air resulting to a self-contained structure that can travel large distances. The present study is the first implementation of the second order Fully Lagrangian Approach (FLA) for three-dimensional realistic flow-fields obtained by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and provides a method to calculate the occurrence and the intensity of caustic formations. The carrier phase flow field is resolved by means of second order accurate Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) based on a Finite Difference approach for the momentum equations, while a spectral approach is followed for the Poisson equation using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The effect of the undulations of the carrier phase velocity due to large scale vortical structures and turbulence is investigated. The evaluation of the higher order derivatives needed by the second order FLA is achieved by pre-fabricated least squares second order interpolations in three dimensions. This method allows for the simulation of the clustering of droplets and droplet nuclei exhaled in ambient air in conditions akin to light cough. Given the ambiguous conditions of vortex-ring formation during cough instances, three different exhale (injection) parameters n are assumed, i.e. under-developed ([Formula: see text] ), ideal ([Formula: see text] ) and over-developed ([Formula: see text] ) vortex rings.

Immune response against B. abortus S19 was assessed at the 4th week post vaccination; antibody response by standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and cell-mediated immunity by lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Further, the macrophage function in terms of nitrite production was also analyzed. The association analysis of various BoLA-A alleles with the elicitation of immune response revealed that calves with certain defined genotypes induced significantly higher cell-mediated immune response in terms of lymphocyte proliferation with higher stimulation indices (S.I.) of 1.59 (BoLA-A19), 1.49 (A18/19) and 1.52 (HinfI-D); lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity (55.52 % in A19) and nitrite production (43.40 M in A31). It is assumed that allelic variants of BoLA-A (exons 2-3 and 4-5) were associated with the differential immune response of calves to B. abortus S19 vaccination.

Other uncommon aetiologies include tuberculosis, rheumatological diseases and post-viral pericarditis. Methods We present a case of an 80-year-old Caucasian man admitted with shortness of breath (NYHA III), skin rash, loss of weight and peripheral oedema. He had no other features of connective tissue disease (CTD) or vasculitis. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation, gout, hiatus hernia and he was on rivaroxaban, ramipril, digoxin, allopurinol, bumetanide, ranitidine and finasteride. Investigations showed NT pro BNP at 6473 ng/L, CRP at 78 mg/ dL and lymphopenia (0.42 10*9/L). He has persistent hyponatraemia at 117 mmol/L with normal kidney function. His liver function test showed alkaline phosphatase of 239 U/L and globulin at 41 g/L. His COVID-19 swab test was positive whereas mycobacterial culture and hepatitis screen were both negative. He had weakly positive ANA at 0.7 but otherwise normal autoimmune profile. The level of immunoglobulin G was 25 g/L and paraprotein of 2 g/L. His electrophoresis showed a monoclonal IgG; Kappa/Lambda ratio was 2.03. CT chest and cardiac MRI: shows constrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion and thickening, moderate pleural effusion and ground-glass changes scattered throughout the right lung which suggested probably inflammatory origin. Thoracoscopic surgery (RVATS) was done for drainage of pleural effusion, excision of fat pad and anterior partial pericardectomy. The pericardial biopsy concluded chronic fibrous pericarditis with focal submesothelial mononuclear cell infiltrate with numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes .There was no amyloid or immunoglobulin deposition or malignancy. After the operation, there was both clinical and biochemical improvement (CRP- 28 mg/ dL). He did not need any immunomodulatory therapy. Results Cardiac involvement is rapidly emerging in COVID -19 diseases with case reports of myopericarditis, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, Kawasaki disease, thromboembolism, cardiogenic shock and aortitis. The mechanism remains unexplained but it could be related to direct endothelial inflammation or the cytokine storm sequelae. In our case, pericardial biopsy concluded features suggestive of autoimmune or immunoglobulin associated disease, although there was no clinical evidence of autoimmune disease. There were no lytic lesions and MGUS was diagnosed and scheduled for six monthly monitoring. Conclusion We report a case of constrictive pericarditis with COVID-19, although this remained a differential among the co-existed immunoglobulin and autoimmune syndrome. Appropriate imaging, biomarkers and histology investigations need to be considered for rapid evaluation and escalation of treatment. Cardiac manifestations are an important feature of COVID- 19.

The tremendous rise in the use of social media have made them acquire a leading role as an information source, thus representing a crucial factor at play that could contribute to increase or mitigate vaccine hesitancy, as information sources play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and perceptions. The aims of the study were to investigate if information sources could affect the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and if they could act as a mediator in the relationship between individual characteristics and vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted by a professional panellist on a representative sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy in January 2021. A mediation analysis using structural equation modelling was performed. Our results show how social media directly or indirectly increases vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination, while the opposite effect was observed for institutional websites. Given the global widespread use of social media, their use should be enhanced to disseminate scientifically sound information to a greater audience to counteract vaccine hesitancy, while at the same time continuing to promote and update institutional websites that have proven to be effective in reducing vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Vaccine Hesitancy towards COVID-19 Vaccination: Investigating the Role of Information Sources through a Mediation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the cause of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has shown to produce a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations.

DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety.

Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: U-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05).

Many factors were not known about The Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic because it is a novel human pathogen. One key factor that was not known in the earliest days of the pandemic was that many patients are either asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild that they may not seek medical attention and hence these patients would not be identified as a \\"case\\" if that term is defined as being sufficiently symptomatic to be seeking medical attention. Cases in the earliest days of the pandemic were defined as based on having symptoms (eg, fever, cough, respiratory distress) after ruling out other possible causes. Cases now are defined by tests confirming that the person is shedding the SARS-CoV-2 (ie, a laboratory vs. a symptomatic diagnosis). The mortality rate of this virus dropped as a function of this change. On the basis of the results of an unintended, naturalistic experiment on an expeditionary cruise in March of 2020, there was more than a 5-fold drop in the calculated mortality rate due to this definitional change in what constituted a case.

Our previous work covers naphthazarin, the parent compound of two systems discussed in the current work: 2,3-dimethylnaphthazarin (1) and 2,3-dimethoxy-6-methylnaphthazarin (2). Intramolecular hydrogen bonds and substituent effects in these compounds were analyzed on the basis of Density Functional Theory (DFT), M?ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2), Coupled Clusters with Singles and Doubles (CCSD) and Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). The simulations were carried out in the gas and crystalline phases. The nuclear quantum effects were incorporated a posteriori using the snapshots taken from ab initio trajectories. Further, they were used to solve a vibrational Schr?dinger equation. The proton reaction path was studied using B3LYP, B97XD and PBE functionals with a 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set. Two energy minima (deep and shallow) were found, indicating that the proton transfer phenomena could occur in the electronic ground state. Next, the electronic structure and topology were examined in the molecular and proton transferred (PT) forms. The Atoms In Molecules (AIM) theory was employed for this purpose. It was found that the hydrogen bond is stronger in the proton transferred (PT) forms. In order to estimate the dimers' stabilization and forces responsible for it, the Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) was applied. The energy decomposition revealed that dispersion is the primary factor stabilizing the dimeric forms and crystal structure of both compounds. The CPMD results showed that the proton transfer phenomena occurred in both studied compounds, as well as in both phases. In the case of compound 2, the proton transfer events are more frequent in the solid state, indicating an influence of the environmental effects on the bridged proton dynamics. Finally, the vibrational signatures were computed for both compounds using the CPMD trajectories. The Fourier transformation of the autocorrelation function of atomic velocity was applied to obtain the power spectra. The IR spectra show very broad absorption regions between 700 cm-1-1700 cm-1 and 2300 cm-1-3400 cm-1 in the gas phase and 600 cm-1-1800 cm-1 and 2200 cm-1-3400 cm-1 in the solid state for compound 1. The absorption regions for compound 2 were found as follows: 700 cm-1-1700 cm-1 and 2300 cm-1-3300 cm-1 for the gas phase and one broad absorption region in the solid state between 700 cm-1 and 3100 cm-1. The obtained spectroscopic features confirmed a strong mobility of the bridged protons.

Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha-1, especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PM enhanced grain yield and net economic return while lowering the N footprint without increasing Nr emission.

RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of \\"COVID+ units\\". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","output":"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To seek patients' feedback on their wellbeing and the service adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic To obtain carers views on service adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To establish impact on patients' wellbeing and progress in the context of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented challenges faced by healthcare systems worldwide. Public Health England (PHE) provided guidance to manage the spread of the virus. In response to the national lockdown, the Forensic Healthcare Service part of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) took measures that were considered necessary to prevent the risk of spread to patients and staff. Restrictions necessary to contain the virus included immediate suspension of all patients leave except emergency leave, suspension of visits by family members and professionals including legal visits and restrictions on multidisciplinary (MDT) members physically present on the wards. It was necessary to adapt our existing model of care to reflect and represent the challenges faced by such restrictions. A service evaluation project was undertaken to ascertain the patients' and carers perspectives of the management of restrictions. METHOD: Standards It is noteworthy that no service standards in the context of this unique global pandemic were available internationally, nationally or regionally at the time of undertaking the project. Methodology / Data collection An anonymous patient feedback questionnaire was developed to collect data on voluntary basis from all the inpatients within the secure and forensic CDS. Patients' feedback was broadly divided in to three sections 1) personal factors, 2) satisfaction with access to information and 3) satisfaction with services to include mental and physical well-being. Patients' feedback was collected during a 6-week period. For observation purposes, risk comparison anonymous data were also collected. Informal Carers' feedback was collected with regard to virtual visits. RESULT: During the data collection period 99 out of 105 beds were occupied. The response rate was 49% (49 responders). Overall 73% of responders expressed that their mental health was affected. Approximately 51% of responders expressed that progress towards their discharge was very much affected. 91% of responders were not coping well with the new circumstances Overall, carers' feedback was positive in regard to provision of virtual visits. CONCLUSION: Our survey has shown that the necessary COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have in some domains resulted in a negative impact on patients mental wellbeing and progression. However, it also identifies positive areas of new practice, which have been maintained by the service.","output":"Coping with and management of COVID-19 restrictions within the secure and forensic inpatient setting - a patients' and carers perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to stressful environments weakens immunity evidenced by a detectable reactivation of dormant viruses.

We performed next generation sequencing from RNA extracted from blood samples of 8 male subjects collected before, during and after a 12-month stay at the Antarctic station Concordia. RNA-seq data analysis was done using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Data revealed the inactivation of key immune functions such as chemotaxis and leukocyte recruitment which persisted after return. Next to the activation of the stress response eIF2 pathway, interferon signaling was predicted inactivated due to a downregulation of 14 downstream genes involved in antiviral immunity. Among them, the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFITM2 and 3 as well as IFIT3 exhibited the strongest fold changes and IFIT3 remained downregulated even after return. Impairment of antiviral immunity in winter-over crew can be explained by the downregulation of a battery of ISGs.","output":"Exploratory RNA-seq analysis in healthy subjects reveals vulnerability to viral infections during a 12- month period of isolation and confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are at risk for resource-intensive outcomes including mechanical ventilation (MV), renal replacement therapy (RRT), and readmission. Accurate outcome prognostication could facilitate hospital resource allocation. We develop and validate predictive models for each outcome using retrospective electronic health record data for COVID-19 patients treated between March 2 and May 6, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each outcome, we trained 3 classes of prediction models using clinical data for a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)Cpositive patients (n = 2256). Cross-validation was used to select the best-performing models per the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. Models were validated using a held-out cohort (n = 855). We measured each models calibration and evaluated feature importances to interpret model output. RESULTS: The predictive performance for our selected models on the held-out cohort was as follows: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curveMV 0.743 (95% CI, 0.682-0.812), RRT 0.847 (95% CI, 0.772-0.936), readmission 0.871 (95% CI, 0.830-0.917); area under the precision-recall curveMV 0.137 (95% CI, 0.047-0.175), RRT 0.325 (95% CI, 0.117-0.497), readmission 0.504 (95% CI, 0.388-0.604). Predictions were well calibrated, and the most important features within each model were consistent with clinical intuition. DISCUSSION: Our models produce performant, well-calibrated, and interpretable predictions for COVID-19 patients at risk for the target outcomes. They demonstrate the potential to accurately estimate outcome prognosis in resource-constrained care sites managing COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We develop and validate prognostic models targeting MV, RRT, and readmission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients which produce accurate, interpretable predictions. Additional external validation studies are needed to further verify the generalizability of our results.","output":"Development and validation of prediction models for mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and readmission in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p19 matrix (MA) protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was exposed on the surface of MOLT-4#8 cells in the very early step of the virus infection. Transfer of the virus-binding MOLT-4#8 cells from 4C to 37C resulted in increased detection of the viral gp46 and p19 MA protein on the cells, which was, however, inhibited by 4C or cytochalasin B treatment. These data showed that increased temperature and fluidity of the cell membrane were required for the increased detection of gp46 and p19 after viral adsorption. On the other hand, exposure of the p19 MA protein was not observed on the virus-treated U937 cells although gp46 was detected. This was not due to inefficient binding of the HTLV-I to the U937 cells, since the methanol-fixed cells were p19 MA protein-positive. MOLT-4#8 cells induced marked cell fusion when co-cultured with MT-2 cells, but U937 cells induced no fusion. All of these results indicated that these two cell lines differed in the property of plasma membrane in terms of degradation of HTLV-I envelope after viral adsorption. Uncoating of the HTLV-I might occur on the plasma membrane, especially on MOLT-4#8 cells.","output":"Exposure of p19 matrix protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) on the surface of MOLT-4#8 cells after virus adsorption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer is the most common cause of death in adults.

Apart from the respiratory manifestations, CoVs are also responsible for infections of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous systems. Their propensity to recombine allows them to easily transmit and adapt to new hosts. The emergence of a new CoV in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is attributed to a zoonotic origin, has provoked numerous studies to assess its pathogenicity for different animal species (pets, farm and wild animals). Available results indicate that numerous animal species are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. From April 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks was reported in the Netherlands, to the end of January 2021, further outbreaks have been confirmed in Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Greece, France, Canada, Lithuania and Poland. It has also been established that human-to-minks and minks-to-human transmission may occur. The results obtained to date indicate that the virus was originally introduced into the minks population by humans, possibly at the start of the pandemic and had been circulating in the population for several weeks before detection. Recent data indicate that minks are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the route or routes of virus transmission between farms, other than by direct contact with infected humans, have not been identified. In minks, infection can occur in clinical and subclinical form, making it possibly difficult to detect. Therefore, minks could represent potentially dangerous, not always recognized, animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The current data indicate that further studies on minks and other Mustelidae are needed to clarify whether they may be a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and if so, how and whether this can be prevented.","output":"Review: SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks - an overview of current knowledge on occurrence, disease and epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Axolotls are uniquely able to resolve spinal cord injuries, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying spinal cord regeneration. We previously found that tail amputation leads to reactivation of a developmental-like program in spinal cord ependymal cells (Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015), characterized by a high-proliferation zone emerging 4 days post-amputation (Rost et al., 2016). What underlies this spatiotemporal pattern of cell proliferation, however, remained unknown. Here, we use modeling, tightly linked to experimental data, to demonstrate that this regenerative response is consistent with a signal that recruits ependymal cells during ~85 hours after amputation within ~830 m of the injury. We adapted Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) technology to axolotls (AxFUCCI) to visualize cell cycles in vivo. AxFUCCI axolotls confirmed the predicted appearance time and size of the injury-induced recruitment zone and revealed cell cycle synchrony between ependymal cells.

Unlike other vaccine-preventable diseases where individuals may have experienced reduced risk due to COVID-related mitigation efforts (e.g., lockdown restrictions, use of face masks), individuals remained at risk of herpes zoster (HZ). This study projects the impact of reduced recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) use on HZ cases and complications in the US. Methods A multi-cohort Markov model estimated the impact of missed RZV vaccinations, by comparing scenarios with and without missed vaccinations between Apr-Dec 2020, on cases of HZ, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) among US adults aged  50 years. Epidemiology, RZV efficacy, and utility inputs were obtained from standard US sources, clinical trial data, and published literature. Missed doses were estimated using data on RZV doses and an assumed 43% reduction in RZV vaccinations during the pandemic, based on publicly available data. Deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. Results In 2020, approximately 21 million (M) RZV distributed doses were expected, including an estimated 9.2M RZV series initiations in Apr-Dec. An estimated 3.9M RZV series initiations were missed, resulting in 31,945 projected HZ cases, 2,714 PHN cases, and 610 lost QALYs projected over a 1-year follow up. If individuals with missed RZV initiations remain unvaccinated in 2021, avoidable HZ cases will increase to 63,117 over 2 years. Further, if the same number of RZV initiations are missed in 2021, 95,062 avoidable HZ cases are expected. In a sensitivity analysis assuming 30% RZV reduction, 18,020 avoidable HZ cases and 1,531 PHN cases were observed over 1 year. Conclusion Adding to the substantial COVID-19 infection-related morbidity and mortality, reduced RZV use during the pandemic resulted in further burden from avoidable HZ cases. Health care providers should continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination against HZ and other preventable diseases during the pandemic.

The physician assistant (PA) profession has historically not employed a profession-specific entrance exam, and the idea was never seriously explored until the Physician Assistant College Admissions Test was developed recently by a commercial assessment publisher, with field testing in some volunteer programs in 2018 and the exam's first administration in May of 2020. The 2020 Physician Assistant Education Association Presidents Commission chose to investigate the issues raised by a consensus-derived, PA-specific entrance exam to stimulate more informed discussion on the efficacy of such an exam. While it may have the potential to enhance efficiency in PA admissions and reduce variability in admissions requirements, a PA entrance exam would also likely introduce new challenges, including increased costs, impact on the diversity of the applicant pool, and incongruence with an increasingly holistic admissions process. The biggest barrier would likely be the lack of current consensus on the knowledge, skills, and attributes that matriculants need to be successful in the program and in clinical practice. Development of a consensus-derived PA entrance exam would be a complex, expensive, and time-consuming endeavor, requiring considerable attention to technical issues of psychometric quality, process transparency, and legal defensibility.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the influence of time pressure on the emotional exhaustion of front-line healthcare workers, and explore the effects of social sharing and cognitive reappraisal on this. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020. A total of 232 questionnaires were completed by front-line healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Hierarchical linear regression and conditional process analysis were performed to explore the relationships among time pressure, social sharing, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional exhaustion. RESULTS: Time pressure was positively associated with social sharing and emotional exhaustion. Social sharing presented the dark side, a negative effect that was always kept concealed, in terms of the impact on emotional exhaustion. Cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between time pressure and social sharing, and it further indirectly influenced the relationship between time pressure and emotional exhaustion through social sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on how time pressure influences the emotional exhaustion of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 period. Although social sharing is commonly regarded as a positive behavior, we identified a dark side in terms of its impact. We also identified that improving cognitive reappraisal may present a positive strategy toward alleviating emotional exhaustion.","output":"Emotional exhaustion in front-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China: the effects of time pressure, social sharing and cognitive appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to observed increases in reported mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. There is evidence attentional bias is associated with depression and anxiety, and it has been further suggested that anxiety sensitivity has a role in both the development and maintenance of depression and anxiety symptoms. Understanding these relationships may help inform preventative interventions for those at risk of mental health concerns. The present study explores the role of anxiety sensitivity, specifically physical and cognitive concerns, as a potential mediator of the relationship between attentional bias with depression and anxiety symptoms. Method Participants (n = 460) were recruited from the general population in China, and completed an online survey between February and March, 2020 which included the Attention to Positive and Negative Information Scale (APNI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). After exploring the correlations between the measures, mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of anxiety sensitivity (physical and cognitive subscales) in the relationship between attentional bias and depression and anxiety (as measured by the DASS-21). Results The results indicated that negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with physical and cognitive concerns, physical and cognitive concerns were significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety, and negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety (all ps < 0.001). Physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between negative attention bias and both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusion Negative bias was associated with levels of anxiety and depression, and physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated associations between negative bias and anxiety and depression symptoms. The study provides theoretical support for intervention and guidance on individual mental health during the pandemic, and helps individuals increase their concern to negative emotions.","output":"The Relationship Between Attentional Bias, Anxiety Sensitivity, and Depression and Anxiety Symptoms: Evidence From the COVID-19 Pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the trends in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Tokyo and Osaka from January 25 to May 06, 2020.

METHODS We conducted a systematic search across three electronic databases in May 2020 and we carried out a second search across five electronic databases in January 2021. A narrative synthesis was conducted across eligible studies. RESULTS We identified the same six studies from both searches, with 133 individuals with SMHD and experiences of cancer care and 102 healthcare professionals. Key barriers to cancer care were related to patients' uncontrolled psychiatric symptoms and the adverse impact of their symptoms on engaging with cancer care; clinician barrier-attitudes included stigmatising attitudes from clinicians and other staff towards individuals with SMHD and systems barrier-fragmentation included the fragmentation of mental health and cancer care delivery. Key patient facilitators to accessing cancer care and completing cancer treatment included being connected with mental health services and controlled psychiatric symptoms. Stronger collaboration among healthcare professionals working across different sectors in addition to the development of a patient navigator role were identified as key facilitators to enhance patient care.

The 1000 Genomes Project recorded individual genotypes across 26 different populations and, using computerized genotype phasing, reported haplotype data. In contrast, we identified long reference sequences by analyzing the homozygous genomic regions in this online database, a concept that has rarely been reported since next generation sequencing data became available. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Phased genotype data for a 80.6 kb region of chromosome 1 was downloaded for all 2,504 unrelated individuals of the 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 cohort. The data was centered on the ACKR1 gene and bordered by the CADM3 and FCER1A genes. Individuals with heterozygosity at a single site or with complete homozygosity allowed unambiguous assignment of an ACKR1 haplotype. A computer algorithm was developed for extracting these haplotypes from the 1000 Genome Project in an automated fashion. A manual analysis validated the data extracted by the algorithm. RESULTS: We confirmed 902 ACKR1 haplotypes of varying lengths, the longest at 80,584 nucleotides and shortest at 1,901 nucleotides. The combined length of haplotype sequences comprised 19,895,388 nucleotides with a median of 16,014 nucleotides. Based on our approach, all haplotypes can be considered experimentally confirmed and not affected by the known errors of computerized genotype phasing. CONCLUSIONS: Tracts of homozygosity can provide definitive reference sequences for any gene. They are particularly useful when observed in unrelated individuals of large scale sequence databases.

First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact checking.

Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic.

There are consistent technical efforts for making systems more explainable by reducing their opaqueness and increasing their interpretability and explainability. In this paper, we explore an alternative non-technical approach towards explainability that complement existing ones. Leaving aside technical, statistical, or data-related issues, we focus on the very conceptual underpinnings of the design decisions made by developers and other stakeholders during the lifecycle of a machine learning project. For instance, the design and development of an app to track snoring to detect possible health risks presuppose some picture or another of health, which is a key notion that conceptually underpins the project. We take it as a premise that these key concepts are necessarily present during design and development, albeit perhaps tacitly. We argue that by providing justificatory explanations about how the team understands the relevant key concepts behind its design decisions, interested parties could gain valuable insights and make better sense of the workings and outcomes of systems. Using the concept of health, we illustrate how a particular understanding of it might influence decisions during the design and development stages of a machine learning project, and how making this explicit by incorporating it into ex-post explanations might increase the explanatory and justificatory power of these explanations.

Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center. METHODS: An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into \\"high risk,\\" \\"intermediate risk,\\" and \\"undetermined risk\\" for both isolation and testing. RESULTS: A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died. About 1.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10.3% to the general ward, and 6.4% were isolated. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 (0.1%) and 127 (3.4%) tested positive for atypical infection; 1471 patients were tested for COVID-19; 583 were stratified as high-risk, 781 as intermediate-risk, and 107 as undetermined-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Rapid response for infection control is a paramount in the ED to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. The FFS helped divide the flow of high- and intermediate-risk patients; it also decreased the ED workload during a surge of febrile patients. A graded approach to testing uses risk stratification to prevent nosocomial infection of asymptomatic patients. A graded approach to isolation enables efficient allocation of scarce medical resources according to risk stratification.","output":"Emergency department response to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak with a fever screening station and \\"graded approach\\" for isolation and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parental Reflective Functioning (PRF) refers to parents capacity to view their childs and their own behavior considering inner mental states, like thoughts, desires, and intentions.

The sample was comprised of 685 Iranian mothers with preschoolers (3 to 5 years old) and school-aged (6C10 years old) children. To assess PRF, the PRF questionnaire was used. Child internalizing and externalizing difficulties were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, and maternal depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory- second version. Results indicated significant relationships between maternal depression and PRF (specifically pre-mentalizing and certainty in mental states). Also, mothers of school-aged children showed significantly higher levels of pre-mentalizing than mothers of preschoolers. Furthermore, certainty about mental states moderated the relationship between maternal depression and child externalizing behaviors in school-aged children.

Although there is increased understanding of clinical factors associated with severe disease, studies investigating biomarkers to predict severity and uncover treatment targets are still needed. Polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipid mediators (PUFA-LM) can promote inflammation or resolution of inflammation. Previous research showed differences in PUFA-LM expression in septic patients that developed ARDS. Here we evaluate the plasma PUFA-LM profile at admission in 20 patients with COVID-19 and correlate our findings with disease severity. Methods: Blood was collected at admission from 41 patients with COVID-19 at Virginia Commonwealth University between April and July, 2020. Platelet poor plasma from 20 patients were selected;10 with nonsevere COVID19 (NSC) defined by &lt;4L O2 need and 10 severe COVID-19 subjects (SC) defined as requiring admission to the intensive care unit, for PUFA-LM analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Patients with active malignancy were excluded. Results: Demographic data and comorbidities are similar between the two groups. Both cohorts were predominately African American (80%) and male (60%). The SC cohort exhibited higher levels of lipoxygenase metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs) and hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (HDoHEs), which serve as intermediates in the synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Epoxygenase metabolites were also higher in the SC cohort and were mostly diols indicating elevated epoxide hydrolase activity. Conversely PGE1 and 15-OxoETE were elevated in the NSC cohort compared to SC. Discussion: In this predominantly African-American patient cohort, admission PUFA-LM profiles differed in subjects who developed mild vs. severe COVID19. Higher levels of lipoxygenase activity in the SC cohort is of unclear significance since this pathway promotes synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Given sample collection early in the disease course it may signify incomplete synthesis of resolution mediators or increased inflammation. The higher levels of diols from epoxides are intriguing. PUFA epoxides are anti-inflammatory and prevent prostaglandins from eliciting an inflammatory response. Hence, higher levels of epoxide hydrolysis in SC cohort suggests an exacerbation of inflammation by prostaglandins. Higher levels of PGE1 (a known pulmonary vasodilator) and 15-OxoETE (an anti-inflammatory mediator which inhibits NFB activation) in the NSC group may contribute to a dampening of inflammatory response in NSC cohort. Overall, this data suggests a complex interplay of dysfunctional homeostatic and inflammatory mechanisms early in disease which may contribute to development of severe COVID-19.","output":"Fatty acyl lipidomic changes converge towards increased inflammation with severity of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to stigma and discrimination among various groups of people in different populations.

Baseline data were collected on first-year students after program start, and data were collected for all years of study at the end of the academic terms. RESULTS: Compared with other undergraduate students, nursing students exhibited strengths in study skills, in self-organization strategies, in their certainty of progress toward career goals, in recognizing the importance of their studies, and in levels of socializing that did not hinder academic performance. At some data collection points, they had strengths in motivation, confidence, and concentration. Nursing students indicated areas for remediation in studying or test-taking anxiety and their perception of the educator's ability to organize, teach, and assess student progress.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TurmXTRA(R) 60N (WDTE60N) on DOMS in comparison with placebo in recreationally active healthy subjects. Methods: The present study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. Thirty healthy and recreationally active subjects (average age: 28.23{+/-}4.20 years) were randomized to receive WDTE60N (WDTE60N group; n=15) or placebo (placebo group; n=15). Study treatments were initiated 29 days prior to the eccentric exercise and continued for 4 days after the exercise. Primary endpoint was the change in pain intensity measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) at the end of study treatment (at 96 hours after eccentric exercise) from baseline (measured immediately after exercise). Results The VAS score indicated that subjects from the WDTE60N group reported significantly less pain after eccentric exercise compared to placebo group (AUC0-96h: 286.8{+/-}46.7 vs. 460{+/-}40.5, respectively; p<0.0001).

The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. AIM: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","output":"A study of ethnic, gender and educational differences in attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Israel C implications for vaccination implementation policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioma are the most common malignant central nervous system tumor and are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to therapy.

The primary endpoints were the stone expulsion rate (SER) and stone-free rate (SFR). The average stone expulsion time (SET), average stone-free time (SFT) and complications were recorded. Between July 2, 2019, and December 17, 2020, 220 participants successfully underwent RIRS across 6 centers; 123 of them were randomized according to the exclusion criteria, and 102 (83%) were included in the primary analysis. The SERs on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 28th days were significantly increased in the NMT capsule group compared with the control group (78.95% vs. 31.11%, 92.98% vs. 55.56%, 94.74% vs. 64.44%, 100% vs. 82.22%, respectively, p < 0.05).

The syndrome affects newborn calves and is characterized by pancytopenia, severe bleeding and high lethality. So far, a causative role of infectious or toxic agents has been ruled out. Instead, the syndrome is induced after ingestion of colostrum, the first milk that supplies the calf with maternal antibodies. In analogy to similar diseases in humans it has therefore been postulated that BNP is caused by alloreactive, maternal antibodies. There is a striking association between BNP and a previous vaccination of the respective dams with a particular vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhoea (BVD). This association has led to a suspension of the marketing authorisation for the vaccine, by the European Commission. The current study investigates the role of this vaccine in the pathogenesis of BNP. By flow cytometry we were able to demonstrate that sera of BNP dams (dams that gave birth to a BNP calf) harbour alloreactive antibodies binding to surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. A significantly weaker alloreactivity was observed with sera of non-BNP dams that have been vaccinated with the same vaccine but delivered healthy calves. No binding was seen with non-BVD-vaccinated control cows and animals that were vaccinated with other inactivated BVD vaccines so far not associated with BNP. The binding is functionally relevant, because opsonization of bovine leukocytes with alloantibodies led to an elevated cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. To test whether the vaccine induces alloreactive antibodies two strategies were employed: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with a panel of commercially available BVD-vaccines. Only the incriminated vaccine induced antibodies binding surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. Additionally, two calves were repeatedly vaccinated with the suspected vaccine and the development of alloreactivity was monitored. In dependence of the number of booster immunizations the induction of alloreactive antibodies could be observed. Finally, by affinity purification we were able to directly demonstrate that BNP associated alloantibodies cross react with the bovine kidney cell line used for vaccine production. Together this provides strong evidence that this particular BVD vaccine has the potential to induce BNP associated alloantibodies.","output":"Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia: Is this alloimmune syndrome caused by vaccine-induced alloreactive antibodies?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Il s'agit, grace aux recherches sur et pour la biodiversit, de contribuer  transformer les systmes agri-alimentaires pour assurer la scurit alimentaire et nutritionnelle, en particulier via la diversification et la transition agrocologique ;de conserver et restaurer la biodiversit, tout en promouvant son utilisation durable ;de protger et grer durablement les ressources naturelles indispensables  la vie (l'eau, les sols, l'air) ;de prserver la sant humaine et celle de l'environnement ;et de contribuer  la lutte contre les changements climatiques et leurs impacts dans une double stratgie d'attnuation et d'adaptation Des menaces sur l'alimentation et l'agriculture Le rapport de la FAO sur la biodiversit pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (1) (FAO, 2019) rappelle que cette biodiversit est indispensable a la scurit alimentaire, au dveloppement durable et a la fourniture de nombreux services cosystmiques essentiels pour les populations humaines Dcrypter la biodiversit et comprendre les fonctions qu'elle sous-tend Des dveloppements techniques importants ont t accomplis qui permettent de mieux dcrire la biodiversit (squengage de l'ADN ou de l'ARN, notamment) et les interactions entre especes, ou de faire le lien avec les processus cologiques En plus de caractriser le cortege des micro-organismes associs a chaque h?te, les travaux qui sont mens sur des modles divers permettent d'identifier la nature des fonctions supplmentaires que le microbiote assure au profit de ses porteurs, et d'en comprendre les impacts sur la biologie, l'cologie et le potentiel volutif des h?tes","output":"La recherche agronomique face au virage de la biodiversit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event (1.34 events/million doses; 0.00017% occurrence over 26 years). Several reports of allergic reactions concerning for anaphylaxis have been reported early into the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine campaign in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Objective To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis characterizing the risks of COVID-19 versus vaccine anaphylaxis, comparing universal COVID-19 vaccination vs. risk-stratified vaccination approaches. Methods Cohort analysis models were created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination vs. risk-stratified vaccination (e.g., contraindicated in persons with a history of any prior episode of anaphylaxis) with a threshold for cost-effective care at $10,000,000 per death prevented. In the base case, risk of anaphylaxis was estimated at 0.1% with case-fatality estimated at 0.3%. Results On a population level (n=300,000,000 simulated persons), universal vaccination was associated with a cost-savings of $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives, but the cost-savings was sensitive to increasing rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. The universal strategy dominated at higher rates of COVID-19 infection and low rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis in both the healthcare and societal perspectives. When the risk of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis exceeded 0.8%, the risk-stratified approach to vaccination was the most cost-effective strategy. There was also an interaction between anaphylaxis risk and anaphylaxis fatality, with a risk-stratified approach becoming cost-effective as each risk increased concurrently. Stratified observation time by anaphylaxis history (15 minutes vs 30 minutes) was not cost-effective until a 1% anaphylaxis case-fatality was assumed and risk of vaccine anaphylaxis exceeded 6%. Conclusion This study demonstrates that unless vaccine anaphylaxis rates exceed 0.8% a universal vaccination approach dominates a risk-stratified approach where persons with any history of anaphylaxis would be contraindicated from vaccination, with lower cost and superior health outcomes.","output":"A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Hospitalizations, Fatalities, and Economic Outcomes Associated With Universal Versus Anaphylaxis Risk-Stratified COVID-19 Vaccination Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has attained pandemic status in mere months.

To balance between growth and stress response, plants are equipped with efficient means to switch off the activated stress responses when stresses diminish. We previously revealed such an off-switch mechanism conferred by Arabidopsis PARAQUAT TOLERANCE 3 (AtPQT3) encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, knockout of which significantly enhances resistance to abiotic stresses. To explore whether the rice homolog OsPQT3 is functionally conserved, we generated three knockout mutants with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The OsPQT3 knockout mutants (ospqt3) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1. More importantly, the ospqt3 mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions. We further showed that OsPQT3 expression rapidly decreased in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3 does.

The present study aims to extend our understanding of how illness perceptions, coping, and self-efficacy affect adherence to precautionary measures among the public. An online survey was administered between April and June 2020 to a sample of 514 Hong Kong citizens. Variables considered were illness perceptions toward COVID-19, problem-solving, avoidance-based coping, self-efficacy, as well as adherence to precautionary measures including physical distancing, limiting unnecessary travelling, and washing hands regularly with soap and water. Adjusted structural equation model showed that illness perceptions toward COVID-19 had significant direct effect on their adherence to precautionary measures (unstandardized  = 0.50, [95% CI, 0.28, 0.80], p = 0.001), and indirect effects through avoidance-based coping ( = ?0.10 [95% CI, ?0.26, ?0.01], p = 0.016) and self-efficacy ( = ?0.10, [95% CI, ?0.18, ?0.01], p = 0.025). These results imply that apart from emphasizing the health hazards of a novel infectious disease, an effective public health intervention and crisis communication should address avoidance-based coping and self-efficacy of the public in adherence to precautionary measures for COVID-19.","output":"The Role of Illness Perceptions, Coping, and Self-Efficacy on Adherence to Precautionary Measures for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meteorology and long-term trends in air pollutant concentrations may obscure the results from short-term policies implemented to improve air quality. This study presents changes in CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO2 and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO2 exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O3 increased (p < 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO2 decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p < 0.05) were observed for NO2 (43%), PM10 (20%), and PM2.5 (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O3 concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p < 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO2 decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO2 decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO2 and PM2.5 emissions despite increases in O3, resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O3 within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Quality and Resulting Public Health Benefits in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that affect students behavioral intentions to use virtual classrooms at Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) in Jordan.Design/methodology/approach>A quantitative research approach was adopted, an online survey method was used and the data were collected among students at PSUT in Jordan.

METHODS: Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4(+) T cells from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), active TB and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay and four lncRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based approaches were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by the differentially expressed mRNAs. RESULTS: LncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4(+) T cells were involved in LTBI and active TB disease. Compared with healthy controls, 449 lncRNAs and 461 mRNAs were deregulated in LTBI group, 1,113 lncRNAs and 1,490 mRNAs were deregulated in active TB group, as well as 163 lncRNAs and 187 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both LTBI and active TB group. It was worth noting that 41 lncRNAs and 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups. Most deregulated lncRNAs were from intergenic regions (50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (10%). Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokineCcytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. CONCLUSIONS: The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4(+) T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection.

This pandemic is much more than a health crisis; it has also raised many ethical challenges. The large number of infected patients amid scarce resources has placed healthcare professionals in a critical situation in which they have to make difficult decisions about how to prioritize their patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the ethical challenges experienced and perceived by healthcare professionals working in healthcare institutions and research centers in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted individually with frontline healthcare providers (physicians and nurses), researchers, and decision-makers involved in the management of COVID-19 cases. Each interview lasted up to 90 minutes. The thematic analysis technique was used to analyse the interview data. FINDINGS: The participants rich experiences, which revealed a number of ethical challenges concerning the provision of medical care to infected patients, were framed around four main themes: treatment challenges related to COVID-19 patients, uncertainty of the medical outcome, medical care discrimination, and decision to discontinue medical treatment. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed huge ethical challenges for healthcare professionals that might lead to psychological issues given the emotional toll related to making life-and-death decisions.

Understanding of psychosocial factors related to the use of face coverings within the context of COVID-19 is needed. This study aimed to conceptualize mask-wearing behavior among students using the Multi-theory Model (MTM) of behavior change. Methods: In October 2020, students (n = 595) enrolled in a large public southeastern US university were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional survey, using a valid and reliable instrument. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques described mask-wearing behavior and differentiated theoretical drivers of mask-wearing between individuals compliant and noncompliant with guidelines. Results: Compliant individuals reported significantly higher scores (P &lt; 0.05) for initiation and sustenance of mask-wearing, participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, emotional transformation, practice for change, changes in the social environment, and significantly lower scores for disadvantage. Among multivariable models, all theoretical predictors exhibited significant relationships to their respective outcomes (initiation and sustenance). Specifically, MTM constructs explained approximately 35% of variance in initiation (R-2 = 0.346, F-(3,F-526) = 94.32, P &lt; 0.001) and 33% of variance in sustenance of mask wearing (R-2 = 0.328, F-(3,F-529) = 87.71, P &lt; 0.001) for compliant individuals. Behavioral confidence and emotional transformation exhibited the strongest relationships to initiation (beta = 0.403, P &lt; 0.001) and sustenance (beta = 0.450, P &lt; 0.001), respectively.

This study aims to evaluate incidence, risk factors and case-fatality rate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed the health medical records of 307 consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the University Hospital of Modena, Italy. RESULTS: AKI was diagnosed in 69 out of 307 (22.4%) COVID-19 patients. Stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI accounted for 57.9%, 24.6% and 17.3%, respectively. AKI patients had a mean age of 74.7  9.9 years. These patients showed higher serum levels of the main markers of inflammation and higher rate of severe pneumonia than non-AKI patients. Kidney injury was associated with a higher rate of urinary abnormalities including proteinuria (0.44  0.85 vs 0.18  0.29 mg/mg; P = < 0.0001) and microscopic hematuria (P = 0.032) compared to non-AKI patients. Hemodialysis was performed in 7.2% of the subjects and 33.3% of the survivors did not recover kidney function after AKI. Risk factors for kidney injury were age, male sex, CKD and higher non-renal SOFA score. Patients with AKI had a mortality rate of 56.5%. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that COVID-19-associated AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.82; CI 95%, 1.36C17.08) compared to non-AKI patients. CONCLUSION: AKI was a common and harmful consequence of COVID-19. It manifested with urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, microscopic hematuria) and conferred an increased risk for death. Given the well-known short-term sequelae of AKI, prevention of kidney injury is imperative in this vulnerable cohort of patients.

Covert stroke in the non-surgical setting is much more common than overt stroke and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Little is known about covert stroke after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. METHODS We undertook a prospective, international cohort study to determine the incidence of covert stroke after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. Eligible patients were 65 yr of age and were admitted to hospital for at least three nights after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. Patients underwent a brain magnetic resonance study between postoperative days 3 and 10. The main outcome was the incidence of perioperative covert stroke. RESULTS We enrolled a total of 100 patients from six centres in four countries. The incidence of perioperative covert stroke was 10.0% (10/100 patients, 95% confidence interval 5.5-17.4%). Five of the six centres that enrolled patients reported an incident covert stroke, and covert stroke was found in patients undergoing major general (3/27), major orthopaedic (3/41), major urological or gynaecological (3/22), and low-risk surgery (1/12).

Caries experience was outlined by adapting ICDAS0-6 criteria to the d/D component of the WHO dmf/DMF index configuration. Percentages (%) of caries experience-free children, of children with initial caries (ICDAS1-2), and the mean d1-2t/D1-2T, d3-6mft/D3-6MFT and d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices were calculated. The probability of presenting with d1-2t/D1-2T  1 was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis, whereas negative binomial regression models examined the effect of socio-demographic parameters on d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices (level of significance: p  0.05). RESULTS 60.1%, 48.1%, and 34.7% of the 5, 12, and 15-year-old children, respectively, had no caries experience at the defect level (d3-6mft/D3-6MFT = 0).

Overall, the results obtained with the four assays were similar, with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use. High antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity, assessed using infectious SARS-CoV- 2 or lentiviral-S pseudotypes. In hospitalized patients, seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of COVID cases.

Respiratory tract infection is a common cause of asthma exacerbation. There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID-19 and asthma exacerbation, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. OBJECTIVE: To assess the number for admissions of asthma exacerbation in January to April 2020 in Hong Kong with reference to admission in past five years. METHODS: Admission records of asthma exacerbation were retrieved from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Patients with age at or above 18 years old with known history of asthma admitted for asthma exacerbation were included. Log-linear was used to model count with year and masking used as covariate, with further analysis on ambient temperature, length of hospital stays. Fisher exact test was used to compare the mortality rate and mechanical ventilation between the periods. Admissions for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and gastric ulcer were included as controls. RESULTS: The number of admissions for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased by 53.2% (95%CI 50.4%-55.8%) in 2020 compared with monthly average admission in 2015-2019, with higher magnitude of decrease compared to control diagnoses. Admissions for asthma exacerbation decreased by 2.0% (95%CI 1.8%-2.2%) with every 1a?? (1.8F) increase in temperature and by 0.8% with every 1% increase in masking (95%CI 0.8%-0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization number for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased in early 2020 with similar length of stay. This was observed with concomitant practice of universal masking and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We proposed that universal masking and social distancing reduced respiratory viral infection, leading to less hospital admission with asthma exacerbation.","output":"Territory-wide Study on Hospital Admissions for Asthma exacerbation in COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) required the declaration of a state of emergency in Hungary from 11 March 2020 to 18 June 2020. These governmental actions led to changes in everyday life, implementation of new rules, and reduced access to healthcare. Hospital beds were reserved for emergency use, face-to-face ambulatory care was mainly replaced by telemedicine. In our study we assessed opinion of the patients in two outpatient psychiatric care units in Budapest regarding the state of emergency. METHODS We enrolled 438 patients in the survey (305 women and 133 men, mean age: 51.916.2 years). The patients completed a short questionnaire on a voluntary and anonymous basis following verbal informed consent. The questionnaire was comprised of 10 items and a 12-item \\"Problem Evaluation Scale\\" (fear, isolation and healthcare subscales). The comparison of groups was done using general linear models (GLM), pairwise comparison was performed using Tukey's test for post hoc analysis. The data set was analyzed with SPSS software, version 24.0. RESULTS Up to 34% of enrolled patients believed that their condition worsened during the state of emergency, but 12% of these patients thought that this worsening was not related to the state of emergency. Twice as many patients (12.8%) were concerned about their financial situation than about their health status (6.1%). Loneliness and the implementation of specific regulations didn't cause relevant distress in almost half of the patients, isolation was the most frequently (55.2%) reported difficulty. The worsening of health status was reported more frequently (p=0.001) by the patients younger than 50 years, the sensation of fear was stronger (p=0.045), and they reported more serious adaptation difficulties (p=0.003) than subjects older than 50 years. Isolation caused significantly (p=0.003) more serious distress among women. The abundance of pandemic-related information caused more distress in the case of patients treated for anxiety than participants treated for psychotic disorders (p=0.024). Patients suffering from affective disorders perceived more pronounced feelings of vulnerability compared to patients treated for psychotic disorders (p=0.004). CONCLUSION Approximately half of the enrolled psychiatric patients was able to adapt to this situation without major difficulties, the other half of this sample was more or less distressed by these circumstances. Unfortunately, depletion of emotional, psychological, social and material resources can be expected during the next stage of the pandemic. As a result, we can expect further worsening of the above presented aspects.","output":"[The first lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic from the psychiatric patients' perspective: an ambulatory care client experience survey]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the largest global pandemic in living memory, with between 4.5 and 15M deaths globally from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The influence of therapy for CP on spermatogenesis is well studied. However, recently, especially in the era of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), much attention has been paid to the effects of cytokines on the pathogenesis of the inflammatory process, and their impact on male fertility. AIM To study the effect of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) on ejaculate, MAR test, oxidative stress (OS), and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) in men with infertility and a history of CP. In some patients, the level of cytokines before and after treatment was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 583 infertile men with a history of CP, aged 18-75 years, were screened according to the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. In group I, patients received antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis (triovit, trental, mexidol) in combination with a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) one suppository 25 IU at night for 20 days for 1-3 weeks and for 6-8 weeks for 2 months. In group II, antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis was prescribed along with suppositories for the prevention of CP for 2 months. The evaluated criteria included sperm analysis, MAR test, oxidative stress in spermatozoa (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and SDF. The levels of seminal plasma cytokines were also measured before and after treatment in 32 patients using the Bio-Plex Pro panel for the simultaneous determination of 17 human cytokines, the Human Cytokine 17-plex Assay. Statistica-10 software was used for statistical analysis (p<0.05). RESULTS Of 135 eligible patients, results were collected from 125 men (mean age 31.7 +/- 13.4 years). In group I, there was a more pronounced increase in motility by 42.3%, a decrease in the MAR-test level by 64.7%, oxidative stress in spermatozoa by 56.1%, and SDF by 25.6%, compared to group II (30.4 %, 10.5%, 45.7%, 21.9%), respectively. All these changes were significant with the exception of a decrease in the level of SDF. In group I, there was a predominant increase in the activity of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, 10, 13), a decrease in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines ((IL-2, 12). In group II, there was a significant decrease in both pro-inflammatory (IL-2, 6, 8), and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4). The remaining changes were insignificant. Among mild side effects, there were a change in the color of the sclera in 4 (3.2%), anal pain in 3 (2.4%), a decrease in libido in 2 (1.6%) patients. No differences between groups in the frequency of side effects were recorded (p>0.05). CONCLUSION Antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis in infertile men and CP is an effective and safe. The addition of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) leads to a more profound increase in sperm motility, a decrease in the MAR-test, oxidative stress in sperm cells, which potentiates the effects of therapy. The use of Superlymph is accompanied by a more pronounced positive effect on pathospermia, an increase in anti-inflammatory and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the contrary, in control group, where patients received antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis, only a decrease in the level of main cytokines was observed. The effect of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) on the level of SDF, as well as the relationship with fertility and childbirth rates, requires further study.","output":"[The use of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines for treatment of male infertility and chronic prostatitis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that may progress to cytokine storm syndrome, organ dysfunction, and death.

A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and healthy controls were enrolled. The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma, tracheal aspirate, and lung autopsies tissues from COVID-19 patients, and their neutrophils released higher levels of NETs. Notably, we found that viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce the release of NETs by healthy neutrophils. Mechanistically, NETs triggered by SARS-CoV-2 depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, serine protease, virus replication, and PAD-4. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

P2Y11 is upregulated during differentiation of M2 macrophages, however, it is unclear, whether and how P2Y11 contributes to their anti-inflammatory properties. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Transcriptome and secretome profiling of ectopic P2Y11 was used to obtain clues for P2Y11 signalling and function. Findings were validated in human monocyte-derived M2 macrophages. The suramin analogue NF340 and P2RY11-knockout cells served to confirm that agonist-mediated responses were specific to P2Y11 stimulation. KEY RESULTS Temporal transcriptome profiling of P2Y11 stimulation revealed the signature of a strong and tightly controlled interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) response, including activation of the IL-1R target genes IL6 and IL8. Secretome profiling confirmed the presence of IL-6 and IL-8 proteins and additionally identified soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) as P2Y11 targets. Raising the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in M2 macrophages by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (PDE), especially PDE4, strongly increased the P2Y11 -induced release of sTNFR2 through ectodomain shedding mediated by TNF- converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17). Both, IL-1 and IL-1? synergistically enhanced P2Y11 -induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion as well as release of sTNFR2. During lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which shares the downstream signalling pathway with IL-1R, P2Y11 specifically prevented the secretion of TNF-. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our data indicate that P2Y11 targeting activates IL-1R signalling to promote sTNFR2 release and suppresses TLR4 signalling to prevent TNF- secretion, thus facilitating the resolution of inflammation.","output":"The human G protein-coupled ATP receptor P2Y11 is a target for anti-inflammatory strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic diseases and antibiotic resistance are urgent threats to global health, and human is confronted with an unprecedented dilemma to conquer them by expediting development of new natural product related drugs.

These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. RESULTS: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. CONCLUSION: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios.

There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated. Results: 55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs. Conclusion: These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.","output":"Findings from Cardiovascular Evaluation of NCAA Division I Collegiate Student-Athletes after Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Integrated, data-driven criteria are necessary to evaluate delivery outcomes in pregnancies affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This study provides information on the survivability of PEDV across common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of the liquid antimicrobial. RESULTS: Eighteen ingredients commonly included in commercial swine diets were selected, including 3 grain sources (corn, soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)), 5 porcine by-products (spray-dried plasma, purified plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal and red blood cells (RBCs)), 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) mixes (sow, nursery, finishing), 2 fat sources (choice white grease and soy oil), 3 synthetic amino acids (lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine), as well as limestone and dry choline chloride. Complete feed and stock PEDV served as controls. Thirty grams of each ingredient were inoculated with 2 mL PEDV. A matched set of samples were treated with the formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB? (LA). All samples (n = 320) were stored outdoors under winter time ambient conditions for 30 days. Samples were submitted on 1, 7, 14 and 30 days post-inoculation (DPI) and tested by PCR and virus isolation (VI). All VI-negative samples were tested by swine bioassay. Viable PEDV was detected by VI or swine bioassay at 1, 7, 14 and 30 DPI from SBM, DDGS, meat & bone meal, RBCs, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choice white grease, choline chloride, complete feed and stock virus control and at 7 DPI in limestone and at 14 DPI in threonine. Supplementary testing of complete feed and SBM indicated viable virus out to 45 and 180 DPI, respectively. All other samples were negative by VI and bioassay. In contrast, treatment with LA inactivated PEDV across all ingredients on 1 DPI and induced RNA reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, PEDV viability in feed was influenced by ingredient with extended survival in SBM. Furthermore, LA treatment rendered virus inactive, independent of ingredient type.","output":"An evaluation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus survival in individual feed ingredients in the presence or absence of a liquid antimicrobial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created an enormous burden on global health systems by decreasing health care access and delaying care. Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common surgical emergencies worldwide. Our goal was to determine if patients treated for AA during the pandemic period had more morbidity. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted including patients with AA, from a two-months period in 2020 and a control group from a homologous period in 2019. These groups were compared regarding demographics, surgical findings, surgical and postoperative complications. Results: 68 patients were diagnosed with AA (34 - 2020 and 34 - 2019). In 2020, 2 patients were conservatively treated and 32 underwent surgical appendectomy (2 open surgery - OS and 30 laparoscopic surgery - LPS). In 2019, 1 patient had OS and 33 had LPS. No prior demographic and discharge times were observed. An increase in time until surgery and in number of complications was observed. Conclusion: There were no differences in the total number of AA, however the increased time until surgery can be attributed to the time spent waiting for SARS-CoV test results. The similar discharge time but increased number of complications could be explained by delayed presentation to the emergencies room. ? 2021 Celsius Publishing House.

Public health workers might be at similar risk for negative mental health consequences because of the prolonged demand for responding to the pandemic and for implementing an unprecedented vaccination campaign. The extent of mental health conditions among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is uncertain. A 2014 survey estimated that there were nearly 250,000 state and local public health workers in the United States (4). To evaluate mental health conditions among these workers, a nonprobability-based online survey was conducted during March 29-April 16, 2021, to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation among public health workers in state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments. Among 26,174 respondents, 52.8% reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition in the preceding 2 weeks, including depression (30.8%), anxiety (30.3%), PTSD (36.8%), or suicidal ideation (8.4%). The highest prevalence of symptoms of a mental health condition was among respondents aged 29 years (range = 13.6%-47.4%) and transgender or nonbinary persons (i.e., those who identified as neither male nor female) of all ages (range = 30.4%-65.5%). Public health workers who reported being unable to take time off from work were more likely to report adverse mental health symptoms. Severity of symptoms increased with increasing weekly work hours and percentage of work time dedicated to COVID-19 response activities.

We aimed to explore views of professionals from high-prescribing practices about uptake and implementation of DPs and POC-CRPT to reduce antibiotic use. METHODS: This was a qualitative focus group study in English general practices. The highest antibiotic prescribing practices in the West Midlands were invited to participate. Clinical and non-clinical professionals attended focus groups co-facilitated by two researchers. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Nine practices (50 professionals) participated. Four main themes were identified. Compatibility of strategies with clinical roles and experience C participants viewed the strategies as having limited value as clinical tools, perceiving them as useful only in rare instances of clinical uncertainty and/or for those less experienced. Strategies as social tools C participants perceived the strategies as helpful for negotiating treatment decisions and educating patients, particularly those expecting antibiotics. Ambiguities C participants perceived ambiguities around when they should be used, and about their impact on antibiotic use. Influence of context C various other situational and practical issues were raised with implementing the strategies. CONCLUSIONS: High-prescribing practices do not view DPs and POC-CRPT as sufficiently useful clinical tools in a way which corresponds to the current policy approach advocating their use to reduce clinical uncertainty and improve antimicrobial stewardship. Instead, policy attention should focus on how these strategies may instead be used as social tools to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Attention should also focus on the many ambiguities (concerns and questions) about, and contextual barriers to, using these strategies that need addressing to support wider and more consistent implementation.

Estimates from the CPS, for example, indicate that the number of active business owners dropped by 22 percent from February to April 2020. In this descriptive research note, we provide the first analysis of losses in sales and revenues among the universe of businesses in California using administrative data from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The losses in sales average 17 percent in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019 even though year-over-year sales typically grow by 3-4 percent. We find that sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as Accommodations, which lost 91 percent, whereas online sales grew by 180 percent. Losses also differed substantially across counties with large losses in San Francisco (50 percent) and Los Angeles (24 percent) whereas some counties experienced small gains in sales. Placing business types into different categories based on whether they were essential or non-essential (and thus subject to early lockdowns) and whether they have a moderate or high level of person-to-person contact, we find interesting correlations between sales losses and COVID-19 cases per capita across counties in California. The results suggest that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions and voluntary behavioral responses as reactions to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role, but enforcement of mandatory restrictions may have had a larger impact on sales losses.","output":"Sales Losses in the First Quarter of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from California Administrative Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite lack of convincing evidence of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, it has been suggested to be used for the treatment of SARS CoV 2 to accelerate the negative virus conversion.

We then take a closer look at the main similarities and differences of the model in China, Vietnam and Laos, as well as some main trends in the relationship between the three neighbouring countries. Finally, at the end of the chapter, we identify some themes for further research, with special attention given to the developmental state agenda, political developments and the impact of ongoing changes in international politics.","output":"Making Sense of the Socialist Market Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped and harbor an unusually large (30-32 kb) positive-strand linear RNA genome. Highly pathogenic coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) in humans. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infects mice and serves as an ideal model of viral pathogenesis, mainly because experiments can be conducted using animal-biosafety level-2 (A-BSL2) containment. Human thymosin beta-4 (T?4), a 43-residue peptide with an acetylated N-terminus, is widely expressed in human tissues. T?4 regulates actin polymerization and functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and an antioxidant as well as a promoter of wound healing and angiogenesis. These activities led us to test whether T?4 serves to treat coronavirus infections of humans. To test this possibility, here, we established a BALB/c mouse model of coronavirus infection using mouse CoV MHV-A59 to evaluate the potential protective effect of recombinant human T?4 (rhT?4). Such a system can be employed under A-BSL2 containment instead of A-BSL3 that is required to study coronaviruses infectious for humans. We found that rhT?4 significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-A59 through inhibiting virus replication, balancing the host's immune response, alleviating pathological damage, and promoting repair of the liver. These results will serve as the basis for further application of rhT?4 to the treatment of human CoV diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Recombinant Human Thymosin Beta-4 Protects against Mouse Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS pandemic produces new avenues to discover and anticipate the variations made in SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) and how human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor ideally becomes congenial with \\"S\\" region of this virus and in consequence ofits spread in human species all over the globe At the end of 2019, the earliest wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was notified from Wuhan-Hubei China and thereafter spread globally COVID-19 infection got widespread and upto now, 2,776,224 active cases, 334,058 deceased and 2,078,505-recovered cases have been reported Morbidity and mortality rate vary in every region which pondered the researcher to look into the linkage between a different variant of the SARS-CoV-2 with disease severity along with other determining factors like climatic changes, diagnostic techniques, hospitals and laboratory quality control measures [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Biomedica is the property of Knowledge Bylanes and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Novel Coronavirus (2019-NCOV) Outbreak: A Mini Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a theoretical contribution that draws on the work of Silvia Federici, and particularly her book, Caliban and the Witch: Women, the body and primitive accumulation to discuss crises, struggles over social reproduction, and feminist activist organizing We refer to incidents of women's organizing namely the Parisian petroleuses (the female supporters of the Paris Commune), the Kurdish Women's Movement in Rojava, the Urban Land committees in Venezuela, and the 21st century witch-hunting in Africa, and discuss colonial and patriarchal strategies of exploitation and feminist resistance across different space-times We then suggest that the struggles over social reproduction are intertwined with resistances that enable women to participate in communities that re-embed them in the spheres of feminist activism The article concludes that the crises, including the gendered effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, should be discussed in relation to our capacity to organize in ways that nurture values of cooperation, equality, solidarity, and care, and eliminate unjust access to rights driven by patriarchal and statist repressive modes of social organization (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"The subversive potential of witchcraft: A reflection on federici's self-reproducing movements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of natural selection, the adaxial and abaxial sides of banana leaves show different wetting states and anisotropy. Janus wettability between the adaxial and abaxial sides of the banana leaf surface is revealed for the first time in this work. This has relevance for the preparation of bionic materials and an important role in the efficient and high-quality production management of pesticide spraying in banana orchards. The main purpose of this research is to analyze and study the microscale mechanism and coupling relationship between the Janus wettability of banana leaf surface and the microstructure and micromorphology. We adopt advanced modern instrument analysis technology, such as contact angle (CA) measurements, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray spectrometric analysis (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and performed tests on the adaxial and abaxial sides of banana leaves to investigate the cause of Janus wettability. The results show that banana leaves exhibit different degrees of anisotropy, mainly due to the surface micromorphology. Banana leaves exhibit a hydrophilic Wenzel state on the adaxial side and a weakly hydrophobic Cassie-Baxter state on the abaxial side. We focused on studying the coupling effect and found that the main coupling element impacting the Janus wettability of the banana leaf surface is the nanopillars microstructure, and the secondary coupling element is the content of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface. This work may lead to the design and fabrication of Janus wetting surfaces by mimicking the nanopillar structure on banana leaf surfaces and help explore the potential application of efficient and high-quality pesticide spraying in banana orchards.","output":"Microscale mechanism of microstructure, micromorphology and Janus wettability of the banana leaf surface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To study and learn the role of anti-pneumococcal antibody and the development of vaccines for COVID 19 Materials and Methods: Review of Literature by collecting and retrieving information from a minimum of articles Discussion: The antibody-polysaccharide antigens, such as the pneumococcal vaccine Polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have evolved over the past 20 years, using both unconjugated polysaccharides and polysaccharides conjugated to toxins to elicit a protective immune response in groups at risk for pneumococcal infection Current CDC immunization guidelines for these vaccines have reduced the rates of pneumococcal infections within immunized communities Vaccines against pneumonia, such as a pneumococcal vaccine, do protect against the COVID 19 Conclusion: We acknowledge that the development of pneumococcal vaccine may not protect against the coronavirus More affordable and accessible vaccines for pneumonia are needed to protect from vaccines to kill the coronavirus in one shot As the virus is new and different as it needs its vaccine ?

Outcomes included short-term mortality (in-hospital and 30-days post-discharge) and a composite of major adverse events including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and shock within the index presentation and/or mortality during the index hospitalization or within 30-days post-discharge. RESULTS: Among 367 COVID-19 patients undergoing hs-cTnT, myocardial injury was identified in 46%. They had a higher risk for mortality (20% vs. 12%, P<0.0001; unadjusted HR 4.44, 95% CI 2.13-9.25, P<0.001) and major adverse events (35% vs. 11%, P<0.0001; unadjusted OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.50-7.40, P<0.0001).

Since the current methods for generating transgenic animals result in the random integration of the transgene under study, the phenotype may be compromised due to disruption of known genes or regulatory regions. Unfortunately, most of the tools that predict transgene insertion sites from high-throughput data are not publicly available or not properly maintained. RESULTS: We implemented TC-hunter, Transgene-Construct hunter, an open tool that identifies transgene insertion sites and provides simple reports and visualization aids. It relies on common tools used in the analysis of high-throughput data and makes use of chimeric reads and discordant read pairs to identify and support the transgenic insertion site. To demonstrate its applicability, we applied TC-hunter to four transgenic mice samples harboring the human PPM1D gene, a model used in the study of malignant tumor development. We identified the transgenic insertion site in each sample and experimentally validated them with Touchdown-polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: TC-hunter is an accessible bioinformatics tool that can automatically identify transgene insertion sites from DNA sequencing data with high sensitivity (98%) and precision (92.45%).

SLS III envisioned combination therapy in which the rapid onset and anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone (PFD) would complement the delayed immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory actions of MMF. However, the study design failed to adequately predict the impact from widespread use of MMF by community physicians or FDA approval of nintedanib (9/19) to slow pulmonary function decline in SSc-ILD. SLS III recruitment challenges and adaptive clinical trial modifications are presented. METHODS: SLS III is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial of PFD in SSc-ILD. 150 treatment-naive patients were to be randomized to PFD or placebo, along with initiating MMF, to determine the relative efficacy/safety of combination therapy to MMF alone. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in FVC-% predicted during the 18-month treatment. Three adaptations were implemented: relaxation of screening/entry criteria;expansion of participating clinical sites and enrollment period;and a shift in the target population to include those already receiving MMF. RESULTS: At study initiation (01/18), recruiting eligible treatment-naive patients was already identified as a challenge. The maximum allowed FVC-% at screening (80%) and minimum allowed DLCO-% at baseline (25%) were relaxed 5% to reduce screen failures. The definition of treatmentnaive was broadened to include &lt;3 months of prior MMF without need for a washout. With the release of SENSCIS results (05/20), we increased the number of clinical sites and the recruitment period. However, the rapid adoption of MMF therapy as a community standard forced us to consider patients already on longer treatment with MMF. The time-dependent impact of prior MMF duration on treatment effect was explored using clinical trial simulations to assess study power (Fig 1) and prior MMF exposure stratified into groups (na?ve;&lt;3, &gt;3-6 and &gt;6-9 months). The data identified an acceptable power (0.80) if &lt;50% of enrolled participants had prior MMF use and prior MMF exposure was capped at 6 months (i.e., 3 groups). Unfortunately, the impact from COVID-19 ultimately curtailed site expansion and led to a truncated recruiting period (10/1/2020). 51 participants were randomized (76% naive;14% &lt;3 months MMF;10% &gt;3-6 months MMF).

To inform a clinical trial in people, we investigated vitamin A as a treatment in the context of antibiotic treatment failure in a mouse model of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice exhibited higher systemic bacterial levels with a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate in comparison to mice on a control diet. Sex-specific differences in vitamin A deficiency and disseminated infection with S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) were observed.

The relationship between vaping and contracting COVID-19 is unclear, and information on the internet is conflicting. There is some scientific evidence that vaping cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient in cannabis that is obtained from the hemp plant, or other substances is associated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. However, there is also inaccurate information that vaping can aid COVID-19 treatment, as well as expert opinion that CBD, possibly administered through vaping, can mitigate COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it is necessary to study the spread of inaccurate information to better understand how to promote scientific knowledge and curb inaccurate information, which is critical to the health of vapers. Inaccurate information about vaping and COVID-19 may affect COVID-19 treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using structural topic modeling, we aimed to map temporal trends in the web-based vaping narrative (a large data set comprising web-based vaping chatter from several sources) to indicate how the narrative changed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained data using a textual query that scanned a data pool of approximately 200,000 different domains (4,027,172 documents and 361,100,284 words) such as public internet forums, blogs, and social media, from August 1, 2019, to April 21, 2020. We then used structural topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence and semantic structures within topics around vaping before and after December 31, 2019, when COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: Broadly, the web-based vaping narrative can be organized into the following groups or archetypes: harms from vaping; Vaping Regulation; Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment; and Vaping Lifestyle. Three archetypes were observed prior to the emergence of COVID-19; however, four archetypes were identified postCCOVID-19 (Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment was the additional archetype). A topic related to CBD product preference emerged after COVID-19 was first reported, which may be related to the use of CBD by vapers as a COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is the emergence of a vape-administered CBD treatment narrative around COVID-19 when comparing the web-based vaping narratives before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are key to understanding how vapers respond to inaccurate information about COVID-19, optimizing treatment of vapers who contract COVID-19, and possibly minimizing instances of inaccurate information. The findings have implications for the management of COVID-19 among vapers and the monitoring of web-based content pertinent to tobacco to develop targeted interventions to manage COVID-19 among vapers.","output":"Intersection of the Web-Based Vaping Narrative With COVID-19: Topic Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidneys perform a multitude of essential functions within the human body.

However, the inspiratory right middle lobe volume remained similar in the three positions (all P > 0.15); the expiratory right middle lobe volume was significantly lower in the standing/sitting positions (16.3/14.1% decrease) than in the supine position (both P < 0.0001). The Pearsons correlation coefficients (r) used to compare the total lung volumes on inspiratory CT in the supine/standing/sitting positions and the total lung capacity on PFT were 0.83/0.93/0.95, respectively. The r values comparing the total lung volumes on expiratory CT in the supine/standing/sitting positions and the functional residual capacity on PFT were 0.83/0.85/0.82, respectively. The r values comparing the total lung volume changes from expiration to inspiration on CT in the supine/standing/sitting positions and the inspiratory capacity on PFT were 0.53/0.62/0.65, respectively. The study results could impact preoperative CT volumetry of the lung in lung cancer patients (before lobectomy) for the prediction of postoperative residual pulmonary function, and could be used as the basis for elucidating undetermined pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, in addition to morphological evaluation of the chest, inspiratory and expiratory upright CT may be used as an alternative tool to predict lung volumes such as total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and inspiratory capacity in situation in which PFT cannot be performed such as during an infectious disease pandemic, with relatively more accurate predictability compared with conventional supine CT.","output":"Comparison of inspiratory and expiratory lung and lobe volumes among supine, standing, and sitting positions using conventional and upright CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic the government issued various policies aimed at reducing the human crowd in socializing / social distancing. Even during a pandemic, the government must continue to carry out marriage services because this is a basic right of every citizen. In this case the Director General of Islamic Guidance and Guidance at the Ministry of Religion also gave an appeal to exercise control over marriage services to all Religious Affairs Offices in Indonesia. The Jambi Provincial Regional Office in this case is one of the parties that has participated in carrying out this mandate. This study aims to provide an overview and analyze the implementation of control of the implementation of marriage services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jambi Province. The method used in this research is descriptive analysis with a qualitative approach in analyzing the implementation of marriage service control policies at the Regional Office of the Ministry of Religion of Jambi Province. Based on the results of the study in general there was a decrease in the number of marriages in Jambi Province during the COVID-19 pandemic. As for the results of the interview the Regional Office has carried out various strategies such as being strict with the rules, working with relevant stakeholders and communicating intensely about health protocols. In addition, there are obstacles both from the negligence of the prospective bride and groom and the culture of the people themselves which tend to create a cluster.

PVP at different concentrations were used to treat different groups of fibroblasts from TAO patients and normal persons. Dexamethasone (Dex) was used as a positive control drug, and interferon-?3 (IFN-?3) was used as a positive stimulant. The effects of PVP on the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts, the secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA), the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) and apoptosis in orbital fibroblasts were determined. The experimental results showed when the concentration of PVP was greater than 400 g/mL, it could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO (P < 0.05). However, no definite inhibitory effect was observed in the orbital fibroblasts from the normal people. Dex could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people (P < 0.05). In contrast, every concentration of IFN-?3 could promote the orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people proliferation. No groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on HA secretion by orbital fibroblasts from normal people (P > 0.05). But the Dex group, IFN-?3+PVP-1600 group and IFN-?3+Dex group could significantly inhibit the secretion of HA from orbital fibroblasts of TAO patients. And there were no groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on the expression of ICAM-1/CD54 in orbital fibroblasts from TAO patients (P > 0.05). PVP and Dex at all concentrations could significantly promote orbital fibroblast co-cultured with IFN-?3 apoptosis (P < 0.05). But without IFN-?3, PVP and Dex at all concentrations could only significantly promote orbital fibroblast from TAO patients apoptosis (P < 0.05). These results suggest that PVP exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts and promoting the apoptosis of orbital fibroblasts in TAO patients. In addition, in this process, HA secretion is suppressed. But the participation of IFN-?3 is required. This effect is similar to that of Dex. And in the MTT experiment, the efficacy of PVP showed selectivity for TAO patients. This is different from Dex. This may be a feature of PVP that deserves attention.","output":"Effect of Prunella vulgaris polysaccharides on cultured orbit fibroblasts in vitro from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To report the 30-day outcomes of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery in the USA. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty regarding the postoperative risks of patients with SARS-CoV-2 exists. METHODS: As part of the COVIDSurg multicenter study, all patients aged 17 years undergoing surgery between January 1 and June 30, 2020 with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70 hospitals across 27 states were included. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and pulmonary complications. Multivariable analyses (adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and procedure characteristics) were performed to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1581 patients were included; more than half of them were males (n = 822, 52.0%) and older than 50 years (n = 835, 52.8%). Most procedures (n = 1261, 79.8%) were emergent, and laparotomies (n = 538, 34.1%). The mortality and pulmonary complication rates were 11.0 and 39.5%, respectively. Independent predictors of mortality included age 70 years (odds ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval [1.65C3.69]), male sex (2.26 [1.53C3.35]), ASA grades 3C5 (3.08 [1.60C5.95]), emergent surgery (2.44 [1.31C4.54]), malignancy (2.97 [1.58C5.57]), respiratory comorbidities (2.08 [1.30C3.32]), and higher Revised Cardiac Risk Index (1.20 [1.02C1.41]). While statewide elective cancelation orders were not associated with a lower mortality, a sub-analysis showed it to be associated with lower mortality in those who underwent elective surgery (0.14 [0.03C0.61]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection have a significantly high risk for postoperative complications, especially elderly males. Postponing elective surgery and adopting non-operative management, when reasonable, should be considered in the USA during the pandemic peaks.","output":"Outcomes and Their State-level Variation in Patients Undergoing Surgery With Perioperative SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the USA: A Prospective Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Framed within a society insidiously damaged by the novel coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions, this article examines the drum and bass on the bike initiative of British DJ Dom Whiting.

This posed unique challenges for the teaching of anatomy, which is a practical subject area. This study compares the cognitive load (CL) experienced by first-and second-year veterinary anatomy students studying in 2019 (before COVID-19 teaching adjustments) and 2020 (during COVID-19 teaching adjustments). Importantly, the core teaching content remained identical for both subjects in 2019 and 2020, allowing us to isolate the effects of differences in instructional delivery. Materials and Methods: CL was measured among first-(n2019 = 105, n2020 = 49) and second-year students (n2019 = 85, n2020 = 42) at the end of each teaching semester, using a previously validated survey. The survey measures CL, broken down into intrinsic load (IL, complexity of the material being studied), extraneous load (EL, way material is presented), and germane load (GL, self-perceived learning). T-test compared the low (2019) and high (2020) blended learning cohorts in terms of CL. Results: T-tests indicated that the 2019 and 2020 cohorts did not differ on IL or EL in either the first-or second-year subject. However, among both first-and second-year students, the 2020 cohort reported significantly less GL as compared to the 2019 cohort. Conclusion: Students who experienced intensified blended learning did not differ from pre-COVID-19 students with respect to perceptions of the difficulty of learning anatomy due to anatomy's inherent complexity or the way learning materials are presented. However, these students were significantly less likely to feel that course activities enhanced their understanding of anatomy.

This occurrence has been rarely reported in the literature and described only in very few case reports. During the surge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in our region, we noted an increase in the simultaneous occurrence of cardio-cerebral infarction. This led us to explore the possible mechanisms and pathophysiology that could contribute to this increase. The retrospective nature of the study limited us from drawing any conclusion about causation. Rather, we aimed to formulate a hypothesis for future, more rigorous studies. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present an overview of 5 cases of simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction that we encountered in our emergency department within 1 month. DIAGNOSIS: In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed using an electrocardiogram, assessment of laboratory cardiac markers, and imaging. INTERVENTIONS: In all cases, dual antiplatelet therapy was started and thrombolysis was held, as the condition was considered high risk in most of the patients. Cardiac catheterization lab was not activated either because the patient was unstable or the risk of COVID-19 in staff outweighed the benefit added in patient treatment. OUTCOMES: Two out of 5 patients died because of early complications that lasted for few days. The remaining 3 were discharged from the hospital in moderate functionality for extensive therapy and rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Early recognition and immediate treatment is important in different scenarios leading to thrombosis as the outcome. Additionally, addressing the unknown risks that could contribute to our traditional understanding of these causative mechanisms is important. The hypothesis of exacerbated damage caused by inflammatory and immunological endothelial systemic damage should further be explored to be able to delineate new possibilities in managing these conditions.","output":"Simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction in the coronavirus disease pandemic era: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In the semirecumbent position, gravity-dependent dissemination of pathogens has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia. We compared the preventive effects of a ventilatory strategy, aimed at decreasing pulmonary aspiration and enhancing mucus clearance versus the Trendelenburg position. DESIGN Prospective randomized animal study. SETTING Animal research facility, University of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS Twenty-four Large White-Landrace pigs. INTERVENTIONS Pigs were intubated and on mechanical ventilation for 72 hours. Following surgical preparation, pigs were randomized to be positioned: 1) in semirecumbent/prone position, ventilated with a duty cycle (TITTOT) of 0.33 and without positive end-expiratory pressure (control); 2) as in the control group, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O and TITTOT to achieve a mean expiratory-inspiratory flow bias of 10 L/min (treatment); 3) in Trendelenburg/prone position and ventilated as in the control group (Trendelenburg). Following randomization, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was instilled into the oropharynx. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mucus clearance rate was measured through fluoroscopic tracking of tracheal markers. Microspheres were instilled into the subglottic trachea to assess pulmonary aspiration. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed by histological/microbiological studies. The mean expiratory-inspiratory flow in the treatment, control, and Trendelenburg groups were 10.7  1.7, 1.8  3.7 and 4.3  2.8 L/min, respectively (p < 0.001). Mucus clearance rate was 11.3  9.9 mm/min in the Trendelenburg group versus 0.1  1.0 in the control and 0.2  1.0 in the treatment groups (p = 0.002).

However, due to the resource-consuming nature of following a cohort prospectively, life expectancy is often assessed based upon retrospective death record reviews. This conventional approach may lead to potentially biased estimates, in particular when estimating life expectancy of rare diseases such as Morquio syndrome A. We investigated the accuracy of life expectancy estimation using death records by simulating the survival of individuals with Morquio syndrome A under four different scenarios. RESULTS: When life expectancy was constant during the entire period, using death data did not result in a biased estimate. However, when life expectancy increased over time, as is often expected to be the case in rare diseases, using only death data led to a substantial underestimation of life expectancy. We emphasize that it is therefore crucial to understand how estimates of life expectancy are obtained, to interpret them in an appropriate context, and to assess estimation methods within a sensitivity analysis framework, similar to the simulations performed herein.

Latent profile and latent transition analyses were used to identify latent quality of life (QoL) classes and multiform changes, their probabilities, and predictors. RESULTS: We identified five distinct QoL classes of varying proportions, namely Flourishing (i.e. 24C40%), Content (31C46%), Content-Symptomatic (8C10%), Languishing (14C20%), and Troubled (2C5%). Despite higher levels of negative affect and lower levels of life satisfaction and positive emotions, most individuals remained in their pre-pandemic QoL profiles. Yet, changes occurred for a meaningful proportion, with transition to a less favourable class more common than to a favourable.

Modern constitutions, including the Russian and the Belarusian ones, contains the most important principles of the rule of law, enshrine human rights and freedoms as the highest value. Human rights and freedoms continue to be are at the epicenter of many disputes and discussions. The modern system of rights and freedoms is constantly developing;the legal status of a person receives new content as the human civilization develops and the paradigm of values changes. For example, we see how information technology and other advances affect the scope of rights and freedoms. Rights, freedoms and obligations are interconnected and interdependent. All groups of rights are currently in the field of view of international organizations. The problem of equality, the elimination of discrimination, the restoration of violated rights, the assessment of the limits of the state's invasion in human rights and freedoms continues to be relevant nowadays. The article focuses on the international and national standards for the possible restriction of rights and freedoms in order to protect the health of the population. The international law rules on human rights oblige states to take measures to protect health and provide medical assistance to those in need. Conclusions. One of the constant problems is the relationship between the rights of a particular person and the rights of other persons, group or society as a whole and the state. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic forced the public authorities to determine the balance of the priority of human rights and freedoms or the protection of the life and health of citizens. The coronavirus pandemic is the factor that affects the content of the legal regulation of relations in the field of human rights and freedoms. The measures taken by the state affect the right to health protection, freedom of movement, the right to education, right to have sport activity, right to work, freedom of assembly and others. The article proposes to inform the population more fully about the measures taken by the state and society in this direction, about the wider use of information technologies, about the possible responsibility for non-compliance with the requirements for the use of personal protective equipment and the self-isolation regime.","output":"Coronavirus Pandemic as a Reason for Limitation of Human Rights and Freedoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few decades, computational methods have been developed to estimate perceptual audio quality. These methods, also referred to as objective quality measures, are usually developed and intended for a specific application domain. Because of their convenience, they are often used outside their original intended domain, even if it is unclear whether they provide reliable quality estimates in this case. This work studies the correlation of well-known state-of-the-art objective measures with human perceptual scores in two different domains: audio coding and source separation. The following objective measures are considered: fwSNRseg, dLLR, PESQ, PEAQ, POLQA, PEMO-Q, ViSQOLAudio, (SI-)BSSEval, PEASS, LKR-PI, 2f-model, and HAAQI. Additionally, a novel measure (SI-SA2f) is presented, based on the 2f-model and a BSSEval-based signal decomposition. We use perceptual scores from 7 listening tests about audio coding and 7 listening tests about source separation as ground-truth data for the correlation analysis. The results show that one method (2f-model) performs significantly better than the others on both domains and indicate that the dataset for training the method and a robust underlying auditory model are crucial factors towards a universal, domain-independent objective measure.","output":"Objective Measures of Perceptual Audio Quality Reviewed: An Evaluation of Their Application Domain Dependence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives of the study were to examine the virtual screening of the compounds and sigma-covalent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerase), which is conserved and is an essential enzyme for RNA transcription and replication of this virus.

The individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) app aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touchscreen technology. The iCST app has been developed according to the principles of CST and iCST, which have previously shown to improve the cognition and quality of life of people with dementia and benefit the relationship between the person with dementia and his/her carer. The iCST app has also shown to improve the quality of the carers life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of the iCST app intervention and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app intervention compared to that of treatment-as-usual for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. METHODS: We aim to recruit 60 people with mild-to-moderate dementia and their informal carers as dyads in a multi-center feasibility RCT with a treatment-as-usual control group. Both parties must be able to provide informed consent and participate in the intervention. Dyads will complete a baseline assessment that will include cognition and quality of life measures and they will subsequently be randomized (1:1) to the iCST app intervention in addition to usual care or to usual care only. All participants will be followed up at 5 weeks and at 11 weeks after the baseline assessments. A range of feasibility outcomes will be assessed, including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome measures. A sample of the experimental group will be invited to a semistructured posttrial interview to further examine the experience of using the iCST app. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2015 and obtained ethical approval in March 2018. Data collection began in November 2018 and was completed in March 2020 with a total of 61 dyads recruited. Data analyses are in progress and the final results are expected to be available in the spring of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a full-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app in comparison to that of usual care alone. In addition, this study will examine the usability of the iCST app. The data will provide information on potential modifications to be made to the intervention, study design, and study process.

In this paper, we analyze web traffic data from The Gateway Pundit (TGP), a popular far-right website that is known for repeatedly sharing false information that has made its web traffic available to the general public. We collect data on 68 million web traffic visits to the site over a month period and analyze how people consume news via multiple features. Our traffic analysis shows that search engines and social media platforms are main drivers of traffic; our geo-location analysis reveals that TGP is more popular in counties that voted for Trump in 2020; and our topic analysis shows that conspiratorial articles receive more visits than factual articles. Due to the inability to observe direct website traffic, existing research uses alternative data source such as engagement signals from social media posts. To validate if social media engagement signals correlate with actual web visit counts, we collect all Facebook and Twitter posts with URLs from TGP during the same time period. We show that all engagement signals positively correlate with web visit counts, but with varying correlation strengths. Metrics based on Facebook posts correlate better than metrics based on Twitter.

METHODS Between October 2019 and January 2021, a total of 15 consecutive patients (age 81.0 [78.1, 84.4] years; 53.3% female; EuroSCORE II 10.6 [6.3, 14.8] %) underwent BASILICA procedure prior to TAVI at our institution. Indications for TAVI were degeneration of stented (n = 12, 80.0%) or stentless (n = 1, 6.7%) bioprosthetic aortic valves, or calcific stenosis of native aortic valves (n = 2, 13.3%), respectively. Individual risk of TAVI-induced coronary obstruction was assessed by pre-procedural computed tomography analysis. Procedural and 30-day outcomes were documented in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria. RESULTS BASILICA was attempted for single left coronary cusp in 12 patients (80.0%), for single right coronary cusp in 2 patients (13.3%), and for both cusps in 1 patient (6.7%), respectively. The procedure was feasible in 13 patients (86.7%) resulting in effective prevention of coronary obstruction, whilst TAVI was performed without prior successful bioprosthetic leaflet laceration in two patients (13.3%). In one of these patients (6.7%), additional chimney stenting immediately after TAVI was performed. No all-cause deaths or strokes were documented after 30 days. CONCLUSION The BASILICA technique appears to be a feasible, safe and effective concept to avoid iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction during TAVI in both native and bioprosthetic valves of patients at high or prohibitive risk.

To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy.

In Malaysia, the government implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) as a preventive measure against Covid-19. In education, the learning process has been transferred to online teaching. However, pandemic pedagogy is making learning into completely online either synchronous or asynchronous. Therefore, the current research aims to determine the secondary school teachers psychological status, competencies in e-teaching and teachers work motivation as well as determine the relationship between secondary school teachers psychological status and competencies in e-teaching during the Covid-19 outbreak. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Current research is a descriptive-correlational quantitative survey to determine teachers psychological status, e-teaching competencies and working motivation during Movement Control Order (MCO) to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. The study sample consists of 595 secondary school teachers selected via convenient sampling. Quantitative data are collected from an online survey through the questionnaires with demographic, psychological status (stress, anxiety and depression), e-teaching competencies (teaching, monitoring and evaluation) and teaching motivation developed by the researchers were distributed during the MCO period. SPSS 25 is applied, Statistical measures such as Cronbach's alpha, means, percentage and standard deviation were employed to analyze the data to obtain the value of the school teachers psychological status, e-teaching competencies and teaching motivation. Consequently, a Pearson correlation table was created to show the analysis of the school teachers psychological status and competencies in e-teaching. FINDINGS: This finding indicated that the teachers psychological factors in stress, anxiety and depressed are moderate, the teachers competencies in e-teaching is moderate as well as teachers working motivations is also the moderate level. However, the highest mean value was found among the variables, this is revealed that despite the challenges during the Covid-19 outbreak, teachers showed positive and strong motivation in conducting e-teaching. Additionally, the result showed a negative relationship between psychological status and e-teaching competencies (-0.286, p<0.01), as well as reported a negative relationship between dimension of psychological status and competencies in e-teaching.

Depending on the severity of lockdown policies, the consumption pattern has changed even at different stages of the epidemic. Forecasting gasoline demand has become a more difficult and essential tool for energy planning. Therefore, reliable models are needed to ensure energy security in pandemic conditions. Presenting a case study on Turkey, this paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gasoline demand. Four common machine learning models, including Gaussian Process Regression, Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor, and Random Forest, were used to estimate daily gasoline consumption. In the training of the models, inputs such as historical gasoline demand, national holidays, date attributes, gasoline price, and COVID-19 related factors such as curfews and travel bans were considered. Analysis results showed that the Random Forest model performed best with the highest correlation coefficient (0.959) and the lowest mean absolute percentage error (11.526%), and root mean square percentage error (17.022%) values in the test dataset.

DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of programmatic data obtained from a non-governmental organisation. SETTING: Two faith-based, secondary-level hospitals located in rural communities in southern Madagascar. PARTICIPANTS: All women using maternal healthcare services at the study hospitals between 1 March 2019 and 7 September 2020 were included (n=957 women). MEASURES: We collected patient invoices and medical records of all participants. We then calculated the rate of catastrophic health expenditure relative to 10% and 25% of average annual household consumption in the study region. RESULTS: Overall, we found a high rate of catastrophic health expenditure (10% threshold: 486/890, 54.6%; 25% threshold: 366/890, 41.1%). Almost all women who required surgical care, most commonly a caesarean section, incurred catastrophic health expenditure (10% threshold: 279/280, 99.6%; 25% threshold: 279/280, 99.6%). The rate of catastrophic health expenditure among women delivering spontaneously was 5.7% (14/247; 10% threshold). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that direct patient costs of managing pregnancy and birth-related complications at faith-based hospitals are likely to cause catastrophic health expenditure. Financial risk protection strategies for reducing out-of-pocket payments for maternal healthcare should include faith-based hospitals to improve health-seeking behaviour and ultimately achieve universal health coverage in Madagascar.","output":"Direct patient costs of maternal care and birth-related complications at faith-based hospitals in Madagascar: a secondary analysis of programme data using patient invoices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) are a significant workforce in primary care and are uniquely positioned to improve oral health in children through ongoing surveillance in the well-child visit.

Indeed, the pandemic has had a considerable impact on the delivery of medical education in the UK for both pre-clinical and clinical year students. In response to the escalating case fatality rate due to the pandemic, there has been widespread termination of clinical placements, face-to-face teaching sessions, and examinations that require a physical presence by UK medical schools. It is hoped that the cancellation of the aforementioned activities will greatly reduce the exposure of medical students to the coronavirus however, the consequences of these actions may pose substantial issues for the learning experience and professional development of medical students. One such issue is the lack of regular communication between students and personal tutors which may give rise to burnout within students and impede academic performance. Furthermore, the suspension of clinical placements may result in a gradual reduction in students clinical skills competence. The practice of medicine is grounded upon the application of basic science which involves undertaking clinical procedures and as such, students may be at a disadvantage due to the missed opportunity to refine these essential skills. In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education, specifically regarding curriculum delivery and assessment of students. We also adopt a holistic approach by considering the impact of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of medical students during this unprecedented time. We offer pragmatic suggestions to uphold the quality of medical education such as the implementation of virtual interprofessional education sessions to solve clinical vignettes and virtual consultation skills with simulated patients. We conclude with suggested areas for future research to examine the effectiveness of a virtual interprofessional education model on both short and long-term learning as well as encouraging medical students and academic staff to trial innovative methods of teaching. Despite the resultant complications of the pandemic on medical education, these challenging times may present a serendipitous opportunity for medical students to cultivate the personal attributes expected of a doctor in the face of adversity. In light of the pandemic, there is scope to reconsider the effectiveness of current medical education and welcome innovative methods of delivering education whilst ensuring quality.

Unexpectedly, a tetra-silver center was found in the active-site pocket of MCR-1 as revealed by the X-ray structure of the Ag-bound MCR-1, resulting in the prevention of substrate binding. Moreover, Ag(+) effectively slows down the development of higher-level resistance and reduces mutation frequency. Importantly, the combined use of Ag(+) at a low concentration with colistin could relieve dermonecrotic lesions and reduce the bacterial load of mice infected with mcr-1Ccarrying pathogens.

Exposure to IBRV and M. bovis was infrequent, and although exposure to PIV-3 was more common, none of these agents had important associations with BRD. Higher titers to BVDV, BRSV, and BCV on arrival were associated with reduced risks of BRD and increased weight gains. However, there was some variation in these relationships and higher arrival titers to BVDV and BRSV in a subset of the calves were associated with increased risks of BRD. Titer increases to BVDV were associated with a higher risk of BRD and lower weight gains. Titer increases to BRSV were not usually associated with the occurrence of BRD, but titer increases to BRSV in a subset of calves that were vaccinated against BRSV, on arrival, were associated with an elevated risk of BRD. Of all the agents studied, BVDV had the most consistent associations with elevated risk of BRD and lower weight gains. Higher BRSV arrival titers were related to lower risk of BRD and higher weight gains; in some instances titer increases to BRSV were associated with higher BRD risk. Higher titers to BCV on arrival were related to reduced risks of BRD.

Clinicians should be aware of the VTE risk in patients with COVID-19, many of whom present with severe coagulation disorders. Method: We used an online platform to conduct a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among doctors in mainland China in March 2020. The questionnaire was designed to figure out the clinician's current awareness of VTE prevention and detection rates, as well as the current status of VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19. Results: We collected 1,636 replies, of which 1,579 were valid. Among these, 991 (63%) clinicians were involved directly in frontline treatment. Most of the clinicians (1,492, or 94%) thought it was necessary to assess the VTE risk in patients with COVID-19. However, only 234 (24%) clinicians performed appropriate assessment during the COVID-19 outbreak. For patients with mild/moderate COVID-19, 752 (76%) clinicians would prescribe exercise and water to prevent VTE. For patients with severe COVID-19, 448 (45%) clinicians would prescribe mechanical devices if the patient had a high bleeding risk, and 648 (65%) clinicians would choose LMWH as prophylaxis if the patient had a low bleeding risk. The VTE detection rate was not that high in both mild/moderate and severe patients. Conclusion: Although most clinicians recommended prescribing VTE prophylaxis to patients with COVID-19, the practice still needs to be improved. A real-world registry to investigate the true incidence of VTE, and the effect of prescribing appropriate prophylaxis for patients with COVID-19, is necessary in the future.","output":"Awareness and Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with COVID-19: A National Cross-Sectional Survey in Epidemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools quickly transitioned their teaching and assessment strategies to online formats.

Whether inflammasome expression in intestinal tissue reflects the serum inflammatory protein profile of patients is also not known. We aimed to determine the intestinal cell types where inflammasome expression is increased in CD and if they correlate with the serum protein profile. RT-PCR and NanoString nCounter technology were used to characterize inflammasome gene expression in CD patients and controls. The mucosa, LP and IEC cell fractions and FACS-sorted cells were analyzed. Proximity extension assay with a 92-protein panel was used to determine the serum inflammatory protein profile. Compositional analysis was used to correlate ileum inflammasome gene expression with intestinal mononuclear phagocyte populations. We show that NLRP3 and MEFV inflammasome sensors and downstream effector expression including IL-1 are increased in inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and correlate with disease activity. Inflammasome gene expression increased with the abundance of immature intestinal macrophages, and increased IL-1 released by CD LP cells correlated with immature macrophage frequency. Inflammasome gene expression was also increased in circulating monocytes, the precursors of immature intestinal macrophages. Finally, the serum inflammatory profile of CD patients correlates with ileal expression of genes related to NLRP3 and MEFV inflammasomes. Overall, we show that MEFV and NLRP3 inflammasome expression in CD intestine is attributed to the accumulation of immature macrophages and correlates with serum inflammatory proteins.

DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an implementation research using participatory action process and existing resources from the Duke Antimicrobial Stewardship Outreach Network with local adjustments. A national stakeholder meeting and Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis were conducted to identify gaps and potential interventions. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital AMS staff implemented activities throughout the study phases. Routinely collected patient data were analysed to support planning, implementation and evaluation. INTERVENTIONS: Hospitals were considered as a complex adaptive system and leveraged their unique characteristics and interconnections to develop 1-year plans containing core interventions (data use, educational training, prospective audit with feedback (PAF) and evaluations). OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed feasibility using outputs from stakeholder meeting, SWOT analysis, baseline data, planning process and implementation. RESULTS: The stakeholder meeting identified three gaps for AMS at national level: supportive policies, AMS training and core competencies and collaboration. At the hospitals, AMS programmes took 1 year for planning due to lack of hospital-specific procedures and relevant staff competencies. Baseline data (JanuaryCDecember 2019) showed variations in antibiotic consumption: 951 days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 days present in the control and 496 in the intervention wards in hospital 1, and 737 and 714 in hospital 2, respectively. During 1-year implementation, clinical pharmacists audited 1890 antibiotic prescriptions in hospital 1 (June 2020CMay 2021) and 1628 in hospital 2 (July 2020CJuly 2021), and will continue PAF in their daily work. CONCLUSION: Our data confirmed the need to contextualise AMS programmes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and demonstrated the usefulness of implementation research design in assessing programme feasibility. Developing staff competencies, using local data to stimulate actions and integrating programme activities in routine hospital work are key to success in LMICs.","output":"Assessing feasibility of establishing antimicrobial stewardship programmes in two provincial-level hospitals in Vietnam: an implementation research study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing concern about the mental health sequelae to the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a surge in research and publications on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in general population samples in relation to the pandemic.

We propose a method based on binary expert networks that enhances the explainability of image classifications through better localization by mitigating the model uncertainty induced by class overlap. Our technique performs discriminative localization on images that contain features with significant class overlap, without explicitly training for localization.

When severe, it can lead to many common ear disorders such as otitis media with effusion, tympanic membrane retraction/perforation, and cholesteatoma. These diseases are prevalent in both the pediatric and adult population and significantly impact quality of life. The pathophysiology of ETD in the absence of an obstructive lesion has long been debated but is thought to be related to functional obstruction (i.e., inefficient tensor veli palatini muscle) and/or nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal inflammation. In the acute setting, the most common cause of nasal inflammation is an upper respiratory infection. When symptoms become chronic, however, the inflammation is thought to be associated with nasal irritants such as nasal allergens, i.e., allergic rhinitis (AR). The purpose of this review is to summarize our current understanding of the relationship between allergy and ETD. RECENT FINDINGS: Past studies are either lacking or have reported equivocal findings regarding the relationship between allergy and ETD, and the 2018 International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis has deemed the current level of evidence linking AR and ETD as low quality. A more recent study using a large adult population dataset did support an association between AR and ETD, but did not find that all cases of ETD are related to allergies. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that the use of medications that can decrease intranasal inflammation, such as intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines, does not result in significant symptomatic improvement in patients with ETD. However, these studies included all patients with ETD, and evidence is lacking regarding the treatment effect of these medications on the subset of patients with concurrent AR and ETD. Current best evidence does support an association between AR and ETD; however, not all patients with ETD suffer from AR, and vice versa.

As the ongoing COVID-19 crisis worsens in countries having dense populations and inadequate testing kits like Brazil and India, radiological imaging can act as an important diagnostic tool to accurately classify covid-19 patients and prescribe the necessary treatment in due time. With this motivation, we present our study based on deep learning architecture for detecting covid-19 infected lungs using chest X-rays. Dataset: We collected a total of 2470 images for three different class labels, namely, healthy lungs, ordinary pneumonia, and covid-19 infected pneumonia, out of which 470 X-ray images belong to the covid-19 category. Methods: We first pre-process all the images using histogram equalization techniques and segment them using U-net architecture. VGG-16 network is then used for feature extraction from the pre-processed images which is further sampled by SMOTE oversampling technique to achieve a balanced dataset. Finally, the class-balanced features are classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with 10-fold cross-validation and the accuracy is evaluated. Result and Conclusion: Our novel approach combining well-known pre-processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and dataset balancing method, lead us to an outstanding rate of recognition of 98% for COVID-19 images over a dataset of 2470 X-ray images. Our model is therefore fit to be utilized in healthcare facilities for screening purposes.","output":"Classification of COVID-19 on chest X-Ray images using Deep Learning model with Histogram Equalization and Lungs Segmentation (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of respirator extended use and reuse strategies with regard to cost and sustainability during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cost analysis. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: All healthcare workers within the USA. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A model was developed to estimate usage, costs and waste incurred by several respirator usage strategies over the first 6 months of the pandemic in the USA. This model assumed universal masking of all healthcare workers. Estimates were taken from the literature, government databases and commercially available data from approved vendors. RESULTS: A new N95 respirator per patient encounter would require 7.41 billion respirators, cost $6.38 billion and generate 84.0 million kg of waste in the USA over 6 months. One respirator per day per healthcare worker would require 3.29 billion respirators, cost $2.83 billion and generate 37.22 million kg of waste. Decontamination by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation would require 1.64 billion respirators, cost $1.41 billion and accumulate 18.61 million kg of waste. H(2)O(2) vapour decontamination would require 1.15 billion respirators, cost $1.65 billion and produce 13.03 million kg of waste. One reusable respirator with daily disposable filters would require 18 million respirators, cost $1.24 billion and generate 15.73 million kg of waste. Pairing a reusable respirator with H(2)O(2) vapour-decontaminated filters would reduce cost to $831 million and generate 1.58 million kg of waste. The use of one surgical mask per healthcare worker per day would require 3.29 billion masks, cost $460 million and generate 27.92 million kg of waste. CONCLUSIONS: Decontamination and reusable respirator-based strategies decreased the number of respirators used, costs and waste generated compared with single-use or daily extended-use of disposable respirators. Future development of low-cost, simple technologies to enable respirator and/or filter decontamination is needed to further minimise the economic and environmental costs of masks.","output":"Thinking green: modelling respirator reuse strategies to reduce cost and waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While catalytic electron flow and photoreactivation of CPD-photolyases are increasingly understood, the microscopic details of the 64-photolyase repair mechanism are perpetually debated. Here, we investigate in long-time (s) molecular dynamics simulations combined with extensive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations the primary electron transfer (ET) reactions in 64-photolyase of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). The characterization of the relative energetics of locally excited and charge separated states in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex reveals a charge-separated state involving the adenine moiety of the FADH- cofactor that facilitates reduction of the photoproduct. Microscopic details of the collective reaction coordinate of ET reactions are identified that involve the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network and structural relaxation of the active site. The simulations reveal complex active site relaxation dynamics involving distinguished amino acids (Lys246, His365, and His369), conformational reorganization of the hydroxyl group of the (6-4) photoproduct, and a strengthening of hydrogen bonds with immobilized water molecules. In particular, rotation of the Lys246 side chain is found to impose a double-well character along the reaction coordinate of the ET reaction. Our findings suggest that the primary ET reactions in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex of D. melanogaster are governed by a complex multi-minima active site relaxation dynamics and potentially precede the equilibration of the protein. ET pathways mediated by the adenine moiety and the 5' side of the photoproduct are proposed to be relevant for triggering the catalytic (6-4) photoproduct reactivation.","output":"Electron Transfer-Induced Active Site Structural Relaxation in 64-Photolyase of Drosophila melanogaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinics use scheduling systems for patients appointments. However, no-shows are frequent in both general medical practices and specialties, and they can be quite costly and disruptive. This problem has become more severe because of COVID-19. The primary purpose of this study is to develop machine learning algorithms to predict if patients will keep their next appointment, which would help with rescheduling appointments. The main objective in addressing the no-show problem is to reduce the false negative rate (i.e., Type II error). That occurs when the model incorrectly predicts that the patients will show up for an appointment, but they do not. Moreover, the dataset encounters an imbalance issue, and this paper addresses that issue with a new and effective hybrid sampling method: ALL K-NN and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) yield a 0% false negative rate through machine learning models. This paper also investigates the leading factors that affect the no-show rates for different specialties. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method reveals several patterns to identify the target feature (patient no-shows). It determined that a patients history of missed appointments was one of the leading indicators. It was also found that greater lead times between booking the appointment and the appointment date were associated with more no-show behavior. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Mining and Predicting No-Show Medical Appointments: Using Hybrid Sampling Technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy makers often make decisions based on parameters such as GDP, unemployment rate, industrial output, etc. The primary methods to obtain or even estimate such information are resource intensive and time consuming.

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of COPD patients among the population with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with positive PCR test were included in our multicentered, retrospective study. Patients with airway obstruction (previous spirometry) were included in COPD group. RESULTS: The prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was 4.96%(53/1069). There was a significant difference between COPD and non-COPD COVID-19 patients in terms of gender, mean age, presence of dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia and presence of pneumonia. The mortality rate was 13.2% in COPD, 7% in non-COPD patients(p = 0.092). The significant predictors of mortality were higher age, lymphopenia (p < 0.001), hypoxemia (p = 0.028), high D-dimer level (p = 0.011), and presence of pneumonia (p = 0.043) in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional study on adult HD and PD patients when the curfew measures were in effect. We used an electronic form composed of 3 sections to collect data. In the first section, we collected data on the demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. The second and third sections consisted of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: The HD (n = 116) and PD (n = 130) groups were similar regarding age and sex, and they had similar HADS anxiety scores. HADS depression scores were higher in PD patients (p = 0.052). IES-R scores were significantly higher in PD patients in comparison to HD patients (p = 0.001). Frequencies of abnormal HADS-anxiety (p = 0.035) and severe psychological impact (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PD patients. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: During the social isolation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, HD patients had better mood profiles than PD patients. A more stable daily routine, an uninterrupted face-to-face contact with health-care workers, and social support among patients in the in-center dialysis environment might be the cause of the favorable mood status.

However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPIC viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPIC mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPIC, but not with WT rSV5.

However, long-term crises received unparallel attention. Researchers have previously carried out a trial that investigated the impact of using chemical means to treat water reservoirs of Um-Baddah Nevachah, a refugee camp located in the western outskirts of Khartoum, Sudan. A double-blind community experimental trial was carried out by randomly adding either chlorine or a placebo to the major water tanks in the area. Data were collected using a mixed-methods study design. The primary input was the quantitative data derived from total coliforms lab tests and records of the local primary healthcare center, while the embedded (nested) portion generated most of the qualitative data from direct face-to-face interviews. As a case analysis, this study aims to critically appraise the original trial. In the Background the authors discussed the context of the trial, approach used, and outcomes. Discussion section included three issues related to the trial: scientific importance, challenges and strategies. DISCUSSION: Importance: There are two factors that contribute to the importance of this study: First, the integrated and systematic approach followed to resolve associated challenges. The study swiftly moved from investigating potential water contamination, to test whether it is related to an endogenous focus that auto-taints drinking water, and finally it explored the impact of tanks chlorination on public health. Second, the longstanding humanitarian context which remains largely underreported in literature. Challenges: funding limitations were among the first obstacles faced. During the fieldwork preparation phase, a lot of work was required to resolve logistical and security challenges. Keeping volunteers motivated was the biggest concern during the last phase of data collection. Strategies: The Matrix Solutions Strategy was developed and used to optimize scarce resources to simultaneously target multiple problems through a single intervention. CONCLUSION: Key lessons learned from the whole experience were: persistence is paramount for the success of studies in precarious situations; lateral thinking generates alternative solutions that are novel, feasibility and practical in resources-limited settings; and finally respecting local culture and regulations is essential for building trust with both authorities and vulnerable societies.","output":"A case analysis of a mass treatment approach to control GI and water-related conditions in Sudan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid proliferation and miniaturization of the wireless and embedded devices has led to the invasion of the Internet of Things in many domains and has reached the healthcare sector to form what is called the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) .

Although equally effective at detecting impairment as other cognitive screens (e.g. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)), sorting tests are not commonly used in this context. This study examines the QuickSort, which is a new brief sorting test that is designed to screen older adults for cognitive impairment. DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING General community and inpatients, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Older (60 years) community-dwelling adults (n = 187) and inpatients referred for neuropsychological assessment (n = 78). A normative subsample (n = 115), screened for cognitive and psychological disorders, was formed from the community sample. MEASUREMENTS Participants were administered the QuickSort, MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The QuickSort requires people to sort nine stimuli by color, shape, and number, and to explain the basis for their correct sorts. Sorting (range = 0-12), Explanation (range = 0-6), and Total (range = 0-18) scores were calculated for the QuickSort. RESULTS The Cognitively Healthy subsample completed the QuickSort within 2 minutes, 50% had errorless performance, and 95% had Total scores of 10 or greater. The likelihood of community-dwelling older adults and inpatients (n = 260) being impaired on either the MMSE or FAB, or both, increased by a factor of 3.75 for QuickSort Total scores of less than 10 and reduced by a factor of 0.23 for scores of 10 or greater. CONCLUSION The QuickSort provides a quick, reliable, and valid alternative to lengthier cognitive screens (e.g., MMSE and FAB) when screening older adults for cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND SCAFFOLD was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (angiographically defined as symptomatic 50% or asymptomatic 80%) at increased risk for adverse events from carotid endarterectomy. Interim 30-day analysis demonstrated low rates of death/stroke/myocardial infarction (DSMI; 3.0%) and stroke (1.1%) in a high surgical risk population. METHODS The rate of DSMI within 30 days plus ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 1 year (primary endpoint) was compared to a predetermined performance goal. Secondary outcomes of freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR; diameter stenosis 80% by core lab angiography, or 50% with clinical symptoms) and restenosis (80% diameter stenosis by core lab angiography) are reported as Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates. RESULTS Of the 312 patients enrolled and treated, 264 were eligible per protocol and evaluable for major adverse events at 30 days, and 244 (92%) of these were evaluable at 1 year. The proportion of patients with DSMI at 1 year was 4.5% and was significantly lower than the prespecified performance goal of 16.9% (p < .00001). The proportion with ipsilateral stroke from 31 to 365 days was 1.2%. The KM estimates of 1-year event probability were 1.6% for CD-TLR and 1.2% for restenosis.

We evaluated self-collection of alternative specimens and compared their sensitivity and cycle threshold (C(T)) values to those of NPS. We visited acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outpatients to collect concomitant NPS and gargle specimens and had patients self-collect gargle and either sputum or spit specimens the next morning. We included 40 patients and collected 40 concomitant NPS and gargle specimens, as well as 40 gargle, 22 spit, and 16 sputum specimens the next day (2 patients could not produce sputum). All specimens were as sensitive as NPS. Gargle specimens had a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.00), whether collected concomitantly with NPS or the next morning.

Within dental education, a large portion of education occurs in preclinical laboratories and clinical environments. There is little to no research on attendance in these settings in dental schools. This point/counterpoint paper examines the pros and cons of mandatory attendance in these highly specialized educational settings. With the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 and continues to impact dental education at the time of publication, this topic has become even more relevant. Viewpoint 1 claims that attendance should be mandatory because a greater exposure to preclinical and clinical environments helps foster better clinical hand skills, critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving skills, and an overall sense of professional identity. It goes on further to suggest that there may be a link between attendance and performance in exams and that attendance is part of the dental school's responsibility.

An online learning platform was developed with the aim of providing high-quality, accessible learning to vascular specialty trainees. We describe the design, delivery and analysis of the first 15 months of the platform. Although originally a regional initiative, we discuss how popularity and feedback led to a rapid expansion of the training programme internationally. METHODS: A fully online educational platform for vascular surgery specialist trainees was developed. The primary aims and ethos of the programme were that it should be easily accessible from any location, convenient, flexible, cooperative and collaborative, social and free financially to access. All learning resources were researched carefully and based on the UK vascular surgery curriculum and 20 seminal papers targeted in the Vascular Specialist Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCSVasc) examination. RESULTS: The project demonstrated that it is feasible to design, build and deliver a postgraduate clinical teaching platform with minimal time requirement, resources and cost while creating and maintaining high-quality content. Rapid national and international uptake has proven there is demand - in addition to overwhelmingly positive feedback from educators and learners, this demonstrates that previously perceived barriers to online education can be overcome. At present, 53 educational sessions have been delivered and are available in the online library, and in the past year (8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021) the website has been accessed 3,877 times. CONCLUSIONS: Although the programme has grown and evolved, a strong focus is being kept on its original ethos and aims - easily accessible, collaborative, free learning resources for all vascular professionals, based on the UK vascular surgery curriculum. Making learning convenient is key. The COVID-19 pandemic may be a watershed moment for a new era of learning. It is an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to share experiences and to develop cohesion within a hospital and network, nationally and worldwide.","output":"Learning in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: development and rapid uptake of an online learning platform for vascular surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between patients with diabetes mellitus and the increased severity and its complications that arise with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: This is a complementary review of literature in which 14 articles published in 2020 were selected. These reviewed articles were written in both Portuguese and English available in the SciELO and PubMed databases. This review also involved searching on websites of international and national organizations in order to gather information published by these bodies about diabetic population and coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-infected individuals. DISCUSSION: The presence of comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals causes an increase in the expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. Diabetes causes metabolic and vascular changes, thus weakening the immune system through the inhibition of the innate immune system and the secretion of various inflammatory cytokines. This hyperinflammation can lead to multiple organ failure. The interaction between this comorbidity and COVID-19 can worsen pre-existing diabetes or predispose the onset of diabetes in non-diabetic individuals.

This paper implements a novel network-based pedestrian flow model at a property-level resolution in the City of Melbourne. Data on Melbournes urban form, land-uses, amenities, and pedestrian walkways as well as weather conditions are used to predict pedestrian flows between different land-use pairs, which are subsequently calibrated against hourly observed pedestrian counts from automated sensors. Calibration allows the model extrapolate pedestrian flows on all streets throughout the city center based on reliable baseline observations, and to forecast how new development projects will change existing pedestrian flows. Longitudinal data availability also allows us to validate how accurate such predictions are by comparing model results to actual pedestrian counts observed in following years. Updating the built-environment data annually, we (1) test the accuracy of different calibration techniques for predicting foot-traffic on the citys streets in subsequent years; (2) assess how changes in the built environment affect changes in foot-traffic; (3) analyze which pedestrian origin-destination flows explain observed foot-traffic during three peak weekday periods; and (4) assess the stability of model predictions over time. We find that annual changes in the built environment have a significant and measurable impact on the spatial distribution of Melbournes pedestrian flows.

Even after more than a year, the economy is yet to return to a semblance of normality. The conference/meeting room is one of the critical sections of offices that might be difficult not to use. This study analyzes the distribution of the virus-laden droplets expelled by coughing inside a conference room, the effect of ventilation rates, and their positioning. The efficacy of masks is studied to get quantitative information regarding the residence time of the droplets. The effects of evaporation, turbulent dispersion, and external forces have been considered for calculating the droplets' trajectories. We have analyzed six cases, of which two are with masks. Change in the ventilation rate from four air changes per hour (ACH) to eight resulted in a 9% increment in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent, while their average residence time was reduced by 8s. The shift in the vents' location has significantly altered droplets' distribution inside a conference room. It results in 1.5% of the injected droplets reaching persons sitting across the table, and a similar indoor environment is not recommended. Wearing a mask in the case of eight ACH has presented the best scenario out of the six cases, with a 6.5% improvement in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent and a 9s decrease in their average residence time compared to the case without a mask. No droplets have reached persons sitting across the table when the infected person is wearing the mask, which follows that a social distancing of 6ft with a mask is adequate in indoor environments. ? 2021 Author(s).","output":"Droplet fate, efficacy of face mask, and transmission of virus-laden droplets inside a conference room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Colombia was first diagnosed in a traveler arriving from Italy on February 26, 2020 However, limited data are available on the origins and number of introductions of COVID-19 into the country We sequenced the causative agent of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from 43 clinical samples we collected, along with another 79 genome sequences available from Colombia We investigated the emergence and importation routes for SARS-CoV-2 into Colombia by using epidemiologic, historical air travel, and phylogenetic observations Our study provides evidence of multiple introductions, mostly from Europe, and documents &gt;12 lineages Phylogenetic findings validate the lineage diversity, support multiple importation events, and demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of epidemiologically linked transmission chains Our results reconstruct the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia and highlight the advantages of genome sequencing to complement COVID-19 outbreak investigations","output":"Genomic Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Media play a key part in shaping nurses' social perception.

Initial measures to reduce the burden to the health care system during the pandemic included deferring elective surgery. These damage control measures did not take into account the mid- and long-term implications. Management of congenital anomalies can be time sensitive with delays resulting in permanent disability, morbidity and increased costs to the healthcare system. This study reports the results of using a novel scoring system that enables triage of time sensitive congenital anomalies and pediatric surgical conditions and how implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS?) principles allowed optimization of resources and reduced the burden to the system while allowing for appropriate care of pediatric patients with urgent urologic surgical conditions. METHODS: We present a prospective case series of patients with congenital urological conditions scheduled and taken to surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. All pediatric urology cases that were pending and or scheduled for surgery at the moment the pandemic struck as well as all cases that presented to the emergency department with urological conditions were triaged and included for analysis using a modified Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive Procedures: Scoring System (MeNTS). A modified MeNTS was implemented for pediatric patients, giving more priority to the impact of deferring surgical intervention on patient's prognosis. An individualized evaluation using this scoring system was applied to each patient. Intra- and postoperative ERAS? principles were applied to all cases operated during the pandemic between March 20th and April 24th to reduce the burden to the healthcare system. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were triaged and included for analysis with a mean age of 6.47 years of age. Adjusted MeNTS showed that all clinically emergent cases had a score of 12 or less. Cases that could be postponed for 2 weeks but no longer had a score between 13 and 15. The ones that could wait 6 weeks or longer had scores higher than 16. Score results were not the same for similar procedures and individualized assessments resulted in scores based on an individual patient's conditions. From the total cases, implementation of ERAS? principles increased outpatient procedures from 68 to 90.4%. CONCLUSION: Our results provide a novel triaging method to rank pediatric urological surgical management based on individualized patient's clinical conditions. Cutoff values of 12 and 16 allowed appropriate triage preventing the postponement of urgent urologic cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementation of ERAS? principles allowed for these procedures to be done in the outpatient setting, preserving valuable healthcare resources. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective cohort study.

It appears that healthier individuals are more willing to accept the vaccine than those who indicated they had minor or chronic health conditions. Also, individuals who were vaccinated appears to be more receptive towards the vaccine than those who were yet to receive the vaccine. Moreover, it emerged that the more the educated individuals have, the more likely they would hold favourable disposition, less hesitant and open to vaccination than those with little or no education.

DESIGN A retrospective service evaluation. Data were extracted from the electronic patient records. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS The first 60 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 1 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, and another 60 inpatients, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 11 March 2019 and 23 April 2019, were included from a district general hospital in East London, UK. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 have lower comorbidity scores, poorer performance status, and a shorter time from referral to death compared to patients without COVID-19. Breathlessness, drowsiness, agitation, and fever are the most prevalent symptoms during COVID-19 compared to pain and drowsiness pre-COVID-19. Time from admission to referral to palliative care is longer for Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients, especially during COVID-19. CONCLUSION Early referral to palliative care is essential in COVID-19, especially for Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. There is urgent need to research why Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients are referred late; how palliative care services have changed; and possible solutions to setting up responsive, flexible, and integrated services.","output":"The need for early referral to palliative care especially for Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups in a COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a service evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a well-established treatment modality for several pediatric end-stage liver diseases owning excellent long-term results.

It is already clear now that its economic impact would be more severe that in the case of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. Although not as deadly as SARS, coronavirus infection has a longer incubation period and leaves about 85% of the infected without any (or with just mild) symptoms which makes it more difficult to track and to contain. Moreover, it appears to be much more contagious than its predecessor. The goods news is that most people recover from the disease and develop antibodies that can protect them from getting infected again (natural vaccination). Those cured might become the key element for the post-virus recovery strategies of tourism organisations. People with the acquired immunity to the virus would be capable of travelling freely without spreading the disease. Airlines, hotels and gastronomy should aim at this group offering them discounts and special offers. However, the problem is how to effectively ensure that everyone who claims to be cured from COVID-19 is telling the truth. Health tracking bracelets, apps, and other advanced technological solutions should be put in place.

Intervention studies focus on whether telehealth delivery of mental health therapy in the pandemic environment was useful and effective. It is clear that the pandemic has brought with it a rise in trauma exposure and consequently impacted on trauma-related mental health. While for many individuals, COVID-19-related events met criteria for a DSM-5 Criterion A event, challenges remain in disentangling trauma exposure from stress, anxiety, and other phenomena. It is important to determine the contexts in which a trauma lens makes a useful contribution to understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and the ways in which this may facilitate recovery.

Nevertheless, community spread of COVID-19 has still occurred. We aimed to assess the settings where COVID-19 transmission occurred and determine the fraction of transmission events that occurred in settings where masks are not usually worn. METHODS: we reviewed detailed information provided by the Hong Kong Department of Health on local COVID-19 cases diagnosed up to 30 September 2020 to determine the most likely settings in which transmission occurred. We classified them in probably mask-on or mask-of and compared the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in these settings. RESULTS: among the 2425 cases (65.3%, 2425/3711) with information on transmission setting, 77.6% of the transmission occurred in household and social settings where face masks are not usually worn. Infections that occurred in mask-on settings were more likely to be asymptomatic (adjusted odds ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.68). CONCLUSIONS: we conclude that universal mask-wearing can reduce transmission, but transmission can continue to occur in settings where face masks are not usually worn. The higher proportion of asymptomatic cases in mask-on settings could be related to a milder disease presentation or earlier case detection.","output":"COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong despite universal masking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic disease, one of whom was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on viral and antibody assays. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein Spike (S) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme II provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin cleavage efficiency. These data support the idea that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. We propose two mechanistically grounded hypotheses for mustelid host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with possible effects that require additional investigation.","output":"Host barriers to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated by ferrets in a high-exposure domestic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision trees play an important role both in Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation.

Nevertheless, recent work showed that by the use of SAT solvers one may calculate the optimal size tree for real-world benchmarks. This paper proposes a novel SAT-based encoding that explicitly models paths in the tree, which enables us to control the trees depth as well as size. At the level of individual SAT calls, we investigate splitting the search space into tree topologies. Our tool outperforms the existing implementation.

We undertook an analysis of COVID-19 patients conveyed by ambulance to hospital to investigate how oxygen saturation and measurements of other vital signs correlate to patient outcomes, to ascertain if clinical deterioration can be predicted with simple community physiological monitoring. Methods A retrospective analysis of routinely collected clinical data relating to patients conveyed to hospital by ambulance was undertaken. We used descriptive statistics and predictive analytics to investigate how vital signs, measured at home by ambulance staff from the South Central Ambulance Service, correlate to patient outcomes. Information on patient comorbidities was obtained by linking the recorded vital sign measurements to the patient's electronic health record at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. ROC analysis was performed using cross-validation to evaluate, in a retrospective fashion, the efficacy of different variables in predicting patient outcomes. Results We identified 1,080 adults with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were conveyed by ambulance to either Basingstoke & North Hampshire Hospital or the Royal Hampshire County Hospital (Winchester) between March 1st and July 31st and whose diagnosis was clinically confirmed at hospital discharge. Vital signs measured by ambulance staff at first point of contact in the community correlated with patient short-term mortality or ICU admission. Oxygen saturations were the most predictive of mortality or ICU admission (AUROC 0.772 (95 % CI: 0.712-0.833)), followed by the NEWS2 score (AUROC 0.715 (95 % CI: 0.670-0.760), patient age (AUROC 0.690 (95 % CI: 0.642-0.737)), and respiration rate (AUROC 0.662 (95 % CI: 0.599-0.729)). Combining age with the NEWS2 score (AUROC 0.771 (95 % CI: 0.718-0.824)) or the measured oxygen saturation (AUROC 0.820 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.854)) increased the predictive ability but did not reach significance. Conclusions Initial oxygen saturation measurements (on air) for confirmed COVID-19 patients conveyed by ambulance correlated with short-term (30-day) patient mortality or ICU admission, AUROC: 0.772 (95% CI: 0.712-0.833).

Social media play a crucial role in propagating misinformation about vaccination, including through conspiracy theories and can negatively impact trust in vaccination. Users typically engage with multiple social media platforms; however, little is known about the role and content of cross-platform use in spreading vaccination-related information. This study examined the content and dynamics of YouTube videos shared in vaccine-related tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations before the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. We screened approximately 144 million tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations and identified 930,539 unique tweets in English that discussed vaccinations posted between 1 February and 23 June 2020. We then identified links to 2,097 unique YouTube videos that were tweeted. Analysis of the video transcripts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling and independent coders indicate the dominance of conspiracy theories. Following the World Health Organizations declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, anti-vaccination frames rapidly transitioned from claiming that vaccines cause autism to pandemic conspiracy theories, often featuring Bill Gates. Content analysis of the 20 most tweeted videos revealed that the majority (n = 15) opposed vaccination and included conspiracy theories. Their spread on Twitter was consistent with spamming and coordinated efforts. These findings show the role of cross-platform sharing of YouTube videos over Twitter as a strategy to propagate primarily anti-vaccination messages.

To date, there has not been a retrospective cohort study comparing procedures performed at urban versus rural emergency departments (EDs). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare procedures performed by EM residents in urban versus rural EDs, with the hypothesis that there will be no significant difference in the procedures performed. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing procedures performed by second- and third-year EM residents based on medical chart review. The procedures were counted at three locations in West Virginia, including a small rural ED, a large rural ED, and a tertiary care ED. Procedure notes were collected from September 2018 to September 2019. The final analysis included nine months, as three months did not have residents at all locations. Eight procedures were standardized based on the number of procedures performed per 100 hours worked by residents. A comparison of total procedures and complex versus simple procedures was performed. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed to compare resident hours for procedures between each of the three locations. To compare each of the hospitals to one another separately, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed. Results: The total resident hours worked included 1,800 at the small rural ED, 13,725.5 at the tertiary care ED, and 5,319 at the large rural ED. A p-value of 0.0311 for the Kruskal-Wallis H Test indicated a difference between at least two of the ED sites. A statistically significant difference exists (p-value = 0.0135) between the urban ED (95% CI: 0.15-0.62) and the large rural ED (95% CI: 0.54-1.53). There was no significant difference in complex versus simple procedures among the three locations (p-value = 0.4159). Conclusions: When compared with the tertiary care ED, residents performed more total procedures at the large rural ED and similar total procedure numbers at the small rural ED when standardized for hours worked.

The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22% (range: 2% to 78%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches. We recommend that future assessment of reference points and quotas include reproductive hyperallometry unless there is clear evidence that it does not occur in that species.","output":"Reproductive hyperallometry and managing the world's fisheries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and frequently presented as a virus primarily affecting older adults.

On the social media platform of Twitter, #BoomerRemover was used as a hashtag to express views related to older adults, and particularly baby boomers, as the primary targets of COVID-19. This study uses qualitative methods to analyze the messages of Twitter users that discuss COVID-19 with the use of the hashtag #BoomerRemover. A total of 1,875 tweets posted in English and including the hashtag #BoomerRemover from March 16, 2020 to March 30, 2020 were analyzed. Analytic methods employed an open coding procedure consistent with grounded theory and Numeric Content Analysis (Marks, 2015). Salient themes include: (1) COVID-19 is Politically Driven (2) Theres a Real Intergenerational Divide, (3) Young People are Dying Too, and (4) #BoomerRemover is Simply Disrespectful. Findings suggest that only about a fourth of #BoomerRemover tweets could be considered ageist, and the large majority of tweets using the hashtag were related to politics and elections. Further, several of those using the #BoomerRemover hashtag to defend older adults were inadvertently causing it to remain relevant (trend) as a Twitter topic.

Methods: With the help of the principles of the German philosopher Kant, the thinking and planning is framed. Results: The modelling by the researchers of the Imperial College, London, make an oversized second wave in autumn/winter 2020 most likely, if the current countermeasures are kept in place for too long. A timely relaxation of the measures is warranted to allow a staggered attack by the virus onto the population (German: Durchseuchung) before the next influenza season 2020/2021 without overburdening the health care infrastructure especially the respiratory care bed capacity. The tempting perspective of a vaccine available before the second wave in autumn, should not lead to any delay in the intermittent relaxation of the countermeasures. A pre-licensure marginally tested vaccine would only be eligible for people with an anyway high risk in regard to SARS-CoV?2.

Early childhood educators may become empowered with suggestions and guidance for integrating technology with early literacy development. ? 2021, IGI Global.","output":"Using technology to teach foundational writing skills in early elementary grades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Attempts to improve child protection outcomes by implementing social work practice models embedded in a particular theory and practice approach, have increased internationally over the past decade. OBJECTIVE To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of child protection practice models in improving outcomes for children and families. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Children < 18 years and their families involved in child protection services. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the effectiveness of child protection practice models. Systematic searches across 10 electronic databases and grey literature were conducted to identify quasi-experimental studies minimally. Included studies were critically appraised and the findings summarized narratively. RESULTS Five papers, representing six studies, focusing on three practice models (Solution-Based Casework; Signs of Safety; and Reclaiming Social Work) met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a quasi-experimental design. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as being poor, with studies suffering from a risk of selection bias, small sample sizes and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS Despite the popularity of practice models, the evidence base for their effectiveness is still limited. The results suggest that high-quality studies are urgently needed to evaluate the impact of practice models in improving the outcomes of child-protection-involved families. The findings also illustrate the difficulties of conducting high-quality outcome evaluations in children's social care, and these challenges and future directions for research, are discussed.

The purpose of this study is twofold: to bring digital storytelling to the forefront as a literacy practice within classrooms that seeks to privilege students voices and experiences and also to encapsulate the authors different experiences and perspectives as teachers. The authors sought to understand how pre-teacher education candidates analyzed, understood and made meaning from their classmates digital stories using the seven elements of digital storytelling (Dreon et al., 2011).Design/methodology/approachUsing grounded theory (Charmaz, 2008) as a framework, the question of how do high school pre-teacher education program candidates reflectively peer review their classmates digital stories is addressed and discussed through university and high school instructors narrative reflections. Through peer reviews of their fellow classmates digital stories, students were able to use the digital storytelling guide that included the seven elements of digital storytelling planning to critique and offer suggestions. The authors used the 2018C2019 and 2019C2020 cohorts digital stories, digital storytelling guides and peer reviews to discover emerging categories and themes and then made sense of these through narrative analysis. This study looks at students narratives through the contexts of peer reviews.FindingsThe seven elements of digital storytelling, as noted by Dreon et al. (2011, p. 5), which are point of view, dramatic question, emotional content, the gift of your voice, the power of the soundtrack, economy and pacing, were used as starting points for coding students responses in their evaluations of their peers digital stories. Situated on the premise of 21st century technologies as important promoters of differentiated ways of teaching and learning that are highly interactive (Greenhow et al., 2009), digital stories and students reflective practices of peer reviewing were the foundational aspects of this paper.Research limitations/implicationsThe research the authors have done has been in regards to reviewing and analyzing students peer reviews of their classmates digital stories, so the authors did not conduct a research study empirical in nature. What the authors have done is to use students artifacts (digital story, digital storytelling guides and reflections/peer reviews) to allow students authentic voices and perspectives to emerge without their own perspectives marring these. The authors, as teachers, are simply the tools of analysis.Practical implicationsIn reading this paper, teachers of different grade levels will be able to obtain ideas on using digital storytelling in their classrooms first. Second, teachers will be able to obtain hands-on tools for implementing digital storytelling. For example, the digital storytelling guide to which the authors refer (Figure 1) can be used in different subject areas to help students plan their stories. Teachers will also be able to glean knowledge on using students peer reviews as a kind of authentic assessment.Social implicationsThe authors hope in writing and presenting this paper is that teachers and instructors at different levels, K-12 through higher education, will consider digital storytelling as a pedagogical and learning practice to spark deeper conversations within the classroom that flow beyond margins and borders of instructional settings out into the community and beyond. The authors hope that others will use opportunities for storytelling, digital, verbal, traditional writing and other ways to spark conversations and privilege students voices and lives.Originality/valueAs the authors speak of the original notion of using students crucial events as story starters, this is different than prior research for digital storytelling that has focused on lesson units or subject area content. Also, because the authors have used crucial events, this is an entry point to students lives and the reation of rapport within the classroom.","output":"Digital stories, material transformations: reflections of education students in a pre-teacher program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence continues to grow supporting the aerosol transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2). To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from ten different locations in multiple air handlers.

The increase of the incidence of COVID-19 came partly from a new cluster, that was a family cluster. The emergence of this cluster was very dangerous because the transmission had entered the smallest unit of society, that was a family. This study aimed to find out if there were differences in family behavior in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in urban and rural areas in East Java. Comparative analytics was used as the design of this study. The population in this study were all families in East Java. The research sample after being calculated using the Taro Yamane formula obtained 384 respondents and collected 393 respondents those were 282 respondents in urban areas and 111 in rural areas.

Objective: To collect and synthesize information regarding COVID-19 vaccination programs in each of the provinces and territories (P/Ts). Methods: Provincial/territorial public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics, drawn from scientific literature and media: unique factors for COVID-19 vaccination, adoption of National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, priority groups for early vaccination, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Data were grouped according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Eighteen interviews occurred with 25 participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. Factors unique to COVID-19 vaccination included prioritizing groups for early vaccination (n=7), public perception of vaccines (n=6), and differing eligibility criteria (n=5). Almost all P/Ts (n=10) reported reliance on NACI recommendations. Long-term care residents (n=10) and health care workers (n=10) were most frequently prioritized for early vaccination, followed by people with chronic medical conditions (n=9) and seniors (n=8). Most P/Ts (n=9) are planning routine adverse event monitoring to assess vaccine safety. Evaluation of effectiveness was anticipated to occur within public health departments (n=3), by researchers (n=3), or based on national guidance (n=4).

Although meat means an important source of nutrients, it is also evident that a great consumption of this source of proteins has also a negative environmental impact. Livestock production does not only have a negative influence on GHG emissions, but also on the water footprint, water pollution, and water scarcity. With respect to human health, in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that red meat was a probable carcinogen to humans (Group 2A), while consumption of processed meat was carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Most environmental contaminants (PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, PCNs, etc.) that are frequently found in meats are highly soluble in fats. Therefore, avoiding ingesting fats from red meats and meat products, doubtless would help in the prevention, not only of the well-known cardiovascular diseases derived of fats consumption, but also of certain kinds of cancers, mainly colorectal cancer. On the other hand, consumption of meat C especially wild meat C is related to virus infections, as many viruses have been found in wild meat trade markets. Based on the scientific literature here reviewed, we have noted that the results of the investigations conducted after the statement of the IARC, have corroborated the recommendation of reducing significantly the consumption of red meats and meat products. In turn, the reduction of meat consumption should contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and their considerable impact on global warming and climate change.

An increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection or breakthrough infection should be concerned. Here we reported higher humoral immune response elicited by Delta and Omicron variants after breaking through previous infection and cross-neutralization against VOCs, compared to the ancestral wild-type (WT) virus infection. To overcome the immune escape of Omicron, Omicron-specific vaccine was considered as a novel and potential strategy. Mouse models were used to verify whether Omicron-specific RBD subunit boost immune response by immunizing Omicron-RBD recombinant proteins. Three doses of Omicron-RBD immunization elicit comparable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers with three doses of WT-RBD immunization, but the neutralizing activity was not cross-active. By contrast, two doses of WT-RBD with an Omicron-RBD booster increased the NAb geometric mean titers against Omicron by 9 folds. Moreover, an additional boost vaccination with Omicron-RBD protein could increase humoral immune response against both WT and current VOCs. These results suggest that the Omicron-specific subunit booster shows its advantages in the immune protection from both WT and current VOCs, and that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administration using two or more virus lineages as antigens might improve the NAb response.","output":"Extensive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants elicited by Omicron-specific subunit vaccine booster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase risk for the development of health anxiety.

We have focused on three viral disease groups of concern: Filoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Henipaviruses. Methods We modelled presence-absence data in spatially explicit binomial and zero-inflation binomial logistic regression with and without autoregression. Presence data were extracted from published studies for the three EID groups. Various environmental and demographical rasters were used to explain the distribution of EIDs.

A small number of care homes (10.4%, n=8) had asymptomatic cases and over a third had no clinical or asymptomatic cases (36.4%, n=28). There was no significant difference between the overall Care Quality Commission rating of Liverpool and English care homes (p=0.57). There was no significant association between any of the Care Quality Commission rating domains and the presence of COVID-19 outbreaks and/or asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Care Quality Commission ratings were not associated with COVID-19 outbreaks or asymptomatic cases in care homes. Infection prevention and control components of Care Quality Commission ratings need to be strengthened to identify care homes at a potential risk of infectious disease outbreaks that may require targeted support. Further large-scale studies will be required to test the findings from this study.","output":"COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes during the first wave: Are Care Quality Commission ratings a good predictor of at risk homes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nano-particles have been combined with antibiotics in recent studies to overcome multidrug-resistant bacteria. Here, we synthesized a nano-material in which Ag nano-particles were assembled with a ZnO nano-structure to form an Ag-ZnO (AZO) nano-composite at low temperature. This material was combined with erythromycin (Ery), an antibiotic effective towards gram-positive bacteria, using three different approaches (AZO + Ery (AZE) [centrifuged (AZE1), used separately after 1-h gap (AZE2), without centrifugation (AZE3)]) to prepare a nano-antibiotic against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Ag nano-particles and ZnO nano-structure. The elemental and chemical state of the elements present in the AZO nano-composite were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The antibacterial activity of AZE samples against both Escherichia coli and S. aureus strains including MRSA was evaluated in antibacterial and morphological analyses. The AZE3 sample showed greater antibacterial activity than the other samples and was comparable to erythromycin. AZE3 was ~20-fold less prone to developing bacterial resistance following multiple exposures to bacteria compared to erythromycin alone. The AZE3 nano-composite showed good biocompatibility with 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Our newly synthesized nano-platform antibiotics may be useful against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.","output":"A New Nano-Platform of Erythromycin Combined with Ag Nano-Particle ZnO Nano-Structure against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current world of Internet people express themselves, present their views and feelings about specific topics or entities using various social media application.

We use the statistics of confirmed cases of China excl. Hubei. Also the daily data on travel activity within China was utilized, in order to determine the actual numerical development of the infected people in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. We used a multivariate Monte Carlo optimization to parameterize the model to match the official statistics.

In the setting of a cytokine storm syndrome and infection, collaborative involvement of specialists, including infectious disease and rheumatology is ideal. Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been used subcutaneously and intravenously in pediatric patients and is considered a first-line treatment for MAS and secondary HLH (sHLH) among many pediatric rheumatologists.

In this study, we examined the adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid (R203K/G204R) of SARS-CoV-2 that arose on the background of the spike D614G change and describe how strains harboring these changes became dominant circulating strains globally. METHODS: Deep-sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases and from clinical samples were analyzed to identify and map genetic variants and sub-genomic RNA transcripts across the genome. Results: Sequence analysis suggests that the 3 adjacent nucleotide changes that result in the K203/R204 variant have arisen by homologous recombination from the core sequence of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) rather than by stepwise mutation. The resulting sequence changes generate a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript for the C-terminal dimerization domain of nucleocapsid. Deep-sequencing data from 981 clinical samples confirmed the presence of the novel TRS-CS-dimerization domain RNA in individuals with the K203/R204 variant. Quantification of sub-genomic RNA indicates that viruses with the K203/R204 variant may also have increased expression of sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that homologous recombination from the TRS may have occurred since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, resulting in both coding changes and novel sub-genomic RNA transcripts, suggests this as a mechanism for diversification and adaptation within its new host.","output":"Generation of a Novel SARS-CoV-2 Sub-genomic RNA Due to the R203K/G204R Variant in Nucleocapsid: Homologous Recombination has Potential to Change SARS-CoV-2 at Both Protein and RNA Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This case series highlights a possible association between isolated facial nerve palsy and SARS-CoV-2 Caution should be exercised in the use of steroids in patients with COVID-19 as its impact is still not well established","output":"The great pretenderBells palsy secondary to SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalent respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 probably persist for a long time on fomites and environmental surfaces.

The rapid airborne transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, call for active containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best strategy to date is to isolate diagnosed cases of infection, thus preventing further transmission. This technique consists on test the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of infected, and treat by quarantine all these cases, namely Test-Track-Treat (TTT). The dynamical process that better describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number \${\\\\cal R}_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade-off between the infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not bent. However, when contact tracing is applied, the strategy bends the curve leading to a fast suppression of the epidemic outbreak. We illustrate this qualitative difference between the two strategies and identify the factors that explain the effectiveness of contact tracing in sharply reversing the upward trend of the original epidemic curve, causing its bending.","output":"Virus spread versus contact tracing: two competing contagion processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had so far claimed more than 600 000 lives worldwide Many urgent and elective surgeries were postponed to cope with the pandemic, with the latest data found a substantial postoperative mortality risk (25 6%, 18 9%) after an emergency and elective surgery, respectively Our institution was one of the first few in the country to offer essential elective surgery using a COVID-free designated site during the start of the pandemic This study aims to analyze the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent essential elective procedures during the virus outbreak in the UK Methods Retrospective analysis of outcomes of all patients who had undergone urgent elective and cancer surgery, from 30th March 2020 to 21st May 2020, using an implemented Super Green Pathway  The primary endpoints were 30 days mortality and COVID-related morbidities, and the secondary end-points were surgically related complications and oncological outcomes Results A total of 92 patients (Male: 45%;Female: 55%) across 5 surgical specialties were identified There was no record of mortality in our cohort Only 1 patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 18 days after the initial operation without any pulmonary complications There were 7 postoperative surgical complications managed at the acute hospital site The waiting time for surgery ranges from 6 to 191 days, mean of 30 days, and a median of 23 days Conclusion It is possible to mitigate the high mortality risk of post-operative complications associated with COVID-19, with no delay to essential surgeries for cancer patients, thus delivering safe practice during the pandemic","output":"The super green pathway;what have we learned so far?

Apart from cognitive decline, dementia is associated with multiple pathophysiology, including increased oxidative stress, dysregulated gene expressions, cytokine, neurotrophin, and stress markers, telomere shortening, and deteriorations in brain connectivity. Although mindfulness practices have been proposed to ameliorate these biological changes, no empirical studies were conducted. We thus aimed to investigate the effects of mindfulness awareness practice (MAP) to prevent cognitive decline and improve peripheral biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods/Design: This was a single-blinded and parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two arms (intervention and active control arms), conducted over nine months. A total of 60 consenting community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with MCI were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the MAP or the Health Education Program (HEP). Interventions were performed weekly for the initial 12 weeks, and monthly for the subsequent six months. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 3-month, and 9-month post-intervention by blinded assessors. Primary outcomes were neurocognitive tests, comprehensive peripheral biomarkers, and brain imaging scans. Secondary outcomes included basic health screening measures, affective symptoms, and measures of physical functions. Linear-mixed models were used to examine the effects of MAP on these outcome measures. Significance: This is the first randomized controlled trial to systematically investigate the effects of a mindfulness intervention in improving cognitive functions and various biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with MCI.

Over nineteen years, two percent (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a ~4,000 km national investment project, increased by 1,554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes.

Microglia in animal models cannot accurately model the properties of human microglia due to notable transcriptomic and functional differences between human and other animal microglia. Efficient generation of microglia from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides unprecedented opportunities to study the function and behavior of human microglia. Particularly, incorporating hPSCs-derived microglia into brain organoids facilitates their development in a 3-dimensional context, mimicking the brain environment. However, an optimized method that integrates an appropriate amount of microglia into brain organoids at a proper time point, resembling in vivo brain development, is still lacking. Here, we report the development of a new brain region-specific, microglia-containing organoid model by co-culturing hPSCs-derived primitive neural progenitor cells (pNPCs) and primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs). In these organoids, hPSCs-derived pNPCs and PMPs interact with each other and develop into functional neurons, astroglia, and microglia, respectively. Importantly, the numbers of human microglia in the organoids can be controlled, resulting in a cell type ratio similar to that seen in the human brain. Using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that these human microglia are able to phagocytize neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and dead cells, as well as to prune synapses at different developmental stages of the organoids. Furthermore, these human microglia respond to Zika virus infection of the organoids, as indicated by amoeboid-like morphology, increased expression of gene transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines, and excessive pruning of synaptic materials. Together, our findings establish a new microglia-containing brain organoid model that will serve to study human microglial function in a variety of neurological disorders.","output":"Developing Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Cerebral Organoids with a Controllable Microglia Ratio for Modeling Brain Development and Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wow! is my little granddaughters favourite word She reserves it for wonderful things, like puddles, and cats that dont run away when she tries to stroke them","output":"If only nurses were running test and trace"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections.

In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease.

In the field of mental healthcare, involvement of family members is perceived as beneficial to the recovery process of the care recipient. Furthermore, family care-giving is an essential part of elderly care. It is well documented that family members need support to prevent negative consequences of care-giving. Nevertheless, involvement of and support for family caregivers have not developed into a common practice, and research has identified professional barriers to collaboration with family caregivers in several areas. The aim of this study was to explore professionals' experiences of collaboration with family caregivers of older persons with mental health problems, and how they understood their responsibility towards families. We conducted three focus group interviews with 18 health and social care professionals working in community-based services, in three rural municipalities in Western Norway. The thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke guided the analysis. The findings in relation to the professionals' role and responsibility towards family caregivers are presented in three themes: family caregivers - a resource that needs support; a responsibility with unclear boundaries; and balancing different needs. Professionals recognised family caregivers' need for support and acknowledged the importance of family relationships. However, they experienced dilemmas in performing their dual responsibility of caring for the older care recipient as well as the family member, which they described as having unclear guidelines. They also experienced that they had insufficient knowledge to take on this responsibility. We argue that the exercising of discretion is essential for the professionals' responsibility, and that clarification of their responsibility is needed. We recommend a stronger focus in education on developing competence in the family perspective. Furthermore, the apportionment of professionals' responsibility needs to be formalised, especially when several services are involved in providing care.","output":"Professionals' understanding of their responsibilities in the collaboration with family caregivers of older persons with mental health problems in Norway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There have been rapid shifts in outpatient care models during the COVID-19 pandemic but the impact of these changes on patient outcomes are uncertain. We designed this study to examine ambulatory outpatient visit patterns and outcomes between March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 (pre-pandemic) and from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 (pandemic). Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all 3.8 million adults in the Canadian province of Alberta, which has a single payer healthcare system, using linked administrative data. We examined all outpatient physician encounters (virtual or in-person) and outcomes (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths) in the next 30- and 90-days. Results: Although in-person outpatient visits declined by 38.9% in the year after March 1, 2020 (10,142,184 vs. 16,592,599), the increase in virtual visits (7,152,147; 41.4% of total) meant that total outpatient encounters increased by 4.1% in the first year of the pandemic. Outpatient care and prescribing patterns remained stable for adults with ambulatory-care sensitive conditions (ACSC): 97.2% saw a primary care physician (median 6 visits), 59.0% had at least one specialist visit, and 98.5% were prescribed medications (median 9) in the year prior to the pandemic compared to 96.6% (median 3 in-person and 2 virtual visits), 62.6%, and 98.6% (median 8 medications) during the first year of the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, virtual outpatient visits were associated with less subsequent healthcare encounters than in-person ambulatory visits, particularly for patients with ACSC (9.2% vs. 10.4%, aOR 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.87-0.92] at 30 days and 26.9% vs. 29.3%, aOR 0.93 [0.92-0.95] at 90 days).

Setting and participants We surveyed all hospital employees at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden in September 2020 and compared results across departments and to the results of a large employee survey from October 2019. Results: The overall impact of the pandemic on perceived working conditions and possibility for recovery differed among departments. During the pandemic, healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients reported poorer working environments than other employees. Factors significantly related to perception of work environment and recovery during the pandemic included worries of being infected, departmental transfer, and having insufficient access to personal protective equipment. Men reported better working conditions than women in all, but one item and higher age was related to better perceived working environment. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the pandemic differentially affects hospital departments and underscores the multifactorial nature of this topic. Contributing factors to poor perceived working environment could be addressed at times of high workload, such as during the pandemic, including providing appropriate support to managers, ensuring possibility for recovery during working hours, and acknowledging worries about infection.

This study describes the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and identified factors associated with the severity of illness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational study of 341 COVID-19 cases. These cases were reported in the first three months after the first case in the country was identified. Clinical and demographic data were analyzed and described to identify the effects of age, sex, and ethnicity on illness severity. In addition, the duration of viral shedding and cycle threshold (Ct) values of real-time PCR were evaluated as predictors of severity. RESULTS: The median age was 45 years. Males were twice as likely to be infected than females (p <0.0001). The duration of viral shedding ranged from 9 to 36 days. The most common clinical presentations include fever, shortness of breath, cough, myalgia, sore throat, vomiting, and headache. Critical cases were significantly higher in men (23% vs 8.7%), senior adults (>65 years), individuals of Bengali ethnicity, and in patients with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (p =0.001). The case fatality rate was found to be 10%. The fatality was significantly higher in males than females (13.8% vs 2.6%), and in Asians (17.9%) than Arabs (6%) and Africans (0) (p =0.002). No association was found between viral load, represented by the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, and severity of illness. CONCLUSION: Age, sex, and ethnicity are important predictors of COVID-19 severity.

The redirection is based on a significantly more densely braided wire stent. The stent wall keeps the blood in the lumen of the stent and slows down the turbulent flow in the aneurysms. Stagnation of blood in the aneurysm sac leads to the formation of thrombus and subsequent exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. The aim of the study was to evaluate flow diverter device Pipeline for broad neck and giant aneurysm treatment. METHODS Fifteen patients with discovered aneurysm of the internal carotid artery were treated between November 2010 and February 2014. The majority of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery were located intradural at the ophthalmic part of the artery. The patients were treated using a flow diverter device Pipeline, which was placed over the aneurysm neck. Treatment success was assessed clinically and angiographically using O'Kelly Marotta scale. RESULTS Control angiography immediately after the release of the stent showed stagnation of the blood flow in the aneurysm sac. In none of the patients procedural and periprocedural complications were observed. 6 months after the procedure, control CT or MR angiography showed in almost all cases exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation and normal blood flow in the treated artery. Neurological status six months after the procedure was normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of aneurysms with flow diverter Pipeline device is a safe and significantly less time consuming method in comparison with standard techniques. This new method is a promising approach in treatment of broad neck aneurysms.","output":"Endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms of cavernous and ophthalmic segment of internal carotid artery with flow diverter device Pipeline."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

A team of radiologists and medical physicists performed 25 phantom CT studies using different automatic tube current modulation settings (SUREExposure3D technology). We then conducted a retrospective evaluation of the chest CT images from 22 patients with COVID-19 and calculated the density difference between the GGO and unaffected tissue. Finally, the results were matched to the phantom study results to determine the minimum noise index threshold value. The minimum density difference at the onset of COVID-19 was 252 HU (p < 0.001). This was found to correspond to the SUREExposure 3D noise index of 36. We established the noise index threshold of 36 for the Canon scanner without iterative reconstructions, allowing for a decrease in the dose-length product by 80%.

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is said to double, even triple survival from cardiac arrest, and hence it is crucial to ensure optimal acquisition and retention of these skills. In this study, we aim to compare a VR CPR teaching program to current teaching methods with content validation of the VR course. METHODS: A randomized single-blinded simulation-based pilot study where 26 participants underwent baseline assessment of their CPR skills using a validated checklist and Laerdal QCPR?. Participants were randomly allocated and underwent their respective courses. This was followed by a final assessment and a questionnaire for content validation, knowledge and confidence. The data was analysed using STATA 16.2 to determine the standardized mean difference using paired and unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Subjective assessment using the checklist showed statistically significant improvement in the overall scores of both groups (traditional group mean improved from 6.92 to 9.61 p-value 0.0005, VR group from 6.61 to 8.53 p-value 0.0016). However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the final scores in both the subjective and objective assessments.

Finally, the content validation showed statistically significant improvement in ease of use (mean score 3 to 4.23 p-value of 0.0144), while for content, positivity of experience, usefulness and appropriateness participants showed similar satisfaction before and after use. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that VR teaching could deliver CPR skills in an attractive manner, with no inferiority in acquisition of these skills compared to traditional methods. To corroborate these findings, we suggest a follow-up study with a larger sample size after adding ventilation and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) skills to the VR course with re-examination after 3C6 months to test retention of the skills.","output":"Comparison of a virtual reality compression-only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) course to the traditional course with content validation of the VR course C A randomized control pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Infective endocarditis and myocarditis are rarely diagnosed conditions with high mortality rates in dogs and cats. As their clinical signs are highly nonspecific, and advanced cardiological diagnostics are not always available in small animal clinics, both diseases seem to be underdiagnosed. Infective endocarditis affects mainly the mitral and aortic valves. In myocarditis, thickening of the left ventricle walls is usually observed; however, in some cases dilatation of the left ventricle lumen with thinning of the walls can be visible. In human medicine, basic cardiac ultrasound examination enables a quick initial diagnosis of these two conditions. Using this technique, we tentatively diagnosed 7 cases of myocarditis and/or infective endocarditis in dogs and cats, and these diagnoses were later confirmed by other methods. Because the initial diagnoses were made by a general practitioner after relatively short training, not by a cardiology specialist, we conclude that common use of this technique in small animal practices equipped with ultrasound device could increase the rate of diagnosis of these conditions, leading to earlier treatment initiation. ABSTRACT: Symptoms of infective endocarditis (IE) and myocarditis are usually nonspecific and include fever, apathy, and loss of appetite. This condition can lead to severe heart failure with ascites or/and fluid in the thoracic cavity or/and in the pericardial sac. We describe infective endocarditis and myocarditis in 3 dogs and 4 cats. In all animals, the initial diagnosis was performed on the basis of a focused cardiac ultrasound examination performed by a general practitioner after a training in this technique. The initial findings were confirmed by a board-certified specialist in veterinary cardiology. Post mortem positive microbiological results from valves were obtained in 4 of 7 patients. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed in 2 cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis was confirmed in 2 cases, one of which included Enterococcus sp. coinfection. Histopathological examination confirmed initial diagnosis in 5 of 7 animals. In the remaining 2 patients, the time elapsed from the onset of clinical symptoms to death was about 1 month and no active inflammation but massive fibrosis was found microscopically. This is, to our best knowledge, the first report of IE and myocarditis diagnosed in small animals using focused cardiac ultrasound examination. Therefore, we conclude that common usage of this technique by trained general veterinarians may increase the rate of diagnosed patients with these conditions.","output":"Focused Cardiac Ultrasound Examination as a Tool for Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis and Myocarditis in Dogs and Cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ŀ ̽,͹״Σ֢ζҽԺԮʿҽԺȾѵ͹ķ  ۺֳڿΡѵпרԱƵطճѲ鷨鷨ʡҽƶӵĻԱ¹ڶҽԺȾѵ  Խʡ100ԱΪ,ڳԮ51dȫȫ,ҽԱȾ͹״  ͹״׾ζҽԺȾطڳԮʿҽԺȾѵ͹ȡ˽ϺЧ,ʱҽԺȾҪ,ҽԱְҵȫ","output":"Training on and management of nosocomial infection prevention for the aiding nurses allocated to the hospital designated for the treatment of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Desde sempre a humanidade se aflige com o fim da existncia Em algumas ocasi?es, como a atual pandemia do novo coronavrus, percebemos sua presen?a mais de perto At que ponto o medo da morte pode alterar percep??es e cren?as dos indivduos?  nesse contexto de incertezas e medos que decidimos investigar de que modo a sociedade brasileira vem avaliando seus governantes, sobretudo em rela??o  poltica de isolamento social A pandemia da COVID-19 alterou os eixos da polariza??o poltica De um lado, governadores, prefeitos e legisladores preocupados com os riscos de estrangulamento do sistema de sade causado pela pandemia De outro, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro, focado primordialmente nas consequncias econ?micas negativas da poltica de isolamento social Por meio de uma pesquisa de opini?o, identificamos que o &quot;medo da morte&quot;diminuiu a polariza??o ideolgica existente no Brasil desde a elei??o de Jair Bolsonaro  presidncia da Repblica Ao contrrio do que muitos esperavam, os eleitores que se auto-identificaram como de direita e centro-direita - supostamente, o ncleo de eleitores de Bolsonaro - rejeitaram seguir a recomenda??o e avaliam mal a performance de seu lder Tambm mostramos que essa mudan?a de comportamento n?o foi influenciada pelos diferentes nveis de renda Resumen La humanidad siempre se ha afligido por el fin de la existencia En algunas ocasiones, como en la pandemia actual del nuevo coronavirus, esa afliccin se hace ms presente ?Hasta qu punto puede el miedo a la muerte alterar las percepciones y creencias de los individuos?

The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","output":"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inappropriate platelet aggregation creates a cardiovascular risk that is largely managed with thienopyridines and aspirin. Although effective, these drugs carry risks of increased bleeding and drug resistance, underpinning a drive for new antiplatelet agents. To discover such drugs, one strategy is to identify a suitable druggable target and then find small molecules that modulate it. A good and unexploited target is the platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, which promotes thrombus formation. To identify inhibitors of GPVI that are safe and bioavailable, we docked a FDA-approved drug library into the GPVI collagen-binding site in silico. We now report that losartan and cinanserin inhibit GPVI-mediated platelet activation in a selective, competitive and dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action likely underpins the cardioprotective effects of losartan that could not be ascribed to its antihypertensive effects. We have, therefore, identified small molecule inhibitors of GPVI-mediated platelet activation, and also demonstrated the utility of structure-based repurposing.","output":"Discovery of Novel GPVI Receptor Antagonists by Structure-Based Repurposing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to thoroughly document the effects of multiple intervention and control methods to mitigate the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Pudong New Area, Shanghai.

Epidemiological features of cases detected by three different strategies were compared to assess the impact of these active surveillance measures. As of February 16, 2020, a total of 108 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified in Pudong, Shanghai. Forty-five (41.67%) cases were identified through active surveillance measures, with 22 (20.37%) identified by CC tracing and 23 (21.30%) by quarantine of potential exposure populations (PEPs). The average interval from illness onset to the first medical visit was 1 day. Cases identified by CC tracing and PEPs were quarantined for 0.5 and 1 day before illness onset, respectively. The time intervals from illness onset to the first medical visit and isolation among actively screened cases were 2 days (p = .02) and 3 days (p = .00) shorter, respectively, than those among self-admission cases.

Figure 1. CLABSI rate in 2019 vs CLABSI rate in 2020 A comparison of CLABSI rates (displayed in infections/1000 catheter days) in all adult inpatients at our institution for calendar-years 2019 and 2020 Methods Retrospective review was done for all CLABSI in adults meeting National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria in 2020 at an 889-bed teaching hospital. CLABSIs in encounters with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (COVID CLABSI) were compared with CLABSIs in encounters without a COVID diagnosis (non-COVID CLABSI). As a secondary analysis, we also reviewed all CLABSI occurrence in 2019. Characteristics were compared using Mid-P Exact (Poisson) and Chi Squared (categorical) Tests. Subjective data collected by infection preventionists during real-time case reviews with clinical staff of each CLABSI was also reviewed. Results In 2020, the rate of COVID CLABSI (CLABSI/1000 catheter days) was 6.6 times greater than the rate of non-COVID CLABSI (5.47 vs. 0.83, p< 0.001). In the COVID CLABSI group we observed higher rates of occurrence in the ICU setting (94% vs 28%, p< 0.001), in house mortality (53% vs 26% P=0.0187), presence of arterial lines (91% vs 20%, p< 0.001) and increased number of catheter lumens (4 vs 3, p< 0.001). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of pathogens. No significant differences were observed between 2019 CLABSI and 2020 non-COVID CLABSI. Real-time case reviews identified changes in nurse staffing, increased nurse: patient ratios, delays in routine central line dressing changes, and inconsistent use of alcohol-impregnated port protectors as possible contributing factors.

Conclusion We observed a dramatically higher rate of CLABSI in patients with COVID-19 in 2020, while the rate of CLABSI in patients without COVID-19 remained unchanged from the year prior. Higher rates of ICU admission, critical illness, increased numbers of lumens, increased presence of arterial lines, nurse staffing changes, and gaps in routine line prevention processes associated with emergency measures in the COVID-19 cohort ICU may have contributed to this finding.

A challenge of this novel coronavirus has been discovering and preventing its indiscriminate and catastrophic effect on other organs. We present a rare case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus precipitating fulminant hepatic failure in a patient without respiratory symptoms or prior evidence of liver disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60 year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation, emphysema, and renal cell carcinoma status post left radical nephrectomy presented with weakness and fatigue. On day 12 of admission, she became hemodynamically unstable due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring electrical cardioversion, emergent intubation and transfer to ICU. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was positive, although negative on admission. Dexamethasone, vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were initiated, and one dose of Remdesivir was given after an unremarkable liver panel. No further Remdesivir was given, as six hours later, the patient had abrupt worsening of her liver function tests, with eventual peak AST of 2610 IU/L, ALT of 14860 IU/L and INR of 9.12. Fibrinogen was 136 mg/dL, ammonia 290 mcmol/L, lactate 11.51 mmol/L and IL-6 143.9 pg/mL. Viral causes for acute hepatitis were negative and abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. The patient was treated with N-acetylcysteine, methylprednisolone, lactulose and rifaximin. She was ineligible for transfer to a liver transplant center due to her COVID-19 positive status. Unfortunately, despite conservative management, patient expired after developing severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and refractory septic shock. DISCUSSION: In recent literature, SARS-CoV-2 has primarily been recognized for causing mild liver injury, while fulminant hepatic failure is a rare occurrence (1,2). Remdesivir, which this patient received only one dose of, is known to cause mild transaminitis. It has been shown to cause severe liver injury only when used in combination with amiodarone, due to the latter's role as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein (3). This patient did not have exposure to hepatotoxic agents, prolonged state of shock, evidence of metastatic liver lesions or acute viral hepatitis to explain profound liver failure. Hence, we postulate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have directly targeted the hepatobiliary cells. Further studies of the pathophysiology of liver injury from this virus may allow better prevention and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding SARS-CoV-2's effects on a hepatocellular level may allow for anticipatory monitoring and prevention of liver damage from this virus. For those more severely affected, better treatments would help avoid the difficult course of emergency liver transplantation and resultant need for lifelong immunosuppression.

Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases. This is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination. DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules. Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for achieving the full clinical potential of viral-vectored vaccines. This chapter will present the evolution of vaccines from live or attenuated first-generation agents to recombinant DNA and viral-vectored vaccines. Particular emphasis will be given to human adenovirus (Ad) for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Ad biological properties related to vaccine development will be highlighted along with their advantages and potential hurdles to be overcome. In particular, we will discuss (1) genetic modifications in the Ad capsid protein to reduce the intrinsic viral immunogenicity, (2) antigen capsid incorporation for effective presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system, (3) modification of the hexon and fiber capsid proteins for Ad liver de-targeting and selective retargeting to cancer cells, (4) Ad-based vaccines carrying arming transgenes with immunostimulatory functions as immune adjuvants, and (5) oncolytic Ad vectors as a new therapeutic approach against cancer. Finally, the combination of adenoviral vectors with other non-adenoviral vector systems, the prime/boost strategy of immunization, clinical trials involving Ad-based vaccines, and the perspectives for the field development will be discussed.","output":"Adenovirus-Based Vectors for the Development of Prophylactic and Therapeutic Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Normal myeloid cells of monocytic and granulocytic origin express the metallopeptidase cluster of differentiation 13 (CD13) on the surface just as leukemic blasts in most acute myeloid leukemias (AML).

To study this difference in CD13 surface expression, specific CD13 mRNA from 44 individuals were quantified by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Absolute values for CD13 transcripts were normalised against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript levels to control for variations in sample preparation and mRNA degradation. By correlating normalised CD13 transcript levels and CD13 surface expression, a subgroup of AML patients was identified, having simultaneous diminished levels of myeloid CD13 transcripts and surface expression of the corresponding antigen. For this subgroup we suggest CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) gene expression to be restricted primarily by limited amounts of transcripts. For the majority of AML patients determinants in addition to transcript levels must be involved in regulating CD13/APN gene expression.","output":"Identification of acute myeloid leukemia patients with diminished expression of CD13 myeloid transcripts by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after hospital discharge. OBJECTIVE: To describe the home health recovery of patients with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort.

MEASUREMENTS: Covariates and outcomes were obtained from the mandated OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. RESULTS: After an average of 32 days in HHC, 94% of patients were discharged and most achieved statistically significant improvements in symptoms and function. Activity-of-daily-living dependencies decreased from an average of 6 (95% CI, 5.9 to 6.1) to 1.2 (CI, 1.1 to 1.3). Risk for rehospitalization or death was higher for male patients (HR, 1.45 [CI, 1.04 to 2.03]); White patients (HR, 1.74 [CI, 1.22 to 2.47]); and patients with heart failure (HR, 2.12 [CI, 1.41 to 3.19]), diabetes with complications (HR, 1.71 [CI, 1.17 to 2.52]), 2 or more emergency department visits in the past 6 months (HR, 1.78 [CI, 1.21 to 2.62]), pain daily or all the time (HR, 1.46 [CI, 1.05 to 2.05]), cognitive impairment (HR, 1.49 [CI, 1.04 to 2.13]), or functional dependencies (HR, 1.09 [CI, 1.00 to 1.20]).

A key mutation from a hydrophobic residue in the SARS-CoV sequence to Lys417 in SARS-CoV-2 creates a salt bridge across the central hydrophobic contact region, which along with polar residue mutations results in greater electrostatic complementarity than that of the SARS-CoV complex. Furthermore, both electrostatic effects and enhanced hydrophobic packing due to removal of four out of five proline residues in a short 12-residue loop lead to conformation shift toward a more tilted binding groove in the complex in comparison with the SARS-CoV complex.

Here, non-contact vibration experiments are conducted on an assortment of dry bone segments from the largest cranial bone regions (parietal, frontal, occipital, and temporal) to estimate the first handful of modal frequencies and damping ratios, as well as mode shapes, in the audio frequency regime. Numerical models that consider the cortical tables and the diplo? as domains with separate isotropic material properties are constructed for each bone segment using a routine that identifies the cortical table-diplo? boundaries from micro-computed tomography scan images, and reconstructs a three-dimensional geometry layer by layer. The material properties for cortical tables and diplo? are obtained using a Hounsfield Unit-based mass density calculation combined with a parameter identification scheme for Young's modulus estimation. With the identified parameters, the average error between experimental and numerical modal frequencies is 1.3% and the modal assurance criterion values for most modes are above 0.90, indicating that the layered model is suitable for predicting the vibrational behavior of cranial bone. The proposed layered modeling and identified elastic parameters are also useful to support computational modeling of cranial guided waves and mode conversion in medical ultrasound.

The B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in Mexico during December 2020, showing a slow progressive increase in its circulation frequency, which reached its maximum in May 2021 but never became predominant. In this work, we analyzed the patterns of diversity and distribution of this lineage in Mexico using phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses. Despite the reported increase in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 lineage, in most Mexican states, it did not displace cocirculating lineages, such as B.1.1.519, which dominated the country from February to May 2021. Our results show that the states with the highest prevalence of B.1.1.7 were those at the Mexico-U.S. border.

Similarly, the overall resilience of earthquake monitoring in the United States and around the globe benefits from the NEIC's role as the national center for the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). Here, we highlight significant adaptations the NEIC has made in the face of crises. We discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents the most significant operational crisis to impact the NEIC. The NEIC has maintained continuous operations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by shifting from a fully onsite operations center to a distributed hybrid of onsite and telework staffing. We then discuss cases in which the NEIC has supported regional monitoring in the face of significant crises. In 2018, the NEIC assisted the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory with the Kilauea volcano eruption by responding to large events, implementing contingency monitoring procedures, and calculating moment magnitudes for the low-frequency caldera collapses. Impacts of a crisis extend beyond the immediate response and often require a significant postevent assessment and a rebuilding phase. After the 2017 Hurricane Maria, the NEIC, the USGS National Strong-Motion Program, and the USGS Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory worked with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network and the Puerto Rico Strong-Motion program to assess, plan, and implement upgrades at sites that experienced storm damage.","output":"Seismic Monitoring during Crises at the NEIC in Support of the ANSS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eight cases of psittacosis due to Chlamydia psittaci were identified in May 2013 among 15 individuals involved in chicken gutting activities on a mixed poultry farm in France. All cases were women between 42 and 67 years-old. Cases were diagnosed by serology and PCR of respiratory samples. Appropriate treatment was immediately administered to the eight hospitalised individuals after exposure to birds had been discovered. In the chicken flocks, mainly C. gallinacea was detected, a new member of the family Chlamydiaceae, whereas the ducks were found to harbour predominantly C. psittaci, the classical agent of psittacosis. In addition, C. psittaci was found in the same flock as the chickens that the patients had slaughtered. Both human and C. psittaci-positive avian samples carried the same ompA genotype E/B of C. psittaci, which is widespread among French duck flocks. Repeated grassland rotations between duck and chicken flocks on the farm may explain the presence of C. psittaci in the chickens. Inspection by the veterinary service led to temporary closure of the farm. All birds had to be euthanised on site as no slaughterhouses accepted processing them.

Bile acids are active factors in intestines and influence the replication of enteric viruses. Currently, the role of bile acids on PDCoV replication is unknown. In this study, we tested the effects of different types of bile acids on the replication of PDCoV in cell culture. We found that physiological concentrations of bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) had antiviral activity against PDCoV in porcine kidney cell line (LLC-PK1) and porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA and LCA inhibited PDCoV replication at post-entry stages by inducing the production of interferon (IFN)-3 and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In summary, bile acids CDCA and LCA restricted PDCoV infection and LCA functioned through a GPCR-IFN-3-ISG15 signaling axis in IPEC-J2 cells.

OBJECTIVE To compare note quality between two different templates using a novel randomized clinical simulation process. DESIGN A randomized non-blinded controlled trial of a standard note template versus redesigned template. PARTICIPANTS PGY 1-3 IM residents. INTERVENTIONS Residents documented the simulated patient encounter using one of two templates. The standard template was modeled after the usual outpatient progress note. The new template placed the assessment and plan section in the beginning, grouped subjective data into the assessment, and deemphasized less useful elements. MAIN MEASURES Note length; time to note completion; note template evaluation by resident authors; note evaluation by faculty reviewers. KEY RESULTS 36 residents participated, 19 randomized to standard template, 17 to new. New template generated shorter notes (103 vs 285 lines, p < 0.001) that took the same time to complete (19.8 vs 21.6 min, p = 0.654). Using a 5-point Likert scale, residents considered new notes to have increased visual appeal (4 vs 3, p = 0.05) and less redundancy and clutter (4 vs 3, p = 0.006). Overall template satisfaction was not statistically different. Faculty reviewers rated the standard note more up-to-date (4.3 vs 2.7, p = 0.001), accurate (3.9 vs 2.6, p = 0.003), and useful (4 vs 2.8, p = 0.002), but less organized (3.3 vs 4.5, p < 0.001). Total quality was not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS Residents rated the new note template more visually appealing, shorter, and less cluttered. Faculty reviewers rated both note types equivalent in the overall quality but rated new notes inferior in terms of accuracy and usefulness though better organized. This study demonstrates a novel method of a simulated clinical encounter to evaluate note templates before the introduction into practice.

We evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared them with the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Characteristics of intubated patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were compared with the patients who failed to be extubated or died in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and assess the possible predictors of the disease severity leading to VDAHRF. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. The first 129 patients (18 years or older) with COVID-19 admitted to Monmouth Medical Center from March 1st to April 25th, 2020 were included. RESULTS: Out of 129 patients, 23.25% (n = 30) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and of those, six patients were successfully weaned from the ventilator. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed increased odds of intubation associated with hypoxemia (odds ratio 17.23, 95% CI 5.206-57.088; p < 0.0001), elevated d-dimer by one unit mg/L of FEU (odds ratio 1.515, 95% CI 5.206-57.088; p = 0.0430) and elevated ferritin by one unit ng/ml (odds ratio 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.001, p = 0.0051) on admission, adjusted for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have older age, male gender, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and obesity. The patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were more likely to be younger in age, and none of them had heart failure or CAD.","output":"COVID-19 patients in a tertiary US hospital: Assessment of clinical course and predictors of the disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical preventive services play an important role in preventing deaths, and Healthy People 2020 has set national goals for using clinical preventive services to improve population health (1). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires many health plans to cover certain recommended clinical preventive services without cost-sharing when provided in-network (covered clinical preventive services).* To ascertain prevalence of the use of selected recommended clinical preventive services among persons aged 18 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based annual nationwide survey conducted via landline and mobile phones in the United States, for 10 clinical preventive services covered in-network with no cost-sharing pursuant to the ACA. The weighted prevalence of colon, cervical, and breast cancer screening, pneumococcal and tetanus vaccination, and diabetes screening ranged from 66.0% to 79.2%; the prevalence of the other four clinical preventive services were <50%: 16.5% for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, 26.6% for zoster (shingles) vaccination, 33.2% for influenza vaccination, and 45.8% for HIV testing. Prevalence of HIV testing had the widest variation (3.1-fold differences) across states among the 10 services included in this report. The prevalence of use of clinical preventive services varied by insurance status, income level, and rurality, findings that are consistent with previous studies (2-6). The use of nine of the 10 services examined was lower among the uninsured, those with lower income, and those living in rural communities. Among those factors examined, insurance status was the dominant factor strongly associated with use of clinical preventive services, followed by income-level and rurality. Understanding factors influencing use of recommended clinical preventive services can potentially help decision makers better identify policies to increase their use including strategies to increase insurance coverage.","output":"Use of Selected Recommended Clinical Preventive Services - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 57 million people have been confirmed to have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide.

DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu. METHODS: Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study. The heterogeneity of meta-analysis results ranged from 0% to 90.5%. The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8%C70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8%C71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1%C78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis. The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7%C48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions was 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1%C67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions was 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8%C72.2%).

In the present work, we put forward the first wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pan-demic preparedness. A three-month data of Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP) was generated for the world heritage city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. In this expedition, one hundred sixteen wastewater samples were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, from September 3rd to November 26th, 2020. A total of 111 samples were detected with at least two out of three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, ORF 1ab, and S). Monthly variation depicted a significant decline in all three genes copies in October compared to September 2020, followed by a sharp increment in November 2020. Correspondingly, the descending order of average genome concentration was: November (~10729 copies/ L) > September (~3047 copies/ L) > October (~454 copies/ L). Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 19.3% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovery rate of patients was 16.61, 19.31, and 15.58% in September, October, and Novem-ber 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the genome concentration was observed in the lead of 1-2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases.

Routine rhinology surgery under general anaesthetic (GA) is now faced with significant challenges which include limited theatre capacity, the negative ramifications of surgical prioritization, reduced patient throughput in secondary care, and additional personal protective equipment requirements. Delayed surgery in rhinology, particularly with regards to chronic rhinosinusitis, has previously been shown to have poorer surgical outcomes, a detrimental effect on quality of life and long-term negative health socio-economic effects. Awake rhinology surgery under local anaesthetic (LA) provides an ideal alternative to GA. It provides a means of operating on patients in a setting alternative to currently oversubscribed main theatres, by utilizing satellite facilities, while ensuring identical surgical outcomes for patients who may otherwise have been forced to wait a long time for their procedure. It also confers additional benefits in terms of shorter recovery time and hospital stay for patients. OBJECTIVES: We have developed a set of recommendations that are intended to help support clinicians and managers to better adopt LA rhinology protocols and minimize the risk to the patient and health-care professionals involved. METHODOLOGY: International roundtable forums were conducted and supplemented by individual interviews. The international board consisted of 12 rhinologists experienced in awake rhinology surgery. Feedback was analysed and shared to develop a consensus of best practice. RECOMMENDATIONS: Local and national guidelines need to be adhered to with specific focus on patient and clinician safety. When performing awake rhinology procedures in the COVID-19 recovery process, consider implementing specific safety measures and workflow practices to safeguard patients and staff and minimize the risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Awake surgery potentially provides quicker access to routine rhinology surgery in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase, ensuring patients are treated in a timely matter, thereby avoiding higher downstream costs, and improving outcomes.","output":"Awake Rhinology Surgery in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an accurate user-encounter trace generator based on analytical models.

We prospectively assessed the feasibility of perioperative GERICO for older adults with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study wherein all patients 75 years and older undergoing radical cystectomy between October 2019 and November 2020 were referred to the Geriatric Service preoperatively. Feasibility was defined according to the percentage of patients who received preoperative evaluation by the Geriatrics Service, who were followed for more than 80% of their inpatient days and who had their surgery rescheduled for logistical reasons. Urology advanced practice provider (APP) satisfaction with the program was measured via an 11-item survey. RESULTS: Sixty-six eligible patients underwent radical cystectomy in the stated time frame; 59 (89%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 79-97%) were referred to the Geriatric Service for evaluation. The median age of patients who had geriatric comanagement was 79 years; 40 (68%) were male. Forty-one patients (69%) were visited on at least 80% of the days in which they were not in the intensive care unit. No surgeries were rescheduled for logistical reasons. Nine of the 12 urology APPs (75%) responded to the survey; all nine \\"somewhat\\" or \\"strongly\\" agreed with statements indicating satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSION: Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we showed that perioperative GERICO is feasible.

We hypothesized that patients in the BCP have diminished cerebral blood flow autoregulation than those who undergo surgery in the lateral decubitus position (LDP). A secondary aim was to examine whether there is a relationship between patient positioning during surgery and postoperative cognition or serum brain injury biomarker levels. METHODS Patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP (n = 109) or LDP (n = 109) had mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy. A continuous, moving Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between MAP and rScO2, generating the variable cerebral oximetry index (COx). When MAP is in the autoregulated range, COx approaches zero because there is no correlation between cerebral blood flow and arterial blood pressure. In contrast, when MAP is below the limit of autoregulation, COx is higher because there is a direct relationship between lower arterial blood pressure and lower cerebral blood flow. Thus, diminished autoregulation would be manifest as higher COx. Psychometric testing was performed before surgery and then 7 to 10 days and 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. A composite cognitive outcome was determined as the Z-score. Serum S100, neuron-specific enolase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were measured at baseline, after surgery, and on postoperative day 1. RESULTS After adjusting for age and history of hypertension, COx (P = 0.035) was higher and rScO2 lower (P < 0.0001) in the BCP group than in the LDP group. After adjusting for baseline composite cognitive outcome, there was no difference in Z-score 7 to 10 days (P = 0.530) or 4 to 6 weeks (P = 0.202) after surgery between the BCP and the LDP groups. There was no difference in serum biomarker levels between the 2 position groups CONCLUSIONS : Compared with patients in the LDP, patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP are more likely to have higher COx indicating diminished cerebral autoregulation and lower rScO2. There were no differences in the composite cognitive outcome between the BCP and the LDP groups after surgery after accounting for baseline Z-score.","output":"Shoulder surgery in the beach chair position is associated with diminished cerebral autoregulation but no differences in postoperative cognition or brain injury biomarker levels compared with supine positioning: the anesthesia patient safety foundation beach chair study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to examine media coverage of COVID-19 and the resistance of the Indonesian people. This research is a legal sociology study that discusses the public's response to government policies regarding the Covid-19 vaccine with an Islamic legal approach. The data is analyzed using critical discourse analysis. This study concludes that community resistance to vaccines has a relationship with online media content. News content of victims who died after the vaccine, information about vaccines that impact the human body to become sick in the long term, and information about raw materials or contents of the Covid-19 vaccine that are not halal, indirectly have implications for the community resistance. This refusal was mainly due to information about victims who had been vaccinated experienced vaccine failures, especially from social media such as YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook, which are sometimes difficult to justify. According to Islamic law, people should be careful about content and news regarding Covid-19 because it may not be accurate. Therefore, the government needs to provide solutions in various ways. First, the government oversees all social media in conveying information so that all news related to the COVID-19 vaccine needs to be more careful and wisely not to worry the public. Second, the government needs to re-strengthen media regulations or news coverage that doesn't seem to work optimally. Moreover, the government's vaccine policy aims to prevent the danger of the virus, which guarantees the safety of people's lives, and it is part of maqashid al-syari'ah.

The research on consumer bankruptcy prediction is of paramount importance as it aims to build statistical models that can identify consumers in a difficult financial situation that may lead to consumer bankruptcy. In the face of the current global pandemic crisis, the future of household finances is uncertain. The change of the macroeconomic and microeconomic situation of households requires searching for better and more precise methods. The research relies on four samples of households: two learning samples (imbalanced and balanced) and two testing samples (imbalanced and balanced) from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) which was conducted in the United States. The results show that the predictive performance of the logit model based on a balanced sample is more effective compared to the one based on an imbalanced sample. Furthermore, mortgage debt to assets ratio, age, being married, having credit constraints, payday loans or payments more than 60 days past due in the last year appear to be predictors of consumer bankruptcy which increase the risk of becoming bankrupt. Moreover, both the ratio of credit card debt to overall debt and owning a house decrease the risk of going bankrupt.","output":"Consumer Bankruptcy Prediction Using Balanced and Imbalanced Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound is a diagnostic adjunct in the management of respiratory diseases. We describe the clinical progress and lung ultrasound findings of a Singaporean COVID-19 intensive care unit patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Methods: The clinical course of one COVID-19 patient managed in the intensive care unit was traced. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 virus infection and intubated after developing respiratory failure. Serial point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound was performed by the managing intensivist daily, and correlated with the clinical progress and chest X-ray imaging done for the patient. Results: The patient exhibited lung ultrasound findings consistent with that described for viral pneumonias. This included numerous B-lines and subpleural consolidations with disrupted pleural lines distributed symmetrically, predominantly in bilateral upper BLUE points, and lower BLUE points bilaterally. Coalescing B-lines leading on to the development of bilateral white lung were associated with worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome. An increased density or reduction of the B-lines was associated with clinical improvement or deterioration, respectively. Conclusions: Trained clinicians, who are familiar with point-of-care lung ultrasonography, may consider point-of-care bedside ultrasound as an important adjunct to history and physical examination for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 when advanced imaging is not available because of logistical reasons or infectious control. This applies in particular to cases where resources are limited, and patient transfers to facilities offering such services may prove hazardous.","output":"Lung ultrasound in a singapore covid-19 intensive care unit patient and a review of its potential clinical utility in pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) is a gold-standard tool for assessing cognitive functioning in individuals with severe mental illness. This study is an initial examination of the validity of remote administration of 4 MCCB tests measuring processing speed (Trail Making Test: Part A, Animal Fluency), working memory (Letter-Number Span), and verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised). We conducted analyses on individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SCZ), as well as healthy volunteers, who were assessed in-person (BD = 80, SCZ = 116, HV = 14) vs. remotely (BD = 93, SCZ = 43, HV = 30) to determine if there were significant differences in performance based on administration format. Additional analyses tested whether remote and in-person assessment performance was similarly correlated with symptom severity, cognitive and social cognitive performance, and functional outcomes. Individuals with BD performed significantly better than those with SCZ on all MCCB subtests across administration format. Animal Fluency did not differ by administration format, but remote participants performed significantly worse on Trail Making and HVLT-R. On the Letter-Number Span task, individuals with bipolar disorder performed significantly better when participating remotely. Finally, patterns of correlations with related constructs were largely similar between administration formats. Thus, results suggest that remote administration of some of the MCCB subtests may be a valid alternative to in-person testing, but more research is necessary to determine why some tasks were affected by administration format.","output":"Validity of remote administration of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery for individuals with severe mental illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: High systolic blood pressure (HSBP) remains the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide; however, limited data have revealed all-cause and cause-specific burdens attributed to HSBP at global and regional levels. This study aimed to estimate the global burden and priority diseases attributable to HSBP by region, sex, and age. Methods: Based on data and evaluation methods from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, we estimated trends of age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), the age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years (ASDRs), and the age-standardized rate of years lived with disability (ASYRs) attributable to HSBP during 1990-2019. Further, we analyzed cause-specific burdens attributable to HSBP by sex, age, year, and region. Results: Globally, a significant downtrend was found in the ASMR attributed to HSBP while ASYRs did not change substantially during 1990-2019. The majority of HSBP burden has shifted from high-middle sociodemographic index (SDI) regions to lower SDI regions. All-cause and most cause-specific burdens related to HSBP were improved in high SDI regions but the downtrends have stagnated in recent years. Although many cause-specific deaths associated with HSBP declined, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and endocarditis associated deaths were aggravated globally and ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation and flutter, aortic aneurysm (AA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) associated deaths were on the rise in low/low-middle/middle SDI regions. Additionally, males had higher disease burdens than females. Middle-aged people with CVDs composed the major subgroup affected by HSBP while older people had the highest ASMRs associated with HSBP. Conclusions: This study revealed the global burden and priority diseases attributable to HSBP with wide variation by region, sex, and age, calling for effective and targeted strategies to reduce the prevalence and mortality of HSBP, especially in low/low-middle/middle SDI regions.","output":"Heavy Disease Burden of High Systolic Blood Pressure During 1990-2019: Highlighting Regional, Sex, and Age Specific Strategies in Blood Pressure Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid identification of host genes essential for virus replication may expedite the generation of therapeutic interventions.

SARS-CoV-2 replication in IOs does not require the endosomal Cathepsin B/L proteases, but specifically depends on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. Other TMPRSS family members were not essential. The newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV similarly depended on TMPRSS2. These findings underscore the relevance of non-transformed human models for coronavirus research, identify TMPRSS2 as an attractive pan-coronavirus therapeutic target, and demonstrate that an organoid knockout biobank is a valuable tool to investigate the biology of current and future emerging coronaviruses.","output":"A CRISPR/Cas9 genetically engineered organoid biobank reveals essential host factors for coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) increased the demand for critical care spaces and the task for individual countries was to optimise the capacity of their health systems.

Approach and Results: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detected in human megakaryocytes and platelets in COVID-19 patients and following incubation with the virus in vitro. We show a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and megakaryocytes that alters the platelet transcriptome and platelet activity. COVID-19 platelets are hyperreactive and have a distinct transcriptomic profile characteristic of prothrombotic large and immature platelets.

In a cohort of 3,915 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we analyzed blood platelet indices collected at hospital admission. Following adjustment for demographics, clinical risk factors, medication use, and biomarkers of inflammation and thrombosis, platelet count, size, and immaturity are each associated with increased critical illness and all-cause mortality.

Intranasal instillation of AAV6.2FF-hACE2 resulted in robust hACE2 expression in the respiratory tract. pS induced robust cellular and humoral responses. Vaccinated animals were challenged with 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) and euthanized four days post-challenge to assess viral load. One immunization resulted in 50% protection and two immunizations were completely protective. Overall, the AAV6.2FF-hACE2 mouse transduction model represents an easily accessible, genetically diverse mouse model for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection and preclinical evaluation of potential interventions.","output":"A novel mouse AAV6 hACE2 transduction model of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection studied using synDNA immunogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The BioFire?

Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. METHODS: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. RESULTS: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at >30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohens kappa varied between 0.86-0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM <14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG 14 days. CONCLUSION: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV <14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM improves clinical sensitivity early in disease course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) causes high amounts of morbidity and mortality worldwide every year. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major pathogen of ARTIs in children. In this study, we aimed to investigate the epidemiology and genotypic diversity of HMPV in children hospitalized with ARTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Hospitalized children aged < 14 years with ARTIs were enrolled from April 2017 to March 2018; nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped based on a partial N gene. Whole genome sequences were determined for samples with high viral loads. RESULTS: 4.08% (52/1276) enrolled paediatric patients were identified as having HMPV infection. The epidemic season is winter and early spring, children aged &#8804; 4 years were more susceptible to HMPV infection (47/52, 90.38%). The co-infection rate were 36.54% (19/52), the most common co-infected virus were influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The main diagnoses of HMPV infection were pneumonia (29/52, 55.77%) and bronchitis (23/52, 44.23%), while the main clinical manifestations were cough, fever, rhinorrhoea, and sneeze. Among 48 HMPV-positive specimens, A2b (19/48, 39.58%) and B1 (26/48, 54.17%) were the main epidemic subtypes. Patients with HMPV genotype A infection had a higher viral load compared to genotype B patients (6.07 vs. 5.37 log10 RNA copies/ml). Five complete sequences of HMPV were obtained. This is the first report of a whole genome sequence of HMPV-B1 isolated in China. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in paediatric patients. Cases of HMPV infection could burden hospitals in the epidemic season.

However, specificity might be poor in the absence of a clinical and epidemiological context. The goal of this work was to systematically evaluate two novel CT features (sharp margin and geographic shape) of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: All patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction proven COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT between March first and April 15, 2020 were retrospectively identified from two tertiary care hospitals in Germany. The CTs were evaluated regarding the presence of typical CT signs (e.g. ground glass opacitiy, consolidation, crazy paving). Moreover, the shape of the opacifications (round, geographic, curvilinear) and their margin (unsharp, sharp) was determined. RESULTS: The study population comprised 108 patients (64 male) with a mean age of 59.6 years. Ground glass opacities (96%) and consolidation (75%) were the most prevalent CT signs. Crazy paving was seen in 17%, bronchial dilatation in 21%, air bronchogram in 29%, vessel enlargement in 47%, cavitation in 0%, lymphadenopathy in 32%, pleural effusion in 16%. Round configuration of densities was present in 41% of CTs, geographic shape in 27% and curvilinear opacities in 44%. 79% of opacifications were at least partially sharply marginated. In almost all cases, the lung was affected bilaterally (94%). CONCLUSION: The CT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in a cohort from Germany was in accordance with prior studies. However, we identified two novel CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia which have so far not been systematically evaluated. A sharp border and geographic shape of opacifications were frequently observed.

We aim to assess the outcome of COVID-19 infection in MS patients receiving DMTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 45 COVID-19-infected patients previously diagnosed with MS. The data regarding their MS status and the type of DMT taken by the patients were extracted from the Isfahan MS Institute registry and were summarized. Diagnosis of MS was based on the 2017 McDonald Criteria, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on computed tomography scan and polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Out of the 45 MS patients infected with COVID-19, 5 had unfavorable outcomes. Two patients deceased and the other three had persistent respiratory complications on the 4-week follow-up visit. Hypertension, diabetes, seizures, and rheumatoid arthritis were among the comorbidities that the patients reported. Both patients who died received rituximab as part of their MS treatment. All other patients recovered completely. CONCLUSION: Each different drug category may possess a distinct risk for infection, therefore until robust evidence are available, the safest drug should be utilized or the therapy should be postponed, if possible, to minimize patient risk.

Comprehensive analysis of such data could pave the way for development of efficient vaccines and effective drugs. In the current study, we obtained high-throughput gene expression data associated with human lung epithelial cells infected with respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS, H1N1, avian influenza, rhinovirus and Dhori, then performed comparative transcriptome analysis to identify SARS-CoV-2 exclusive genes. The analysis yielded seven SARS-CoV-2 specific genes including CSF2 [GM-CSF] (colony-stimulating factor 2) and calcium-binding proteins (such as S100A8 and S100A9), which are known to be involved in respiratory diseases. The analyses showed that genes involved in inflammation are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, results of proteinCprotein interaction analyses were consistent with a functional role of CSF2 and S100A9 in COVID-19 disease.

We assessed the effects of COVID-19-related changes on take-home methadone dosing in two OTPs serving five rural Oregon counties. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods convergent design. The OTPs extracted urine drug test (UDT) results, take-home methadone regimens, and treatment retention from the electronic health record (EHR) for patients (n = 377). A mixed-effects negative binomial regression model assessed patient-level differences in take-home doses before and after the COVID-19 policy changes and the associations with treatment discontinuation, and UDT positivity. Semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 32) explored patient reactions to increased take-home dosing and reduced clinic visits to provide context for quantitative findings. RESULTS: The number of take-home doses increased in the post-COVID-19 period for patients engaged in treatment for more than 180 days (median: 8 vs 13 take-home doses per month, p = 0.011). Take-homes did not increase for patients with fewer days of treatment. Each percentage point increase in take-home dosing above what would be expected without COVID-19 policy changes was negatively associated with the percent of UDT positive for opioids (B = ?0.12, CI [?0.21, ?0.04], p = 0.005) and the probability of treatment discontinuation (aOR = 0.97, CI [0.95, 0.99], p = 0.003).

The spikes, which are composed of three E2 and E1 glycoprotein heterodimers, are responsible for receptor binding and mediating fusion between the viral and host-cell membranes during entry. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of E2 interacts with the nucleocapsid core during the last stages of particle assembly, possibly to aid in particle stability. During assembly, the spikes are nonfusogenic until the E3 glycoprotein is cleaved from E2 in the trans-Golgi network. Thus, a mutation in E2 potentially has effects on virus entry, spike assembly, or spike maturation. E2 is a highly conserved, cysteine-rich transmembrane glycoprotein. We made single cysteine-to-serine mutations within two distinct regions of the E2 ectodomain in both Sindbis virus and Ross River virus. Each of the E2 Cys mutants produced fewer infectious particles than wild-type virus. Further characterization of the mutant viruses revealed differences in particle morphology, fusion activity, and polyprotein cleavage between Sindbis and Ross River virus mutants, despite the mutations being made at corresponding positions in E2. The nonconserved assembly defects suggest that E2 folding and function is species dependent, possibly due to interactions with a virus-specific chaperone.","output":"Mutating conserved cysteines in the alphavirus e2 glycoprotein causes virus-specific assembly defects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease, which became a global threat to public health. Specific subsets of the population are more vulnerable, namely those with chronic diseases. We aimed to estimate the share of the Portuguese population at the highest risk for complications following COVID-19 infection due to both old age and specific comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our sample included all people aged 65 years and above (2215 men and 3486 women) who participated in the fifth Portuguese National Health Interview Survey, conducted in 2014. In order to project the potential population at highest risk for COVID-19, we used the latest available official demographic estimates from the National Institute of Statistics - INE 2018. We used a more restrictive definition of risk combining old age criteria and the following chronic conditions as potential risk factors for COVID-19 according to the available literature: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS We estimated that 15.5% (n = 1 560 667) of the Portuguese population might be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 because of old age and existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country (from 1.7% in Azores to 33.7% in Northern Portugal). Northern Portugal not only has the highest prevalence of selected morbidity (72.8%) within mainland Portugal, but also has the largest population at risk for COVID-19 (n = 526 607). This was followed by the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region (n = 408 564) and Central Portugal (n = 388 867). DISCUSSION Our results should encourage authorities to continue protecting those more vulnerable to the pandemic threat, particularly on those areas of the country which are more likely to be further affected. CONCLUSION We projected a considerable number of Portuguese people at the highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to both old age and pre-existing chronic conditions.

It is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic and the immune system. In this study we aimed to evaluate the different inflammatory markers and indexes of systemic inflammatory response in predicting the mortality in patients with COVID 19. Methods In this cross sectional study, various inflammatory markers like D-dimer, CRP, serum ferritin, LDH and CBC derived indexes of inflammation were analyzed in predicting mortality in COVID 19 infection. Results We enrolled 302 COVID 19 patients who had a mean age of 54.51 yrs with 210 (69.5%) males. Among them 21% were asymptomatic and fever was the commonest among symptomatic patients. Majority of patients (66.7%) had no comorbidities and 20% had multiple comorbidities. On analyzing different hematological variables, survivors had statistically significant higher hemoglobin count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophil and platelet count and lower leukocyte, neutrophil count. Inflammatory markers D-dimer, serum ferritin and LDH were significantly elevated among non survivors. Among the indexes of inflammation, only NLR showed significant higher values among non survivors. All the inflammatory markers were able to predict mortality among the COVID 19 infected cases with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 65% for d dimer levels, 85% and 72% for serum ferritin, 85% and 72% for LDH, 85% and 51% for CRP levels respectively.

Recently, as public tolerance for isolation abated, CDC guidance on duration of at-home isolation of COVID-19 cases was shortened to five days if no symptoms, with no lab test requirement, despite more cautious approaches advocated by other federal experts. MethodsWe conducted a decision tree analysis of alternative protocols for ending COVID-19 isolation, estimating net costs (direct and productivity), secondary infections, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of input uncertainty. ResultsPer 100 individuals, five-day isolation had 23 predicted secondary infections and a net cost of $33,000. Symptom check on day five (CDC guidance) yielded a 23% decrease in secondary infections (to 17.8), with a net cost of $45,000. Antigen testing on day six yielded 2.9 secondary infections and $63,000 in net costs. This protocol, compared to the next best protocol of antigen testing on day five of a maximum eight-day isolation, cost an additional $1,300 per secondary infection averted. Antigen or polymerase chain reaction testing on day five were dominated (more expensive and less effective) versus antigen testing on day six. Results were qualitatively robust to uncertainty in key inputs.

METHODS: Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests. CONCLUSION: Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional baseline data on 51 338 community-living women and men aged 45C85 years from the population-based Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (collected from September 2011 to May 2015) were used in this study. PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A Frailty Index (FI) was constructed using self-reported chronic conditions, psychological function and cognitive status and physical functioning variables. Social stratifiers were chosen based on the Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Reporting Initiative, reflecting key health inequalities in Canada. Unadjusted and adjusted FIs and domain-specific FIs (based on chronic conditions, physical function, psychological/cognitive deficits) were examined across population strata. RESULTS: The overall mean FI was 0.130.08. It increased with age and was higher in women than men. Higher mean FIs were found among study participants with low income (0.200.10), who did not complete secondary education (0.170.09) or had low perceived social standing (0.180.10). Values did not differ by Canadian province of residence or urban/rural status. After simultaneously adjusting for population characteristics and other covariates, income explained the most heterogeneity in frailty, especially in younger age groups; similar patterns were found for men and women. The average frailty for people aged 45C54 in the lowest income group was greater than that for those aged 75C85 years. The heterogeneity in the FI among income groups was greatest for the psychological/cognitive domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that especially in the younger age groups, psychological/cognitive deficits are most highly associated with both overall frailty levels and the gradient in frailty associated with income. If this is predictive of later increases in the other two domains (and overall frailty), it raises the question whether targeting mental health factors earlier in life might be an effective approach to mitigating frailty.","output":"Frailty differences across population characteristics associated with health inequality: a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COv-2) is the etiologic agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID19). The majority of infected people presents flu like symptoms and among them 15-20% develops a severe interstitial pneumonitis (IP) that may eventually evolve in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). IP is caused by the viral glycoprotein spike (S) binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of alveolar pneumocytes. The virus is recognized by the \\"pattern recognition receptors\\" (PRR) of the immune cells that release cytokines activating more immune cells that produce a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tissue factors and vasoactive peptides.

In the present study, cardenolide digitoxigenin (DIGI) obtained from a methanolic extract of Digitalis lanata leaves was tested for its antileishmanial activity against Leishmania infantum species. Results showed that 50% Leishmania and murine macrophage inhibitory concentrations (IC(50) and CC(50), respectively) were of 6.9  1.5 and 295.3  14.5 g/mL, respectively. With amphotericin B (AmpB) deoxycholate, used as a control drug, values of 0.13  0.02 and 0.79  0.12 g/mL, respectively, were observed. Selectivity index (SI) values were of 42.8 and 6.1 for DIGI and AmpB, respectively. Preliminary studies suggested that the mechanism of action for DIGI is to cause alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential, to increase the levels of reactive oxygen species and induce accumulation of lipid bodies in the parasites. DIGI was incorporated into Pluronic? F127-based polymeric micelles, and the formula (DIGI/Mic) was used to treat L. infantumCinfected mice. Miltefosine was used as a control drug. Results showed that animals treated with either miltefosine, DIGI, or DIGI/Mic presented significant reductions in the parasite load in their spleens, livers, bone marrows, and draining lymph nodes, as well as the development of a specific Th1-type response, when compared with the controls.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model. Further work to facilitate person-centered abortion information and care can build on initial modifications in response to the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 has shifted clinician perception of risk and has catalyzed a change in clinical protocols for medication abortion.

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).","output":"A novel approach utilizing laser acupuncture teletherapy for management of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last 40 years have seen the development of several antiviral drugs with therapeutic value in treating life-threatening or debilitating diseases such as those caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus, herpesviruses (such as herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus) and influenza virus.

Zakat is an Islamic obligation to donate a portion of ones wealth. This is because the income of the muzakki (the people who pay the zakat) decreased. The pandemic caused the decline of peoples income, thus increasing the number of mustahik (zakat recipients). This condition encourages the application of a zakat empowerment concept that aims to accelerate peoples economy. AIM: This paper aims analyze the zakat empowerment concept in the health and welfare aspects during the pandemic, to obtain legal protection based on the benefit (maslahah) and policy theories. METHODS: This qualitative research aims to focus on the zakat empowerment concept in the aspects of health and welfare during the pandemic. RESULTS: The zakat institutions may channel the zakat to the mustahik who are affected by the pandemic in the form of medicine, COVID-19 vaccines, and capitals to families whose breadwinners lost their jobs or died due to the pandemic. This qualitative research aims to analyze the zakat empowerment concept during the pandemic in the aspects of health and welfare and its legal protection based on benefit (maslahah) theory and the policy theory. According to the policy theory, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic is according to Law No. 23 of 2011 on Zakat Management. CONCLUSION: According to the maslahah theory, it is categorized as a maslahah hajiyah from the basis of maslahah al-mursalah. However, to give legal certainty and legal protection, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic should be validated in legal regulation. ? 2021 Moch Chotib.","output":"Zakat management concept to accelerate health and economic recovery during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acidic pH of tumors profoundly inhibits effector functions of activated CD8 + T-cells. We hypothesize that this is a physiological process in immune regulation, and that it occurs within lymph nodes (LNs), which are likely acidic because of low convective flow and high glucose metabolism. Here we show by in vivo fluorescence and MR imaging, that LN paracortical zones are profoundly acidic. These acidic niches are absent in athymic Nu/Nu and lymphodepleted mice, implicating T-cells in the acidifying process. T-cell glycolysis is inhibited at the low pH observed in LNs. We show that this is due to acid inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), resulting in a negative feedback on glycolytic rate. Importantly, we demonstrate that this acid pH does not hinder initial activation of na?ve T-cells by dendritic cells.

The University of British Columbia (UBC) MD Undergraduate Program (MDUP) is the sixth largest medical school in North America. MDUP students and faculty developed a joint response to these disruptions to address the curriculum and public health challenges that the pandemic posed. After clinical activities were suspended in March 2020, third- and fourth-year MDUP students formed a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team (MSRT) to support frontline physicians, public health agencies, and community members affected by the pandemic. A nimble organizational structure was developed across 4 UBC campuses to ensure a rapid response to meet physician and community needs. Support from the faculty ensured the activities were safe for the public, patients, and students and facilitated the provision of curricular credit for volunteer activities meeting academic criteria. As of June 19, 2020, more than 700 medical students had signed up to participate in 68 projects. The majority of students participated in projects supporting the health care system, including performing contact tracing, staffing public COVID-19 call centers, distributing personal protective equipment, and creating educational multimedia products. Many initiatives have been integrated into the MDUP curriculum as scholarly activities or paraclinical electives for which academic credit is awarded. This was made possible by the inherent flexibility of the MDUP curriculum and a strong existing partnership between students and faculty. Through this process, medical students were able to develop fundamental leadership, advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills, essential competencies for graduating physicians. In developing a transparent, accountable, and inclusive organization, students were able to effectively meet community needs during a crisis and create a sustainable and democratic structure capable of responding to future emergencies.

As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them. METHODS: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets. RESULTS: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping. CONCLUSION: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the incorporation of synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits in a tertiary university-based ophthalmology clinic for low-income and uninsured patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: The records of 18 patients who were due for an in-person visit in the medically underserved patient clinic at our institute were reviewed. Patients considered high risk of ocular morbidity progression were approved to proceed with an in-person visit. Patients with non-urgent visit indications were attempted to be contacted by telephone to be offered a telemedicine telephone visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. RESULTS: Clinical triage by an attending ophthalmologist determined that 17 patients (94.4%, n = 18) had visit indications appropriate for evaluation by telemedicine. Six patients (35.3%, n = 17) were successfully contacted and offered a telemedicine visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. All 6 patients accepted, scheduled, and completed a telemedicine visit. Eleven patients (64.7%, n = 17) were not able to be successfully contacted to offer and schedule either a telemedicine visit or a postponed in-person office visit. Patients who were not able to be successfully contacted were on average younger in age and more likely to be female, Hispanic/Latino, from Latin America, with a preferred language of Spanish.

DESIGN Open-label, Phase 1 clinical pharmacokinetic study SETTING: Research Study Center PATIENTS: Twenty-seven subjects; comprised of 11 individuals with normal hepatic function and eight each with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were included, as classified by Child-Pugh scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULT Subjects were administered a single dose of IV lefamulin 150 mg over 1 hour. Plasma was collected for 48 hours and analyzed for lefamulin and its major metabolite, BC-8041, concentrations in addition to assessing lefamulin plasma protein binding. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared using least square geometric mean ratios. Lefamulin was well tolerated in all hepatic function groups. Statistical analyses revealed reductions in Cmax and increases in renal clearance for Moderate and Severe groups, as well as, increased volume of distribution for the Severe group.

Twenty-two patients were admitted (59.5%); the main reasons for admission included vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) only (n= 6; 27.3%), fever (n= 6; 27.3%), acute chest syndrome (n= 5; 22.7%), and VOC combined with other conditions (n= 4; 18.2%). During hospitalization, 54.1% of the patients received at least one medication, while antibiotics (54.1%), analgesia (32.4%), anticoagulants (16.2%), and steroids (16.2%) were the most commonly administered drugs. The mean length of hospitalization was 7.64.5 days, with only one patient (2.7%) requiring intensive care unit admission and assisted ventilation. Conclusion The overall prognosis was good since only one patient has passed away, while all others recovered and, subsequently, were discharged. Manifestations, laboratory investigations, and management modalities should be utilized promptly to enhance the prognosis and obtain better outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 in Saudi Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Retrospective Multi-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present review covers the list of approved vaccines available in India i.e. Covaxin, Covishield, and Sputnik-V.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered-Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Method: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Result: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a -3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found. Conclusion: This study signifies the effect of climate factors on COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate, but climate factors are not the only variable and several other interlinked factors enhance the spread of COVID-19. Hence, effective mitigation policies, enhancing testing capacities, and developing public attitudes toward adopting precautionary measures are important to overcome this overwhelming pandemic.","output":"Impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 cases and mortalities in major cities of Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication that presents with transient neurologic deficits and is caused by neurotoxicity of intravascular contrast media.

The SCENARIO model is an example of a thermoregulatory model that predicts heat strain including body core temperature (Tc) from individual characteristics, physical activity, clothing properties and environmental conditions. This paper presents work to optimize and enhance the SCENARIO model for prediction of Tc during high intensity load carriage tasks under predominantly tropical climate conditions. Data for model optimization (in-sample analysis) and model external validation were derived from four and two load carriage studies respectively. A total of four parameters characterizing metabolic heat production, sweat evaporation and ice ingestion for hydration were identified for model optimization based on physiological reasoning. The accuracy of Tc estimates was evaluated based on bias, root mean square deviation (RMSD), RMSD based on mean values (RMSD-Mean), and standard deviation fall-in percentage (SDP). Under in-sample analysis, the optimized model achieved bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP of 0.01C, 0.39C, 0.14C and 99%, respectively. When externally validated against two sets of unseen data, the model achieved comparable bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP values of 0.06C, 0.32C, 0.13C, 92% and 0.08C, 0.39C, 0.19C, 92%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate the robustness of the optimized SCENARIO model for predicting the Tc responses during prolonged, high-intensity physical tasks under hot and humid environments.

This result has a two-fold significance. First, it simplifies the computational complexity of the non-Markovian model in practical applications, where only the stationary distribution of the state probabilities is required. Next, it defines the epidemic threshold of the non-Markovian SEIS model, without the necessity of a thrall mathematical analysis.

Some of the likely functions of the domains/complexes include silencing of the donor mating type region in fission yeast, regulation of mammalian imprinted genes and the phylotypic progression during vertebrate development. Far cis- and trans-contacts between micro-phase separated domains/complexes in mammalian nuclei contribute to the emergence of epigenetic compartmental domains (ECDs) detected in Hi-C maps.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently experience delays in acquiring this skillset, demonstrating challenges in the ability and/or propensity to imitate the actions of others. Current intervention programs frequently use discrete trial teaching (DTT) or contingent imitation to support imitation development in young children with ASD. This study combined contingent imitation with DTT to teach imitation to individuals who had previously struggled with acquiring this skill. A multiple probe design across three preschool children with ASD was conducted within participants early learning classrooms. Response to intervention varied across participants, with participants with more advanced imitation skills at study onset demonstrating greater outcomes. Combining contingent imitation with DTT may facilitate the propensity to imitate for individuals who exhibit some appropriate object engagement and are inconsistently imitating others actions with objects.

We sought to assess safety and effectiveness of an optimized logistics for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) pathway developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis. An optimized TAVI logistics based on performing TAVI work-up and procedure during the same hospitalization was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. In-hospital and 30-day outcomes of patients treated during the pandemic were compared with an historical cohort of patients undergoing TAVI with staged work-up before the pandemic within an homogeneous timeframe. RESULTS: Of 536 patients, 227 (42.4%) underwent TAVI during the COVID-19 pandemic with a reduction of 26.5% compared to the pre-pandemic period (n = 309). The median age was 81 (77C85) years and STS score was 3.4 (2.2C5.6)%. Lower rates of in-hospital major vascular complications (2.2% vs. 8.7%; p < 0.01) and life-threatening bleeding (0.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.01) were reported in the COVID-19 period, whereas no difference in acute kidney injury (7.0% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.85) rate was reported between COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. No difference in 30-day rates of all-cause death (4.0 vs. 4.5, p = 0.75) and of major adverse cardiovascular events (4.0 vs. 6.1, p = 0.26) were reported between COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of optimized single-hospitalization logistics for TAVI workup and procedure developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, showed to be as safe and effective as the two-stage TAVI pathway previously adopted, allowing the minimization of potential exposure to COVID-19 infection and shortening times to treatment for severely symptomatic patients.","output":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation during COVID-19 pandemic: An optimized model to relieve healthcare system overload"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Elucidation of the antiproliferative efficacy and mechanism of action of a design-optimized noscapine analogue, N-4-CN. METHODS Cell viability was studied using an MTT assay. The drug-tubulin interactions were investigated using spectrofluorometry. The architectural defects, hyper stabilization, and recovery competence of cellular microtubules were studied using immunofluorescence microscopy. DCF-DH and Rhodamine 123 were used as probes to estimate levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively. Flow cytometry revealed the cell cycle progression pattern of the drug-treated cells. KEY FINDINGS Among the cell lines tested, N-4-CN showed the strongest inhibition of the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 , 2.7  0.1 M) and weakest inhibition of the non-cancerous epithelial cell line, VERO (IC50 , 60.2  3 M). It perturbed tertiary structure of tubulin and stabilized colchicine binding to the protein. In cells, N-4-CN hyper-stabilized the microtubules, and prevented the recovery of cold-depolymerized microtubules. Its multitude of effects on tubulin and microtubules facilitated cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death that were complemented by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). SIGNIFICANCE Owing to its ability to perturb a well-defined cancer drug target, tubulin, and to promote ROS-facilitated apoptosis, N-4-CN could be investigated further as a potential therapeutic against many neoplasms, including TNBC.","output":"Induction of microtubule hyper stabilization and robust G2 /M arrest by N-4-CN in human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I present a stage-theoretical interpretation of the supervaluationist semantics for the growing-block theory of time according to which the nodes on the branching tree of historical possibilities are taken to be possible stages of the growth of the growing-block.

Whether this benefit is exclusive to stent retrievers is unclear. METHODS THERAPY (The Randomized, Concurrent Controlled Trial to Assess the Penumbra System's Safety and Effectiveness in the Treatment of Acute Stroke; NCT01429350) was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1), open label, blinded end point evaluation, concurrent controlled clinical trial of aspiration thrombectomy after intravenous alteplase (IAT) administration compared with intravenous-alteplase alone in patients with large vessel ischemic stroke because of a thrombus length of 8 mm. The primary efficacy end point was the percent of patients achieving independence at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2; intention-to-treat analysis). The primary safety end point was the rate of severe adverse events (SAEs) by 90 days (as treated analysis). Patients were randomized 1:1 across 36 centers in 2 countries (United States and Germany). RESULTS Enrollment was halted after 108 (55 IAT and 53 intravenous) patients (of 692 planned) because of external evidence of the added benefit of endovascular therapy to intravenous-alteplase alone. Functional independence was achieved in 38% IAT and 30% intravenous intention-to-treat groups (P=0.52). Intention-to-treat ordinal modified Rankin Scale odds ratio was 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-3.59; P=0.12) in favor of IAT. Secondary efficacy analyses all demonstrated a consistent direction of effect toward benefit of IAT. No differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates (9.3% IAT versus 9.7% intravenous, P=1.0) or 90-day mortality (IAT: 12% versus intravenous: 23.9%, P=0.18) were observed. CONCLUSIONS THERAPY did not achieve its primary end point in this underpowered sample. Directions of effect for all prespecified outcomes were both internally and externally consistent toward benefit. It is possible that an alternate method of thrombectomy, primary aspiration, will benefit selected patients harboring large vessel occlusions. Further study on this topic is indicated.

To investigate patterns, as well as drivers, related to changes in mobility across the tri-county region, a random forest regression model was built using sociodemographic, travel, and built environment factors, as well as COVID-19 positive case data. Mobility patterns declined in each county when new COVID-19 infections began to rise, beginning in mid-June 2020. While the mean number of bar and restaurant visits was lower overall due to closures, analysis showed that these visits remained a top factor that impacted mobility for all three counties, even with a rise in cases.

Available evidence is conflicting. We investigated the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the staff of a large public hospital with multiple sites in the Antwerp region of Belgium. Risk factors for infection were identified by means of a questionnaire and human resource data. We performed hospital-wide serology tests in the weeks following the first epidemic wave (16 March to the end of May 2020) and combined the results with the answers from an individual questionnaire. Overall seroprevalence was 7.6%. We found higher seroprevalences in nurses [10.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9C11.2] than in physicians 6.4% (95% CI 4.6C8.7), paramedical 6.0% (95% CI 4.3C8.0) and administrative staff (2.9%; 95% CI 1.8C4.5).

Researchers conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews that explored the experiences of 29 Paralympic hopefuls who compete in thirteen different Paralympic sports. A thematic analysis yielded two superordinate themes: a) Prominent athletic identity, multiplicity over exclusivity; b) Various Impact on AI: Mental adaptation helps overcome the lack of sport participation. Participants in this study possessed prominent strong athletic identities from the benefits of sport participation. Their prioritized athletic role still remains despite setbacks due to the pandemic. However, athletes identified with multiple roles rather than an exclusive athletic identity during COVID-19. As for the impacts on identity, the severity of challenges are determined by the mindset of the athletes. All of the athletes experienced a decreased amount of time and physical participation in their sport. Paralympians whose sole focus was on the loss of physical participation were impacted the most. Athletes who felt unchallenged did so because of their mental adaptation. Through a positive outlook and mentality, athletes were able to effectively cope and not dwell on the negative aspects brought on by the pandemic. In conclusion, having a strong AI did not necessarily coincide with a negative impact on identity from COVID-19, and those who do not possess a strong AI felt their AI was unchallenged by the pandemic.

This cross-sectional study was performed in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during February-April 2020. COVID-19 patients with typical computed tomography (CT) patterns and/or positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. The patients were classified into three groups of moderate, severe, and critical based on disease severity. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were collected and compared.

All children received two 0.5mL doses of BBV152 (Covaxin(R), Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Hyderabad, India), which is the same formulation indicated in adults. Participants were monitored for adverse events, and post-vaccination blood draws were collected to assess neutralising antibodies. A total of 526 children were enrolled into Group 1 (ages 12 through 18 years, n=176), Group 2 (ages 6 through 12 years, n=175), Group 3 (ages 2 through 6 years, n=175). FindingsThere were no serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to an adverse event during the study. Vaccination with BBV152 was generally well tolerated, with no substantial difference in reactogenicity profiles between the different age groups. Similar immune responses were measured as microneutralisation (MNT) antibody titers in all three age groups. Vaccine-induced MNT responses in all groups were comparable to BEI reference sera run in the same assay. Seroconversion (measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)) achieved high levels (95-98%) in all three groups four weeks after the second vaccination.

OBJECTIVE To determine feasibility of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and compare initial outcomes of bariatric surgery and a structured weight loss program for treating T2DM in participants with grades I and II obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 12-month, 3-arm RCT at a single center including 69 participants aged 25 to 55 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 to 40 and T2DM. INTERVENTIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention (LWLI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort were feasibility and effectiveness measured by weight loss and improvements in glycemic control. RESULTS Of 667 potential participants who underwent screening, 69 (10.3%) were randomized. Among the randomized participants, 30 (43%) had grade I obesity, and 56 (81%) were women. Mean (SD) age was 47.3 (6.4) years and hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9% (2.0%). After randomization, 7 participants (10%) refused to undergo their allocated intervention (3 RYGB, 1 LAGB, and 3 LWLI), and 1 RYGB participant was excluded for current smoking. Twenty participants underwent RYGB; 21, LAGB; and 20, LWLI, with 12-month retention rates of 90%, 86%, and 70%, respectively. In the intention-to-treat cohort with multiple imputation for missing data, RYGB participants had the greatest mean weight loss from baseline (27.0%; 95% CI, 30.8-23.3) compared with LAGB (17.3%; 95% CI, 21.1-13.5) and LWLI (10.2%; 95% CI, 14.8-5.61) (P < .001). Partial and complete remission of T2DM were 50% and 17%, respectively, in the RYGB group and 27% and 23%, respectively, in the LAGB group (P < .001 and P = .047 between groups for partial and complete remission), with no remission in the LWLI group. Significant reductions in use of antidiabetics occurred in both surgical groups. No deaths were noted. The 3 serious adverse events included 1 ulcer treated medically in the RYGB group and 2 rehospitalizations for dehydration in the LAGB group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study highlights several potential challenges to successful completion of a larger RCT for treatment of T2DM and obesity in patients with a body mass index of 30 to 40, including the difficulties associated with recruiting and randomizing patients to surgical vs nonsurgical interventions. Preliminary results show that RYGB was the most effective treatment, followed by LAGB for weight loss and T2DM outcomes at 1 year.

The poor prognosis among patients affected with this type of cancer is associated with its high-invasiveness and the lack of successful therapies. A comprehensive understanding for the early molecular mechanisms in glioblastoma would definitely enhance the diagnosis and the treatment strategies. Deregulated expression of key genes that are known to be involved in early neurogenesis could be the instigator of brain tumorigenesis. Ras Like Without CAAX 1 (RIT1) gene that encodes an unusual \\"orphan\\" GTPase protein belongs to this category of critical genes that are known to be involved in controlling sequential proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells. In this study, we surveyed RIT1 gene expression by in-silico approaches to determine its spatio-temporal pattern in glioblastoma. Our results revealed a significant and progressive upregulation of RIT1 mRNA levels in various publicly available datasets. RIT1 expression ranked among the top upregulated genes in glioblastoma cohorts and it correlated with poor overall survival. Genetic and epigenetic analysis of RIT1 didn't reveal any significant aberration that could underlie its deregulated expression. Yet, our results highlighted the possibility of its activity to be transcriptionally controlled by STAT3, one of the main players in the onset of glioblastoma. In conclusion, our study presented for the first time a potential oncogenic role for RIT1 in glioblastoma.

Despite aquatic products' positive effects on human health, their consumption in Turkey has decreased over time and is currently lower than most countries with 6.3 kg per capita. The reason why fish consumption in Turkey is less than in other countries is the more preference for terrestrial production. Therefore, it was aimed to determine the consumption habits of consumers in Turkey's coastal region. Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out between FebCMarch 2018 to determine the consumption habits of aquatic products;28 areas in the coastal regions of Turkey random were selected, 650 volunteer consumers were randomly selected to answer a set of 25 questions. The survey results were evaluated by Chi-square analysis. Findings: From the survey results, 81.4% of the respondents prefer to consume fish from the natural environment. Additionally, from the consumers, there was no statistical difference between natural (81.4%) and aquaculture (85.4%) fish taste (p = 0.05). It was found that 63% of the participants consumed fish meat once a week, with an average per capita consumption of 17.50  2.34 and 10.50  1.66 kg for fish and other seafood consumption, respectively. As a result, it was estimated that fish products were consumed at the desired level in the provinces examined. Accordingly, individuals need to be more conscious and encouraged to increase the consumption of seafood. Research limitations/implications: Because Turkey's seafood consumption is still held in coastal regions in this article are the limitations of this article results. In the future, the difference between inland and coastal regions for fish consumption needs to be explored further. Practical implications: The article says exports of fish / fisheries products have gradually decreased due to the global COVID-19 crisis, but producers / markets will have to target the domestic market more and sales with TL will come to the fore. As a result, it was estimated that fish products were consumed at the desired level in the studied provinces. Accordingly, it has been revealed that individuals should be more conscious and encouraged to increase their consumption of seafood. Social implications: Through this research, the consumption of fisheries consumption preferences of individuals in Turkey's coastal regions uncovered. Originality/value: On the other hand, since Turkey's aquaculture and fisheries sector attaches great importance to foreign sales (exports), domestic consumption amounts are low, and the issue of increasing this is an issue that has remained in the background for the producer. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic period, it was well understood that the closing of the customs gates partially and/or completely and the export figures becoming scanty will cause the end of 2020 and 2021 to be more troublesome in this sense. Therefore, producers/markets will have to target the domestic market more, and sales with TL (Turkish Lira) will come to the fore, various campaigns and price reductions will be made during some special hours during the day in order to increase sales in domestic market. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Consumption of fishery products in Turkey's coastal regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this correspondence is to discuss recent findings related to current trends in airway management and to discuss the utilization rates of video laryngoscopes versus traditional techniques in USA, UK, and Canada.

Analysis is ongoing, but preliminary findings indicate that parents perceived a range of burdens due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These burdens include having to deal with isolation due to social distancing, becoming surrogate teachers through online schooling, and, for some, actually getting COVID-19. When asked about interruptions to their childs medical appointments and care, participants did not describe delays in the diagnostic odysseys as many doctors appointmentswere not interrupted due to COVID-19. However, almost all parents discussed the difficulties of getting needed in-person therapies, like speech, occupational, or physical, for their children either because therapists were no longer offering in person meetings or because parents were not comfortable meeting in person. Some parents also noted difficulties in conducting virtual therapy: having to hold phones while also helping their children and how their children dont perform as well for mom as they do for the therapists. Because of the lack of or delays in therapies, many parents said that their children were not making progress. In addition to these burdens, some parents identified benefits of the COVID-19 pandemic, including that social distancing caused fewer colds or other illnesses to pass through their households. Others discussed feeling lucky that they have not been impacted financially during this time. Overall, we found that NCGENES 2 participants daily lives have been greatly impacted by COVID-19 because of social distancing and online schooling. However, these findings also indicate that it is not the diagnostic odyssey that was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic but the therapeutic odyssey.

Two patients experienced severe muscle weakness, had elevated creatine phosphokinase, and were diagnosed with inflammatory myopathy secondary to COVID-19. Lupus-like syndrome was observed in 2 (0.8%) patients. Conclusion: Rheumatic manifestations are part of the heterogeneous spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, each newly onset rheumatic manifestation warrants exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a rheumatologist should be a part of a multidisciplinary approach towards the COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Rheumatic manifestations in COVID-19 patients-single-center experience amidst the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is the defying crisis of our time.

Accordingly, we develop a new Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that is able to determine social distancing guidelines and altogether provide estimates for the future epidemiological characteristic of the contagion. For such, the viral dynamics are represented through a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) version of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model.

Large-scale surveillance screenings are crucial but can exceed test capacities. We (A) optimized test conditions and (B) implemented pool testing of respiratory swabs into SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. STUDY DESIGN: (A) We determined the optimal pooling strategy and pool size. In addition, we measured the impact of vortexing prior to sample processing, compared pipette-pooling method (by combining transport medium of several specimens) and swab-pooling method (by combining several swabs into a test tube filled with PBS) as well as the sensitivity of three PCR assays. (B) Finally, we applied high-throughput pool testing for diagnostics. RESULTS: (A) In a low prevalence setting, we defined a preferable pool size of ten in a two-stage hierarchical pool testing strategy. Vortexing of swabs (n=33) increased cellular yield by a factor of 2.34. By comparing Ct-values of 16 pools generated with two different pooling strategies, pipette-pooling was more efficient compared to swab-pooling. Measuring dilution series of 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in three PCR assays simultaneously revealed detection rates of 85% (assay I), 50% (assay II), and 95% (assay III) at a 1:100 dilution. (B) We systematically pooled 55,690 samples in a period of 44 weeks resulting in a reduction of 47,369 PCR reactions. CONCLUSIONS: For implementing pooling strategies into high-throughput diagnostics, we recommend utilizing a pipette-pooling method, performing sensitivity validation of the PCR assays used, and vortexing swabs prior to analyses.

Methods: We examined emergency department patients between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes. Findings: Among 316 patients, 33 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 without COVID-19 tested positive for another respiratory virus. Among patients with additional viral testing (27/33), no SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were identified. Compared to those who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7d vs. 3d, p < 0.001). Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p = 0.014). When hospitalized, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p < 0.001) and more often developed ARDS (23% vs. 3%, p < 0.001). Most comorbidities, medications, symptoms, vital signs, laboratories, treatments, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections.

Although most mutual aid groups emerged from local neighbourhoods and communities, official public institutions also fostered community volunteering, namely through the community champions scheme. By considering a broad definition of COVID-19 volunteering, this article describes a systematic review of the literature focused on one broad question: What have we learned about COVID-19 volunteering both at the UK national level and the more local community level? METHODS: A rapid review of the literature in peer-reviewed databases and grey literature was applied in our search, following the PRISMA principles. The search was conducted from 10 to 16 of October 2020, and sources were included on the basis of having been published between January and October 2020, focusing on COVID-19 and addressing community groups, volunteering groups, volunteers, or community champions in the UK. RESULTS: After initial screening, a total of 40 relevant sources were identified. From these, 27 were considered eligible. Findings suggest that food shopping and emotional support were the most common activities, but there were diverse models of organisation and coordination in COVID-19 volunteering. Additionally, community support groups seem to be adjusting their activities and scope of action to current needs and challenges. Volunteers were mostly women, middle-class, highly educated, and working-age people. Social networks and connections, local knowledge, and social trust were key dimensions associated with community organising and volunteering. Furthermore, despite the efforts of a few official public institutions and councils, there has been limited community engagement and collaboration with volunteering groups and other community-based organisations. CONCLUSIONS: We identified important factors for fostering community engagement and COVID-19 volunteering as well as gaps in the current literature. We suggest that future research should be directed towards deepening knowledge on sustaining community engagement, collaboration and community participation over time, during and beyond this pandemic.","output":"What have we learned about COVID-19 volunteering in the UK?

A subset of COVID-19 patients has been reported to have acquired secondary infections by microbial pathogens, such as opportunistic fungal pathogens from the genus Aspergillus. To gain insight into COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), we analyzed the genomes and characterized the phenotypic profiles of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from patients treated in the area of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. By examining the mutational spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion polymorphisms, and copy number variants among 206 genes known to modulate A. fumigatus virulence, we found that CAPA isolate genomes do not exhibit significant differences from the genome of the Af293 reference strain. By examining a number of factors, including virulence in an invertebrate moth model, growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and the MIC of antifungal drugs, we found that CAPA isolates were generally, but not always, similar to A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17. Notably, CAPA isolate D had more putative loss-of-function mutations in genes known to increase virulence when deleted. Moreover, CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent than the other three CAPA isolates and the A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains of A. fumigatus. These findings expand our understanding of the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of isolates that cause CAPA. IMPORTANCE The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has already killed millions of people. COVID-19 patient outcome can be further complicated by secondary infections, such as COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). CAPA is caused by Aspergillus fungal pathogens, but there is little information about the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of CAPA isolates. We conducted genome sequencing and extensive phenotyping of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from Germany. We found that CAPA isolates were often, but not always, similar to other reference strains of A. fumigatus across 206 genetic determinants of infection-relevant phenotypes, including virulence. For example, CAPA isolate D was more virulent than other CAPA isolates and reference strains in an invertebrate model of fungal disease, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains.

Cardiac biomarkers like creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), myoglobin, and high-sensitivity troponin T were usually elevated in early stages. This study aimed to investigate whether the elevated cardiac biomarkers could become effective prognostic predictors for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The present study involved 357 COVID-19 patients. The potential predictors for two study outcomes (in-hospital death and recovery status) in 28 days were selected by LASSO regression analysis. Prognostic values of cardiac biomarkers selected were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under ROC (AUC). RESULTS: After 28-day follow-up, overall 357 patients were divided into death group (n = 25) and survival group (n = 332), or non-recovery group (n = 43) and recovery group (n = 314). The LASSO regression analysis showed elevated CK-MB and myoglobin were independent risk predictors for in-hospital death, and CK-MB and myoglobin were also independent risk predictors for non-recovery. The AUC of CK-MB and myoglobin for in-hospital death were 0.862 (95%CL: 0.804C0.920, p < 0.001) and 0.838 respectively (95%CL: 0.729C0.947, p < 0.001). The AUC of CK-MB and myoglobin for non-recovery were 0.839 (95%CL: 0.786C0.892, p < 0.001) and 0.841 (95%CL: 0.765C0.918, p < 0.001) respectively.

Objectives Provide evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics for viruses on use of in-hospital isolation facilities, oseltamivir and antibiotic usage, and other clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients. Study design A before-after study during two consecutive respiratory viral seasons, including immunocompromised adult patients presenting at a tertiary care emergency department with clinical suspicion of RTI. During the first season (2016/2017), respiratory viruses were detected using inhouse real-time PCR. The second season (2017/2018), we implemented a diagnostic flowchart including a rapid molecular test for 15 respiratory viruses (FilmArray?). We assessed the effect of this implementation on need for isolation, antivirals and empirical antibiotics. Results We included 192 immunocompromised adult patients during the first and 378 during the second season. Respiratory viral testing was performed in 135 patients (70%) during the first and 284 (75%) during the second season (p = 0.218) of which 213 (75%) using the rapid test. After implementation, use of in-hospital isolation facilities was reduced (adjusted odds ratio 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.64). Furthermore, adequate use of oseltamivir improved, with fewer prescriptions in influenza negative patients (0.15, 95%CI 0.08-0.28) and more in influenza positive patients (11.13, 95%CI 1.75C70.86). No effect was observed on empirical antibiotic use, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay or safety outcomes. Conclusions Implementation of rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in adult immunocompromised patients results in more adequate use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities without compromising safety.","output":"More targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities after implementation of a multifaceted strategy including a rapid molecular diagnostic panel for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adult patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe importance of pandemic forecast cannot be overemphasized.

In other medical fields, differences in language have been reported for letters written for female and male applicants; however, data on gender differences in LORs for pharmacy residency applications are currently lacking. METHODS: LORs for applicants to our institution's postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency program for the 2019-2020 academic year were extracted and processed by a natural language processing service. Words within 18 categories were identified and counted for each LOR. Total word count was also compared. RESULTS: Of the 473 LORs included for analysis, 320 (67.7%) were written for female applicants and 153 (32.3%) were written for male applicants. Approximately two-thirds of all writers were women for both female and male applicants. In comparing letters for women and men, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of LORs that contained terms in categories described as gendered, solitary/reserved, and desire. There was no statistically significant difference in total word count or in the presence of words in other categories such as grindstone, standout, agentic, or communal. When controlling for grade point average, writer gender, duration that the writer knew the applicant, and the writer's professional position, there were no changes to the statistical findings.

Host defense peptides (HDPs), previously known as antimicrobial peptides, are emerging as a group of promising antimicrobial candidates for combatting AMR due to their rapid and unique antimicrobial action. Decades of research have advanced our understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical properties of HDPs and their underlying antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial functions, including immunomodulatory, anti-biofilm, and wound healing properties. However, the mission of translating novel HDP-derived molecules from bench to bedside has yet to be fully accomplished, primarily attributed to their intricate structure-activity relationship, toxicity, instability in host and microbial environment, lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacies, and dwindling interest from large pharmaceutical companies. Based on our previous experience and the expanding knowledge gleaned from the literature, this review aims to summarize the novel strategies that have been employed to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy, proteolytic stability, and cell selectivity, which are all crucial factors for bench-to-bedside translation of HDP-based treatment. Strategies such as residues substitution with natural and/or unnatural amino acids, hybridization, L-to-D heterochiral isomerization, C- and N-terminal modification, cyclization, incorporation with nanoparticles, and \\"smart design\\" using artificial intelligence technology, will be discussed.

At varying distances from the RLN, the LSJ was activated (activation study). The LSJ was also applied to the RLN at timed intervals after activation and after a cooling maneuver through placement on the sternocleidomastoid muscle (cooling study). RESULTS In the activation study, there was no adverse EMG event at 2 to 5 mm distance (16 RLNs, 96 tests).

He had no bleeding manifestations and had a good response to prednisone treatment.We review the characteristics of the cases reported to date in the literature, with an analysis of 57 patients. Mean age was 56 years (19.6 SD), and 50.9% were male. This was the first episode of ITP in most of the patients (86.05%), with SARS-CoV-2 acting as the initial trigger. We found that ITP flares may appear in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases. They also appeared at any time during the course of the disease, 48.2% of patients developed it during hospitalization, while it was diagnosed at admission in the rest of the cases. Platelet counts were significantly lower than other ITP series, with a median nadir platelet count of 8  109/L (IQR 2-17.75  109/L). These patients show a higher bleeding rate (61.4%) compared with other ITP series. They also show a better response to treatment, with good response to the first line therapies in 76.9% of them. The most common first-line treatment was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used alone or combined with corticosteroids in 40.4% and 32.7% of cases respectively, while 25% of patients received only corticosteroids.Our review suggests that COVID-19-related ITP can be seen even in previously healthy patients. Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course. Given that this kind of ITP seems to be associated with a higher bleeding risk, its diagnosis in a clinical scenario such as COVID-19, where anticoagulant therapy is frequently used, may be critical.

The new variants receptor binding and immune evasion capability require immediate investigation, especially on the role of L452 substitutions. Herein, coupled with structural comparisons, we show that BA.2 sublineages, including BA.2.12.1 and BA.2.13, exhibit increased ACE2-binding affinities compared to BA.1; while BA.4/BA.5 displays the weakest receptor-binding activity due to F486V and R493Q reversion. Importantly, compared to BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 exhibit stronger neutralization evasion against the plasma of 3-dose vaccinees and, most strikingly, of vaccinated BA.1 convalescents. To delineate the underlying evasion mechanism, we determined the escaping mutation profiles2, epitope distribution3 and Omicron sublineage neutralization efficacy of 1640 RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including 614 isolated from BA.1 convalescents. Interestingly, post-vaccination BA.1 infection mainly recalls wildtype (WT) induced humoral memory and elicits antibodies that neutralize both WT and BA.1. These cross-reactive NAbs are significantly enriched on non-ACE2-competing epitopes; and surprisingly, the majority are undermined by R346 and L452 substitutions, namely R346K (BA.1.1), L452M (BA.2.13), L452Q (BA.2.12.1) and L452R (BA.4/BA.5), suggesting that R346K and L452 mutations appeared under the immune pressure induced by Omicron convalescents. Nevertheless, BA.1 infection can also induce new clones of BA.1-specific antibodies that potently neutralize BA.1 but do not respond to WT SARS-CoV-2 due to the high susceptibility to N501, N440, K417 and E484. However, these NAbs are largely escaped by BA.2 sublineages and BA.4/BA.5 due to D405N and F486V, exhibiting poor neutralization breadths. As for therapeutic NAbs, LY-CoV1404 (Bebtelovimab4) and COV2-2130 (Cilgavimab5) can still effectively neutralize BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5, while the S371F, D405N and R408S mutations carried by BA.2/BA.4/BA.5 sublineages would undermine most broad sarbecovirus NAbs. Together, our results indicate that Omicron can evolve mutations to specifically evade humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection. The continuous evolution of Omicron poses great challenges to SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity and suggests that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not be ideal for achieving broad-spectrum protection.","output":"BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 escape antibodies elicited by Omicron infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.","output":"Information transmission from NFkB signaling dynamics to gene expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to examine the geometric thinking levels of middle school mathematics preservice teachers regarding the problem situations regarding the concept of social distance according to the SOLO taxonomy The research was conducted using the special case method, one of the qualitative research methods The working group, studying at a state university in Turkey in middle school mathematics teaching department consists of 80 preservice teachers While determining the participants, purposeful sampling method was used because the preservice teachers who took \\"Basics of Mathematics II\\" and \\"Special Teaching Methods II\\" courses were selected In the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 preservice teachers since it was aimed to examine remarkable situations from the answers given to open-ended questions Descriptive analysis technique was used while analyzing the data Most of the answers given in the study were found to be below the relational geometric thinking level As a result, it was determined that most of the answers given reflected quantitative learning In line with this result obtained in the study, it is suggested that open-ended questions about life should be included frequently in teaching in order to reach the relational and extended abstract level answers that reflect qualitative learning ? 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz All rights reserved","output":"An investigation of the geometric thinking levels of middle school mathematics preservice teachers according to solo taxonomy: \\"Social distance problems\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Evidence indicates that the actin-binding protein Coronin 3, which is aberrantly expressed in various cancers, is associated with cancer development and progression.

Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure among Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. METHODS: Between April 21 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as follows: <1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and 3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. RESULTS: Of the 4322 eligible participants, 4004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1481 (37.0%), 1644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for less than 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or 3 or more hours per day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76; P=.03), anxiety (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.46; P<.001), and insomnia (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.97; P=.001) than people exposed to information for less than 1 hour per day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1 to 2 hours per day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69; P=.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure of 3 or more hours per day and the severity of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19-related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO2 and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features.

In this paper, four (hyper)graph kernels are proposed and their efficiency and effectiveness are compared in a twofold fashion. First, by inferring the simplicial complexes on the top of underlying graphs and by performing a comparison among 18 benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art approaches; second, by facing a real-world case study (i.e., metabolic pathways classification) where input data are natively represented by hypergraphs.

We developed a simple test that uses colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in forty minutes from sample collection to result. METHODS: We tested 135 nasopharyngeal specimens from patients evaluated for COVID-19 infection at Massachusetts General Hospital. Specimens were either added directly to RT-LAMP reactions, inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step, or inactivated then purified with a silica-particle based concentration method. Amplification was performed with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. RESULTS: Direct RT-LAMP testing of unprocessed specimens could only reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2 (>3,000,000 copies/mL), with sensitivities of 50% (95% CI, 28 to 72) and 59% (95% CI, 43 to 73) in samples collected in universal transport medium and saline, respectively, compared to qPCR. Adding an up-front RNase inactivation step markedly improved the limit of detection to at least 25,000 copies/mL, with 87.5% (95% CI, 72 to 95) sensitivity and 100% specificity (95% CI, 87 to 100). Using both inactivation and purification increased the assay sensitivity by ten-fold, achieving a limit of detection comparable to commercial real-time PCR-based diagnostics. CONCLUSION: By incorporating a fast and inexpensive sample preparation step, RT-LAMP accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 with limited equipment for about US$6 per sample, making this a potentially ideal assay to increase testing capacity especially in resource-limited settings.","output":"Clinical assessment and validation of a rapid and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification without the need for RNA extraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic facecovers have become a common sight.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate a potential difference in eye movement pattern in observes which are exposed to images showing a face without and with facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eye movement of a total of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean age of 31.849.0 years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y- coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focussing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time of focussing on the periorbital region and increased also the number of repeated eye fixations during the interval of visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables with p > 0.433.

The initial version (v1.0) of the VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) software package that GenBank uses to automatically validate and annotate incoming viral sequences is too slow and memory intensive to process many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, long stretches of ambiguous N nucleotides, which are common in many SARS-CoV-2 sequences, prevent VADR from accurate validation and annotation. RESULTS: VADR has been updated to more accurately and rapidly annotate SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Stretches of consecutive Ns are now identified and temporarily replaced with expected nucleotides to facilitate processing, and the slowest steps have been overhauled using blastn and glsearch, increasing speed, reducing the memory requirement from 64Gb to 2Gb per thread, and allowing simple, coarse-grained parallelization on multiple processors per host. CONCLUSION: VADR is now nearly 1000 times faster than it was in early 2020 for processing SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GenBank. It has been used to screen and annotate more than 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences since June 2020, and it is now efficient enough to cope with the current rate of hundreds of thousands of submitted sequences per month.

Following infection, IgG1/3 and IgA1 BCRs increase, somatic hypermutation (SHM) decreases and, in severe disease, IgM and IgA clones are expanded. In contrast, after vaccination the proportion of IgD/M BCRs increase, SHM is unchanged and expansion of IgG clones is prominent. VH1-24, which targets the N-terminal domain (NTD) and contributes to neutralization, is expanded post-infection except in the most severe disease. Infection generates a broad distribution of SARS-CoV-2-specific clones predicted to target the spike protein, whilst a more focused response after vaccination mainly targets the spikes receptor-binding domain.

ACE2 bound to tissue facilitates infectivity of SARS-CoV-2; thus, one could argue that decreasing ACE2 tissue expression would be beneficial. However, ACE2 catalytic activity towards angiotensin I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) mitigates deleterious effects associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on several organs, including a pro-inflammatory status. At the tissue level, SARS-CoV-2 (a) binds to ACE2, leading to its internalization, and (b) favors ACE2 cleavage to form soluble ACE2: these actions result in decreased ACE2 tissue levels. Preserving tissue ACE2 activity while preventing ACE2 shredding is expected to circumvent unrestrained inflammatory response. Concerns have been raised around RAAS modulators and their effects on ACE2 expression or catalytic activity. Various cellular and animal models report conflicting results in various tissues. However, recent data from observational and meta-analysis studies in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have concluded that RAAS modulators do not increase plasma ACE2 levels or susceptibility to infection and are not associated with more severe diseases.

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. METHODS: Using high-throughput sequencing of metatranscriptomic and hybrid captured libraries, we characterized consensus genomes and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) of serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The distribution of iSNVs along the SARS-CoV-2 genome was analyzed and co-occurring iSNVs among COVID-19 patients were identified. We also compared the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 population in the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). RESULTS: The 32 consensus genomes revealed the co-existence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in a single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparing allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed a clear genetic differentiation between intra-host populations from the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events during intra-host migrations. Compared to RT populations, the GIT populations showed a better maintenance and rapid development of viral genetic diversity following the suspected intra-host bottlenecks.

The Community Practice section at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center (OSU-VMC) follows Companion Animal Parasite Council, American Animal Hospital Association, and American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines for parasitology by recommending annual fecal analyses for dogs and prescribing year-round, broad-spectrum parasite preventatives. There is increasing interest in determining if parasite occurrence is changing in client-owned dogs. Therefore, a retrospective study was designed to examine risk factors associated with the detection of parasites in samples submitted to the OSU-VMC Clinical Veterinary Parasitology Diagnostic Laboratory. Of the 1198 canine fecal samples, 254 (21.2%) of these samples had a positive fecal analysis for gastrointestinal (GI) parasites. The age of the dog, time of year, reproductive status, purpose of fecal examination, GI signs, and type of parasite preventatives were assessed as potential risk factors for GI parasite infection in dogs. To determine if Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated hospital restrictions impacted the number of fecal examinations performed, data from January to December 2020, was compared to the same period in 2019. There was nearly a 50% reduction in canine fecal samples submitted to the OSU-VMC Clinical Veterinary Parasitology Diagnostic Laboratory in March 2020 compared to March 2019. At least one canine GI parasite was found in over 20% of all 1198 canine fecal samples (21.2%, 254/1198).

Most rural EDs care for less than five pediatric patients per day and are not well prepared for pediatrics. Simulation has been associated with improvements in pediatric preparedness. The implementation of pediatric simulation in rural settings is challenging due to limited access to equipment and pediatric specialists. Telesimulation involves a remote facilitator interacting with onsite learners. This article aims to describe the implementation experiences and participant feedback of a 1-year remotely facilitated pediatric emergency telesimulation program in three critical-access hospitals. Methods Three hospitals were recruited to participate with a nurse manager serving as the on-site lead. The managers worked with a study investigator to set up the simulation technology during an in-person pilot testing visit with the off-site facilitators. A curriculum consisting of eight pediatric telesimulations and debriefings was conducted over a 12-month period. Participant feedback was collected via a paper survey after each simulation. Implementation metrics were collected after each session including technical and logistic issues. Results Of 147 participant feedback surveys 90% reported that pediatric simulations should be conducted on a regular basis and overall feedback was positive. Forty-seven of 48 simulations were completed on the first attempt with few major technologic issues. The most common issue encountered related to the simulator not working correctly locally and involved the facilitator running the session without the heart and lung sounds. All debriefings occurred without any issues. Conclusions This replicable telesimulation program can be used in the small, rural hospital setting, overcoming time and distance barriers and lending pediatric emergency medicine expertise to the education of critical-access hospital providers.","output":"The Implementation of a Collaborative Pediatric Telesimulation Intervention in Rural Critical Access Hospitals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lesothos COVID-19 response was proactive A state of emergency was declared prior to confirmation of any positive case of the virus in the country The approach was two-pronged in that, first, a state of emergency was declared under section 23 of the Constitution with effect from 18 March 2020 and, second, a disaster-induced state of emergency was declared in terms of sections 3 and 15 of the 1997 Disaster Management Act with effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 An ad hoc body aimed at oversight of the response was also established, but was disbanded after four weeks and replaced with another similarly ad hoc body On the basis of the three core principles of the rule of law, this article interrogates the repercussions of this approach on the principle of the rule of law, in particular, compliance with international human rights obligations contained in ICCPR, the African Charter as well as municipal laws, namely, the Constitution and the Disaster Management Act It is argued that while Lesotho had to act swiftly in order to protect lives, in so acting the existing legal and institutional frameworks were ignored in violation of the rule of law principle The article concludes by recommending that in order to avoid similar challenges in the future, the existing legal and institutional frameworks must be strengthened rather than replaced as such duplication of institutions depletes meagre resources and creates a platform for the misuse of public funds and corruption ? 2020, Pretoria University Law Press All rights reserved","output":"Implications of lesothos covid-19 response framework for the rule of law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is focused on the issue of discrimination against Roma communities in the use of educational online platforms on account of failure to provide digital consent.

Here we report cryptic transmission associated with high DV viral load among vaccinated patients on an inpatient medical-surgical ward. MethodsThis observational study included all persons diagnosed with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) from March 11, 2021 to July 31, 2021, including those tested for surveillance, admission, symptoms, and as part of an outbreak investigation in July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Cepheid). Variants were identified by MassARRAY SARS-CoV-2 Variant Panel (36-plex PCR, Agena BioScience) for most breakthrough cases after June 2021 Viral genomic sequencing was performed by the Jackson Laboratory. ResultsAn inpatient was diagnosed with asymptomatic DV infection on routine pre-discharge testing. Contact tracing detected infection in 6 of 38 patients (15.8%), 1 of 168 staff (0.6%), and 1 of 6 visitors (16.7%). Infection at the time of diagnosis was asymptomatic in 4 proximate, vaccinated patients, 1 vaccinated visitor, and 1 vaccinated employee caring for 1 undiagnosed, infected, vaccinated patient. Patients were unmasked, whereas staff wore surgical masks. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) for breakthrough infections indicated more than 1000-fold higher viral load for DV (Ct:21.7{+/-}4.3; n=15) than for earlier variants (Ct: 31.8{+/-}10.9, n=12; p=.003 (t-test)). ConclusionThese findings demonstrate transmission of DV with high viral load between vaccinated inpatients, the continued efficacy of masking and vaccination for protecting healthcare personnel, and the potential need for post-admission surveillance to prevent cryptic DV transmission.","output":"Cryptic Transmission of the Delta Variant AY.3 Sublineage of SARS-CoV-2 among Fully Vaccinated Patients on an Inpatient Ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing global pandemic associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. RT-qPCR has become the diagnostic standard for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in most countries. COVID-19 diagnosis generally relies upon RT-qPCR-mediated identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is costly, labor-extensive, and requires specialized training and equipment. Herein, we established a novel one-tube rapid diagnostic approach based upon formamide and colorimetric RT-LAMP (One-Pot RT-LAMP) that can be used to diagnose COVID-19 without the extraction of specific viral RNA. The technique could visually detect SARS-CoV-2 within 45 min with a limit of detection of 5 copies per reaction in extracted RNA, and about 7.66 virus copies per L in viral transport medium. The One-Pot RT-LAMP test showed a high specificity without cross-reactivity with 12 viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human infectious influenza virus (H1N1/H3N2 of influenza A and B virus, ect. We validated this One-Pot RT-LAMP approach by its successful use for the analysis of 45 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples, yielding results identical to those of traditional RT-qPCR analyses, while achieving good selectivity and sensitivity relative to a commercial RT-qPCR approach. As such, this One-Pot RT-LAMP technology may be a valid means of conducting high-sensitivity, low-cost and rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification without the extraction of viral RNA.","output":"A novel One-pot rapid diagnostic technology for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has a significant impact on global health, travel and economy.

The purpose of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of intraoperative LLD and CO measurement with express workflow robotic THA. METHODS Between February 2018 and December 2019, 30 patients underwent an express workflow robot-assisted primary THA for intraoperative LLD and CO measurements. Postoperative radiographs were used for LLD and CO measurement. In order to examine the accuracy of the robotic system assessment, the absolute difference between the robotic assessments and radiographic evaluations was calculated. RESULTS Intraoperative robotic measurements reported a mean error of 0.2-0.6 mm for each registration, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.311). The average absolute discrepancies between the robotic and radiographic assessments in the LLD and CO measurements were 1.3  1.5 mm (p = 0.17) and 1.1  0.9 mm (p = 0.11), respectively, while the Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.69 and 0.71.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of overall burnout among Interns-Residents and general physicians (GPs)-Specialists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 Interns-Residents and 212 GPs-Specialists in university-affiliated hospitals and clinics in Shiraz, Iran. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit the samples, and the data were gathered using Maslach Burnout Inventory that was previously validated for the Persian language. We used covariance analysis and multiple logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: The mean age of participants was 31.44 (ranged 21-62) years. Multiple logistic regression for GPs-Specialists showed that working in COVID-19 wards during June-July (OR = 13.93, P = 0.01, CI: 3.61-53.51) was associated with increased odds of overall burnout. Moreover, older age among GPs-Specialists was associated with decreased odds of overall burnout (OR = 0.94, P = 0.01, CI: 0.90-0.98). On the other hand, the odds of overall burnout among Interns-Residents was not significantly different between various periods (P = 0.94). Furthermore, age (OR = 0.24, P = 0.01, CI: 0.04-0.47) and being married (OR = 0.31, P = 0.02, CI: 0.12-0.81) were positively associated with decreased odds of overall burnout among Interns-Residents.

Scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi often presents as an undifferentiated febrile illness and remains under appreciated due to the limited availability of diagnostic tests. This tropical rickettsial illness is increasingly recognized as an important cause of non-malaria acute undifferentiated fever in Asia. This study aimed to investigate behavioural and ecological related risk factors of scrub typhus to prevent this potentially life-threatening disease in Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted a clinical hospital-based active surveillance study, and a retrospective residence-enrolment date-age-matched caseCcontrol study in Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam, from August 2018 to March 2020. Clinical examinations, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgM tests were applied to define cases and controls. All enrolled participants filled out a questionnaire including demographic socio-economic status, personal behaviors/protective equipment, habitat connections, land use, and possible exposure to the vector. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to define the scrub typhus associated risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 44 confirmed cases and matched them with 152 controls. Among cases and controls, the largest age group was the 41C50 years old and males accounted for 61.4% and 42.8%, respectively. There were similarities in demographic characteristics between the two groups, with the exception of occupation. Several factors were significantly associated with acquisition of scrub typhus, including sitting/laying directly on household floor [adjusted OR (aOR) = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.6C15.1, P = 0.006], household with poor sanitation/conditions (aOR = 7.9, 95% CI: 1.9C32.9, P = 0.005), workplace environment with risk (aOR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.2C7.6, P = 0.020), always observing mice around home (aOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.4C9.9, P = 0.008), and use of personal protective equipment in the field (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1C1.1, P = 0.076). CONCLUSIONS: Ecological and household hygiene-related factors were more associated with scrub typhus infection, than individual-level exposure activities in the hyper-endemic area.

The system is overstretched with little to no surge capacity to deal with crisis situations, its reach restrained due to overreliance on brick and mortar clinics, and its behavior overwhelmingly more reactive than preventive. As delivery systems reorganize on the fly to fight COVID-19, many are turning to tools like telemedicine, pre-visit planning, and centralized population health programs. We propose how these rapid transformations happening across the country, born out of necessity, present a silver lining opportunity to fix primary care. We describe how integrating telemedicine, patient-generated data, and preventive care into a retooled intake and care optimization process is achievable through an approach powered by humans and augmentable with artificial intelligence. Primary care must retool to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and emerge in the post-crisis world better equipped to care for a wounded nation. Our collective willingness to invest in primary care teams, relaxation of rules around telemedicine reimbursement and patient-generated data sharing, workforce training, and movement to value-based payments are necessary to achieve this vision.","output":"Retooling Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Well parameterised epidemiological models including accurate representation of contacts, are fundamental to controlling epidemics. However, age-stratified contacts are typically estimated from pre-pandemic/peace-time surveys, even though interventions and public response likely alter contacts.

This data includes age-stratified population size, cases, deaths, hospital admissions, and results from the Coronavirus Infection Survey (almost 9000 observations in all). Fitting stochastic compartmental models to such detailed data is extremely challenging, especially considering the large number of model parameters being estimated (over 150). An efficient new inference algorithm ABC-MBP combining existing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodology with model-based proposals (MBP) is applied. Modified contact rates are inferred alongside time-varying reproduction numbers that quantify changes in overall transmission due to pandemic response, and age-stratified proportions of asymptomatic cases, hospitalisation rates and deaths. These inferences are robust to a range of assumptions including the values of parameters that cannot be estimated from available data.

The kinetics of the assembly of SGs in the living cells demonstrated that Tudor-SN co-localizes with G3BP and is recruited to the same SGs in response to different stress stimuli. Knockdown of endogenous Tudor-SN did not inhibit the formation of SGs, but retarded the aggregation of small SGs into large SGs. Thus Tudor-SN may not be an initiator as essential as G3BP for the formation of SGs, but affects the aggregation of SGs. These findings identify Tudor-SN as a novel component of SGs.

We review here the current treatment options for non-influenza respiratory viruses and promising candidate antiviral agents currently in development. RECENT FINDINGS Small molecule antiviral agents active against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), such as ALS-8176 and GS-5806, show considerable promise in challenge studies and are undergoing late-phase clinical trials in hospitalised adults and children. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) active against non-influenza respiratory viruses are broadly at a preclinical stage. Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as favipiravir and nitrazoxanide, have potential utility in treating illness caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses but further definitive clinical trials are needed. SUMMARY Severe non-influenza respiratory virus infection is common and current treatment is largely supportive. Ribavirin is used in immunocompromised patients but its use is limited by toxicity and the evidence for its efficacy is weak. Effective antiviral treatment for RSV may shortly become available, pending the results of ongoing clinical trials. For other non-influenza viruses, effective treatments may become available in the medium term.

A deeper understanding of the slow progress of vaccination in Japan can be instructive for COVID-19 booster vaccination and vaccinations during future pandemics. Objective This retrospective study aims to analyze the slow progress of early-stage vaccination in Japan by exploring opinions and sentiment toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Japanese tweets before and at the beginning of vaccination. Methods We collected 144,101 Japanese tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between August 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. We visualized the trend of the tweets and sentiments and identified the critical events that may have triggered the surges. Correlations between sentiments and the daily infection, death, and vaccination cases were calculated. The latent dirichlet allocation model was applied to identify topics of negative tweets from the beginning of vaccination. We also conducted an analysis of vaccine brands (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca) approved in Japan. Results The daily number of tweets continued with accelerating growth after the start of large-scale vaccinations in Japan. The sentiments of around 85% of the tweets were neutral, and negative sentiment overwhelmed the positive sentiment in the other tweets. We identified 6 public-concerned topics related to the negative sentiment at the beginning of the vaccination process. Among the vaccines from the 3 manufacturers, the attitude toward Moderna was the most positive, and the attitude toward AstraZeneca was the most negative. Conclusions Negative sentiment toward vaccines dominated positive sentiment in Japan, and the concerns about side effects might have outweighed fears of infection at the beginning of the vaccination process. Topic modeling on negative tweets indicated that the government and policy makers should take prompt actions in building a safe and convenient vaccine reservation and rollout system, which requires both flexibility of the medical care system and the acceleration of digitalization in Japan. The public showed different attitudes toward vaccine brands.

The three cultural groups examined were secular Jews, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arabs. We compared these cultural groups during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020) as a second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 248 secular Jews, 243 Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 203 Arabs, who were 18C70 years old (M = 37.14, SD = 12.62). The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including the Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of emotional/psychological distress (i.e., somatization, depression, and anxiety) and questionnaires about sense of coherence and different types of hope (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal) as measures of coping resources and resiliency. Differences were found between the three groups in terms of several variables. The Arab participants reported the highest levels of emotional distress and the lowest levels of interpersonal and transpersonal hope; whereas the Ultra-Orthodox participants revealed the highest levels of sense of coherence and other resilience factors. A structural equation model revealed that, in addition to the sociodemographic factors, only sense of coherence and intrapersonal hope played significant roles in explaining emotional distress, explaining 60% of the reported distress among secular Jews, 41% among Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 48% among Arabs. We discuss our findings in light of the salutogenic and hope theories.

Identifying COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation may identify subgroups who could benefit from targeted immunomodulatory treatments. Analysis of cytokine levels at the point of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can identify patients at risk of deterioration. METHODS: We used a multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IFN- in 100 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at admission to University Hospital Southampton (UK). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Age > 70 years was the strongest predictor of death (OR 28, 95% CI 5.94, 139.45). IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1 and IL-33 were significantly associated with adverse outcome.

The teachers were interviewed, and the data were transcribed and analyzed by creating a data repository, expanding the codes, describing the coded data, and drawing conclusions. The results revealed that the teachers had several strategies used, which were to increase students interest in learning, provide students with knowledge and attention, create efficient learning resources, and use SIMPEL (Sistem Informasi Manajemen Pembelajaran or Learning Management Information System), which is specifically available only in Ngawi. SIMPEL was specially developed by the Ngawi district education office, to ensure that the learning processes in Ngawi Regency continue to run optimally during the COVID-19 outbreak. SIMPEL substituted the use of online YouTube videos and materials because the materials were already provided by the system, decreasing the need for the teachers to depend on other resources.

Informed consent for surgery often focuses on risk centered information due to high liability risks for treatment errors. This may affect patients anxiety of adverse events and the nocebo effect. This study focuses on the optimization of pre-surgical information on risks and complications, and at the same time reconciles these information with legal requirements. METHODS: The development, piloting, and evaluation of evidence-based informed consent forms for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and related anesthesia procedures will follow the UK MRC Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. Conducting different sub-studies, we will (I) qualitatively explore the information acquisition and decision-making processes, (II) develop and pilot test evidence-based informed consent forms on the example of TKA and related anesthesia procedures, (III) conduct a monocentric interrupted time series (ITS) pilot study to evaluate the effects of evidence-based informed consent forms in comparison with standard consent forms, and (IV) perform a process evaluation to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the intervention and to analyze mechanisms of impact. DISCUSSION: The evidence-based and understandable presentation of risks in informed consent forms aims at avoiding distorted risk depiction and strengthening the patients competencies to correctly assess the risks of undergoing surgery. This might reduce negative expectations and anxiety of adverse events, which in turn might reduce the nocebo effect. At the same time, the practitioners acceptance of evidence-based informed consent forms meeting legal requirements could be increased. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04669483.

Despite more than 90% of documented cases being classified as recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a proportion of patients reported a wide variety of persisting symptoms after the initial onset or acute phase of the infection, often referred to as Long Covid. As data on the symptomatology of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually becomes available, there is an urgent need to organise and synthesise the data in order to define what constitutes Long Covid and assist with its management in clinical and community settings. METHODS: This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search strategy will be developed in accordance with the Cochrane highly sensitive search guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched for studies to include in the systematic review and meta-analysis: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), Science direct, EMBASE, Mednar, Psych INFO, and EBSCOhost. Dual screening will be applied at every screening stage. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full text of potentially eligible studies following the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to select studies to include in the review. As heterogeneity is anticipated between the included studies, data will be pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. A clustering analytic approach will be applied to identify symptoms groupings and assign the symptoms into clusters. R statistical software will be used for the meta-analysis.

We validated and compared the usefulness of two classification systems reported earlier-a severity grading proposed by Siddiqi and a system from the National Australian COVID-19 guideline. Both had not been validated externally and were now tested for their ability to predict complications. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 across all severity stages were enrolled. The clinical severity was graded at admission and during hospitalization. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality, a composite primary (mortality, incident acute respiratory distress syndrome, incident mechanical ventilation), a secondary endpoint (mortality, incident acute myocardial injury, incident venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stroke) and progression of severity grades. RESULTS: Of 109 patients 17 died, 31 and 48 developed the primary and secondary endpoint, respectively. Worsening of the severity grade by at least one stage occurred in 27 and 28 patients, respectively. Siddiqi and Australian classification were identified as independent predictors for the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.30, p<0.001 and aHR 2.08, p<0.001), for the secondary endpoint (aHR 2.12, p<0.001 and aHR 1.79, p<0.001) and mortality (aHR 2.30, p = 0.071 and aHR 1.98, p = 0.017).

We analyzed the factors associated with death in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. This cross-sectional study evaluated the association between individual demographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables and the outcome (death) using data from the Unified Health System information systems.

Three monofocal toric IOLs (the Lentis LT [Oculentis, Berlin, Germany], enVista [Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY], and AcrySof IQ [Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX]) and one multifocal toric IOL (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR; Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) were implanted. Preoperative and postoperative images were taken to calculate the misalignment due to the marking method. To evaluate rotation in the different follow-up visits, another photograph was taken 1 hour and 1, 7 and 30 days postoperatively. Refraction, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), and corrected distance visual acuity were measured 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS Postoperative UDVA was 0.1 logMAR or better in 64.6% of eyes implanted with monofocal IOLs and 46.4% of eyes implanted with multifocal IOLs. The enVista toric IOL showed the best UDVA compared to the other monofocal IOLs, with 81% of eyes with 0.1 logMAR or better.

Ferritin is a key mediator of immune dysregulation through direct immunosuppression contributing to cytokine storm resulting in fatal outcome in COVID-19. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to estimate serum ferritin in diabetic (cases) and non-diabetic (controls) COVID-19 patients and its correlation with their diabetic profile (FBS, PPBS, RBS, and HbA1C). Materials and Methods: A retrospective case-control study conducted at Rajarajeswari Medical College and Hospital, Bengaluru, for a period of 8 months among diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Results: The study population consisted of 957 individuals, out of them, 425 patients were type 2 diabetes mellitus and 532 were non-diabetic COVID-19-positive patients (controls). Diabetic profile parameters (FBS, PPBS, RBS, and HbA1c) and serum ferritin were significantly (P<0.05) high in cases as compared to controls. Among diabetic COVID-19, the glycated hemoglobin and serum ferritin showed a significantly positive correlation (r=0.55) with serum ferritin (mean=648.98320.48). Conclusion: Hyperferritinemia is more prevalent in diabetic COVID-19 individuals. Serum ferritin can be considered as a valuable biomarker to screen the diabetic and non-diabetic for the presence of hyperinflammation and to predict severity of COVID-19 infection so that it will help the clinician for proper management.

The gold standard for confirming COVID-19 infection is through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The lack of sufficient RT-PCR testing capacity, false negative results of RT-PCR, time to get back the results and other logistical constraints enabled the epidemic to continue to spread albeit interventions like regional or complete country lockdowns. Therefore, chest radiographs such as CT and X-ray can be used to supplement PCR in combating the virus from spreading. In this work, we focus on proposing a deep learning tool that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays and CT scan images.

Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS: We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P = .894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION: We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.","output":"COVID-19 Severity and Outcomes in Patients With Cancer: A Matched Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact in Asia and has placed significant burden on already stretched healthcare systems.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study utilising snowball sampling was performed involving doctors, nurses and allied health professions from 23 hospitals in Singapore, Malaysia, India and Indonesia between 29 May 2020 and 13 July 2020. This survey collated demographic data and workplace conditions and included three validated questionnaires: Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ);Oldenburg Burnout Inventory;and Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale. We performed multivariate mixed model regression to assess for independent associations with the SAQ Total Percentage Agree Rates (PAR). RESULTS: We obtained 3,163 responses. A SAQ Total PAR of 35.7%, 15.0%, 51.0% and 3.3% was calculated among respondents from Singapore, Malaysia, India and Indonesia, respectively. Burnout scores were highest among respondents from Indonesia and lowest in respondents from India at 70.9%-85.4% versus 56.3%-63.6%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that meeting burnout and depression thresholds, and shifts lasting >= 12 hours were significantly associated with lower SAQ Total PAR. CONCLUSION: Addressing factors contributing to high burnout and depression, and placing strict limits on work hours per shift may contribute significantly towards improving safety culture among HCWs and should remain priorities as this pandemic continues.","output":"Safety attitudes, burnout and wellbeing among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: an Indo-Pacific regional cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mammography is widely used for breast cancer screening but suffers from a high false-positive rate.

Methods: This retrospective observational study included adults with HCM and positive PCR/antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 at a large urban hospital system in the New York from January, 2020 to January, 2021. Results: Seventy individuals were included, with a mean (SD) age of 60.1 (15.1) years, 39 (55.7%) of whom were male, and 42 (60%) white. Forty-five (65.3%) patients had obstructive HCM. Hypertension and obesity (BMI  30) were present in 45 (64.3%) and 37 (52.9%) patients, and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes was high. Common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, affecting 33 (47.1%), 33 (47.1%), 28 (40.0%), and 28 (40.0%) patients, respectively.

Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses. Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins' in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model, we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza. Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro.

Firstly, it is non-adaptive and thus possibly faster to perform than adaptive methods which is crucial in exponentially growing pandemic phases. Secondly, due to nonnegativity of measurements and an appropriate noise model, the compressed sensing problem can be solved with the non-negative least absolute deviation regression (NNLAD) algorithm.

The objective was to study the safety and effect of a combination of music and abdominally administered low-frequency vibrations on pain intensity in elderly patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: This trial was an international multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study. Patients at age  65 years with musculoskeletal pain for  3 months and a daily pain score  4 out of 10 were recruited at three centers. They were randomized to receive either a combination of music and low-frequency (20C100 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen, or a combination with the same music but with higher frequency (200C300 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen. Low-frequency vibrations were expected to result in pain reduction measured with a numeric pain rating scale (NRS). Patients in both groups received eight treatments of the music combined with the vibrations in three weeks. Primary outcomes were safety (Serious Adverse Events) and pain intensity measured at baseline, after the last treatment and at six weeks follow-up. Multilevel linear model analyses were performed to study group and time effects. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle. After 344 treatments, 1 Adverse Event was found related to the intervention, while 13 Adverse Events were possibly related. A multilevel linear model showed that the interaction effect of group by time did not predict pain intensity (F[1, 45.93] = 0.002, p = 0.97) when comparing pain intensity at baseline, after the last treatment and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of music and abdominally administered vibrations was found to be safe and well tolerated by the elderly patients. However, over time, neither the low-frequency treatment group nor the high-frequency treatment group provided clinically meaningful pain relief.

Up to now, no specific therapy against COVID-19 disease exists. This paper aims to review COVID-19 treatment options currently under investigation. We divided the studied drugs into three categories (antiviral, immunomodulatory and other drugs). For each molecule, we discussed the putative mechanisms by which the drug may act against SARS-CoV-2 or may affect COVID-19 pathogenesis and the main clinical studies performed so far. The published clinical studies suffer from methodological limitations due to the emergency setting in which they have been conducted. Nevertheless, it seems that the timing of administration of the diverse categories of drugs is crucial in determining clinical efficacy. Antiviral drugs, in particular Remdesivir, should be administered soon after symptoms onset, in the viraemic phase of the disease; whereas, immunomodulatory agents, such as tocilizumab, anakinra and steroids, may have better results if administered in pneumonia/hyperinflammatory phases. Low-molecular-weight heparin may also have a role when facing COVID-19-related coagulopathy. Up to now, treatment choices have been inferred from the experience with other coronaviruses or viral infection outbreaks. Hopefully, in the near future, new treatment strategies will be available thanks to increased knowledge on SARS-CoV2 virus and COVID-19 pathogenesis.

The present study demonstrates that in infected cells, the capsid protein is associated with the nonstructural p150 protein via the short self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein. Mutational analyses indicated that hydrophobic amino acids in this N-terminal region are essential for its N-terminal self-interaction, which is critical for the capsid-p150 association. An analysis based on a subgenomic replicon system demonstrated that the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein plays a key role in promoting viral gene expression. Analyses using a virus-like particle (VLP) system also showed that the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production but is critical for VLP infectivity. These results demonstrate that the close cooperative actions of the capsid protein and p150 require the short self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein during the life cycle of the rubella virus.

In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, and climate conditions have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Exhibited positive correlations of ambient ozone levels and negative correlations of NO2 with the increased rates of COVID-19 infections (Total number, Daily New positive and Total Deaths cases), can be attributed to airborne bioaerosols distribution. The results show positive correlation of daily averaged O3 with air temperature and inversely correlations with relative humidity and precipitation rates.

Emergency medicine (EM) is no exception. Since its origins over 50 year ago, EM has struggled to fulfill its research mission. EM ranks last among clinical specialties in the percent of medical school faculty who are NIH-funded principal investigators (PIs) (1.7%) and percent of medical school departments with NIH-funded PIs (33%). Although there has been a steady increase in the number of NIH-funded projects and total NIH dollars, the slowing growth in the number of NIH-funded PIs and lack of growth in the number of EM departments with NIH-funded PIs is cause for concern. In response, the AACEM Research Task Force proposes a set of 2030 strategic goals for the EM research enterprise that are based on sustaining historic growth rates in NIH-funding. These goals have been endorsed by the AACEM Executive committee and the Boards of SAEM, ACEP, and AAEM. The 2030 strategic goals include 200 NIH-funded projects led by 150 EM PIs in at least 50 EM Depts with over $100M in annual funding resulting in over 3% of EM faculty being NIH-funded PIs. Achieving these goals will require a targeted series of focused strategies to increase the number of EM faculty who are competitive for NIH funding. This requires a coordinated, intentional effort with investments at the national, departmental, and individual levels. These efforts are ideally led by medical school department chairs, who can create the culture and provide the resources needed to be successful.

Capnocytophaga, Veillonella, and other oral opportunistic pathogens were found in the BALF of the COVID-19 patients by mNGS.

Lung hypoxia, typical symptoms of COVID-19, would favor the growth of anaerobes and facultative anaerobes originating from the oral microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 may aggravate lung disease by interacting with the lung or oral microbiota via mechanisms involving changes in cytokines, T cell responses, and the effects of host conditions such as aging and the oral microbiome changes due to systemic diseases. Because the oral microbiome is closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 co-infections in the lungs, effective oral health care measures are necessary to reduce these infections, especially in severe COVID-19 patients.

Material and methods: This prospective, observational, cohort study included patients with COVID-19 symptoms presenting to the emergency department over a two-month period. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and the data of all-cause mortality within 30 days after admission were noted, and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score and the Rapid Acute Physiology Score were calculated by the researchers. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the discriminative ability of the scores. Results: A total of 555 patients with a mean of age of 49.4 +/- 16.8 years were included in the study. The rate of 30-day mortality was 3.9% for the whole study cohort, 7.2% for the patients with a positive rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and 1.2% for those with a negative rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2. In the group of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, according to the best Youden's index, the cut-off value for the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score was determined as 3.5 (sensitivity: 81.82%, specificity: 73.08%), and the area under curve (AUC) value was 0.840 (95% confidence interval 0.768-0.913).

Breeding of resistant/tolerant tomato cultivars could be an effective strategy for T. absoluta management but, despite the economic importance of tomato, very limited information is available about its response to this treat. To elucidate the defense mechanisms to herbivore feeding a comparative analysis was performed between a tolerant and susceptible cultivated tomato at both morphological and transcriptome level to highlight constitutive leaf barriers, molecular and biochemical mechanisms to counter the effect of T. absoluta attack. RESULTS The tolerant genotype showed an enhanced constitutive barrier possibly as result of the higher density of trichomes and increased inducible reactions upon mild infestation thanks to the activation/repression of key transcription factors regulating genes involved in cuticle formation and cell wall strength as well as of antinutritive enzymes, and genes involved in the production of chemical toxins and bioactive secondary metabolites. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our findings suggest that tomato resilience to the South America pinworm is achieved by a combined strategy between constitutive and induced defense system. A well-orchestrated modulation of plant transcription regulation could ensure a trade-off between defense needs and fitness costs. Our finding can be further exploited for developing T. absoluta tolerant cultivars, acting as important component of integrated pest management strategy for more sustainable production.","output":"Tomato transcriptomic response to Tuta absoluta infestation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Our study aimed to explore the risk factors in bloodstream infections Klebsiella pneumoniae (BSI-KP) patients and establish nomograms to predict the probability of BSI-CRKP and the prognosis of BSI-KP.

A key regulator of this process is mTORC1, a complex comprising the mTOR kinase. Growth factors activate mTORC1 via a pathway involving PI3-kinase, Akt, the TSC complex and the GTPase Rheb. In non-neuronal cells, translocation of mTORC1 to late endocytic compartments (LEs), where Rheb is enriched, is triggered by amino acids. However, the regulation of mTORC1 in neurons remains unclear. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we observed that BDNF and treatments activating NMDA receptors trigger a robust increase in mTORC1 activity. NMDA receptors activation induced a significant recruitment of mTOR onto lysosomes even in the absence of external amino acids, whereas mTORC1 was evenly distributed in neurons under resting conditions. NMDA receptor-induced mTOR translocation to LEs was partly dependent on the BDNF receptor TrkB, suggesting that BDNF contributes to the effect of NMDA receptors on mTORC1 translocation. In addition, the combination of Rheb overexpression and artificial mTORC1 targeting to LEs by means of a modified component of mTORC1 fused with a LE-targeting motif strongly activated mTOR. To gain spatial and temporal control over mTOR localization, we designed an optogenetic module based on light-sensitive dimerizers able to recruit mTOR on LEs. In cells expressing this optogenetic tool, mTOR was translocated to LEs upon photoactivation. In the absence of growth factor, this was not sufficient to activate mTORC1. In contrast, mTORC1 was potently activated by a combination of BDNF and photoactivation. The data demonstrate that two important triggers of synaptic plasticity, BDNF and NMDA receptors, synergistically power the two arms of the mTORC1 activation mechanism, i.e., mTORC1 translocation to LEs and Rheb activation. Moreover, they unmask a functional link between NMDA receptors and mTORC1 that could underlie the changes in the synaptic proteome associated with long-lasting changes in synaptic strength.

A robust methodology for enhancing organizational readiness for implementation (ORI) has the potential to improve implementation outcomes of EBPs and ensure better services for people with a psychiatric disability. Prior work established a framework of implementation strategies targeting ORI enhancement by asking a group of implementation experts from various fields to categorize strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) Project into three readiness stages, consistent with the pre-action stages of the Transtheoretical Model of behavioral change: Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation. The current study provides initial confirmation and refinement to this expert-driven typology based on community mental health field experiences. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with stakeholders involved in a recent EBP implementation project. Participants included staff (n=9) from four community mental health agencies and the implementation team who facilitated the project (n=3). Their pre-implementation experiences were compared with the experts typology to identify consistencies and discrepancies. RESULTS: The participants experiences were congruent with two thirds of the strategies identified by the experts for specific ORI stages. The refinements included 12 strategies used in additional stages beyond the experts classification, four strategies from the ERIC list that were not included in the ORI typology, and five new strategies.

Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of depression in PD is unclear, studies suggest a causal relationship with abnormal neurotransmission and abnormal adult neurogenesis.

Since the initial outbreak, strategies to detect and isolate patients have been important to avoid uncontrolled viral spread. Although testing capacities have been upscaled, there is still a need for reliable high throughput test systems, specifically those that require alternative consumables. Therefore, we tested and compared two different methods for the detection of viral PCR products: rRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS). METHODS: Viral RNA was isolated and amplified from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were analyzed by MS. Results of the rRT-PCR and the MS protocol were compared. RESULTS: Results of rRT-PCR and the MS test system were in concordance in all samples. Time-to-results was faster for rRT-PCR. Hands-on-time was comparable in both assays. CONCLUSIONS: MS is a fast, reliable and cost-effective alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs.","output":"Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 emerged from Wuhan;China in December 2019 took the whole world in its grip in mere few months the cases were found in almost every part of the globe Pakistan too, was severely impacted tolling 233,500 cases of the coronavirus and 6,035 deaths to date Most of the schools and colleges resorted to an online educational platform in order to resume work and discipline in life during such chaos, perhaps the most affected were the professionals of healthcare setup including medical students who reported to have far higher rates of depression than the average person Objectives: To examine the association of COVID-19 to the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or stress amongst medical students of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year MBBS in this quarantine period and their attitude towards online classes Methodology: It was a cross sectional study conducted in Clifton campus of Ziauddin University Karachi in the month of May 2020 Medical students studying in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year MBBS were included in the study The total calculated sample size was n=105, Non-probability Consecutive sampling technique was used to recruit the participants Depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) was used to assess psychological health among study participants Results: DASS score showed that Stress and anxiety were significantly (p=0 001) prevalent in students however there are no significant findings observed related to depression, many responded that their life routine is altered and their attitude towards online session was significantly positive Conclusion: Stress and anxiety was found to be prevalent in in Medical students predominantly in students studying in 1st year MBBS, their life routine is disturbed and their attitude towards online classes was welcoming","output":"COVID-19 Online Teaching and its Impact on Psychological Health in Higher Education: A Cross Sectional Study on Medical Students of 1st 2nd and 3rd Year MBBS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Food insecurity affects dietary behaviors and diet quality in adults. This relationship is not widely studied among early care and education (ECE) providers, a unique population with important influences on childrens dietary habits. Our studys objective was to explore how food insecurity affected diet quality and dietary behaviors among ECE providers. METHODS: We used baseline data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial (January 2019?December 2020) on 216 ECE providers under the Pennsylvania Head Start Association. We used radar plots to graph scores for the Healthy Eating Index 2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) 2010 and fitted a multivariate regression model for diet quality measures, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 216 participants, 31.5% were food insecure. ECE providers who were food insecure had a lower AHEI-2010 mean score (mean difference for food insecure vs food secure = ?4.8; 95% CI, ?7.8 to ?1.7; P = .002). After adjusting for covariates, associations remained significant (mean difference = ?3.9; 95% CI, ?7.5 to ?0.4; P = .03). Food insecure ECE providers were less likely to use nutrition labels (22.8% vs 39.1%; P = .046) and more likely to report cost as a perceived barrier to eating fruits and vegetables. CONCLUSION: We found a significant inverse association between food insecurity and the AHEI-2010 diet quality score among ECE providers after adjusting for covariates. More studies are needed to examine the effects of food insecurity on dietary behaviors of ECE providers and their response to nutrition education programs targeting their health.","output":"Association Between Food Insecurity and Diet Quality Among Early Care and Education Providers in the Pennsylvania Head Start Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, an individual's choices can determine outcomes not only for the individual but also for the entire community.

Although most infections resulted in respiratory illness, some severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity. To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury. In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1). The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9) outbreaks.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates influenza H7N9 virus-induced acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed Distilled Graph Attention Policy Network (DGAPN), a reinforcement learning model to generate novel graph-structured chemical representations that optimize user-defined objectives by efficiently navigating a physically constrained domain.

METHODS Prospective study comparing three different pulse oximeters: Masimo Radical-7 compared simultaneously with Ohmeda Biox 3700 or with Nellcor N395, in newborn infants who required resuscitation. Members of the research team placed the sensors for each of the pulse oximeters being compared simultaneously, one sensor on each foot of the same baby. Care provided routinely, without interference by the research team. The time elapsed until a reliable SpO2 was obtained was recorded using a digital chronometer. Statistical comparisons included chi-square and student's T-test. RESULTS Thirty-two infants were enrolled; median gestational age 32 weeks. Seventeen paired measurements were made with the Radical-7 and Biox 3700; mean time to a stable reading was 20.27 sec for the Radical-7 and 74.212 sec for the Biox 3700 (p=0.02). The Radical-7 and the N- 395 were paired on 15 infants; the times to obtain a stable reading were 20.94 sec and 67.312 sec, respectively (p=0.03). CONCLUSION The time to a reliable reading obtained simultaneously in neonatal critical situations differs by the type of the pulse oximeter used, being significantly faster with Masimo Signal Extraction Technology.

The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to na?ve cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.","output":"Pathogenesis, transmission and response to re-exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nearly half of children meeting criteria for a mental health disorder in the United States (U.S.) do not receive the treatment they need.

This research aimed to explore the ability of the final-year medical students to assist during COVID-19 in a war-torn health system. Methods: : Final-year medical students in Syrian Universities were approached between 9 th -17 th April 2020 through an online questionnaire that assessed the students COVID-19-related medical knowledge (5-point score), clinical judgment (5-point score), preparedness and willingness to integrate in the healthcare facilities. An overall score of 10 points was built and multivariate analysis was conducted. Results: : A total of 1764 responses were received. Valid responses were (1673) with 1199 (71.66%) responses from the final-year students. Of the latter, 728 (60.71%) scored 4 points or higher in the medical knowledge score (mean 3.69 points [SD 0.96]), while 298 (24.85%) scored 4 or higher in the clinical judgment score. Final-year students scored significantly higher than the fourth-year students in the clinical judgment score (mean 2.69 points [SD 1.12] vs 2.47 [1.15];adjusted P=0.012). Nearly 72.4% of the final-year participants had an overall score of 7 points or more out of 10 (mean 6.39 points [SD 1.57]).

Evolutionary and psychological research has shown that touch is an important part of bond-building and emotion communication; loneliness is intimately related to these elements as well. In this paper, we ask whether physical contact reduces feelings of loneliness which might derive from evolutionary ancient bonding mechanismsdespite a cultural context that is relatively non-tactile. METHOD: An experimental study (40 participants, 13 males) tested for observable effects of touch on loneliness scores in a low-contact culture to analyse whether they respond positively to that stimulus despite cultural training against it. RESULTS: Participants exposed to physical contact reported significantly lower neglect scores from their close relationships in a short loneliness scale, thus suggesting that there is an underlying mechanism that persists despite enculturation. The effects were particularly strong among single people, which could mean that lower loneliness among married people might be partly explained by the regular availability of physical contact. Participants in the experimental condition also showed a faster reduction in heart rate, interpreted as a sign of physiological wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings help to specify mechanisms within the evolutionary theoretical framework of loneliness that link internal feelings to environmental cues.

The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection, multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment strategies is mandatory in such cases.","output":"Successful management of a patient with active Cushing?'?s disease complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mosquito-borne diseases in Queensland, Australia, during the first half of 2020.

We propose that limitations on human movement likely resulted in the majority of RRV infections being acquired at or near the place of residence, and that an increase in outdoor activities, such as gardening and bushwalking in the local household vicinity, increased risk of exposure to RRV-infected mosquitoes. In contrast, the precipitous decline in international passenger flights led to a reduction in the number of imported dengue and malaria cases of over 70% and 60%, respectively, compared with the previous five years. This substantial reduction in flights also reduced a risk pathway for importation of exotic mosquitoes, but the risk posed by importation via sea cargo was not affected.

Heparin, a pharmacologically important version of HS, having higher sulfation and a higher content of iduronic acid than HS, is a widely used clinical anticoagulant. However, due to their heterogeneity and complex structure, HS and heparin are very challenging to analyze, limiting biological studies and even resulting in safety concerns in their therapeutic application. Therefore, reliable methods of structural analysis of HS and heparin are critically needed. In addition to the structural analysis of heparin, its concentration in blood needs to be closely monitored to avoid complications such as thrombocytopenia or hemorrhage caused by heparin overdose. This review summarizes the progress in biotechnological approaches in the structural characterization of HS and heparin over the past decade and includes the development of the ultrasensitive approaches for detection and measurement in biological samples.","output":"Recent advances in biotechnology for heparin and heparan sulfate analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has challenged healthcare systems across the world, restricting resources for major hepato-pancreato-biliary resections. We report the experience of a unique temporising measure to overcome unavailability of upfront surgery, for select patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (rPDAC) during the pandemic. METHODS: Select patients with rPDAC who were assessed to be unsuitable for, or declined, upfront systemic chemotherapy, were considered for hypofractionated radiotherapy (hypoRT) as bridging therapy to Whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy. RESULTS: Three patients with EUS-biopsy confirmed rPDAC with no vascular involvement received 5 fractions of hypoRT followed by Whipples resection. Median patient age was 68 (range 63-77). All patients successfully completed hypoRT, with one case of transient grade 2 anorexia. Median interval from hypoRT to resection was 75 days (range 41-95 days), with median operative time including anaesthesia of 573 minutes (range 496-661 minutes). R0 resection was achieved in two cases, including one requiring portal vein resection. R1 resection was seen in one patient who required superior mesenteric vein resection. One patient experienced complication in the form of delayed gastric emptying. Median length of stay was 11 days (range 11-58 days). No patient experienced post-operative pancreatic fistula, and no patient has evidence of recurrence on 30-day follow up imaging. CONCLUSION: This report provides initial experience for hypoRT in select patients with rPDAC prior to resection. Further work is required to quantify outcomes and long-term safety profile of this novel approach.

The papain-like protease (PLpro), which is released from nsp3, is presently being evaluated as a significant anti-viral drug target for COVID-19 therapy development. Particularly, PLpro is implicated in the cleavage of viral polyproteins and antagonizes the host innate immune response through its deubiquitinating and deISGylating actions, thus making it a high-profile antiviral therapeutic target. The present study reports a few specific food compounds that can bind tightly with the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein identified through extensive computational screening techniques. Precisely, extensive advanced computational approaches combining target-based virtual screening, particularly employing sub-structure based similarity search, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM-GBSA based binding free energy calculations have been employed for the identification of the most promising food compounds with substantial functional implications as SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein inhibitors/modulators. Observations from the present research investigation also provide a deeper understanding of the binding modes of the proposed four food compounds with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein. In docking analyses, all compounds have established essential inter-molecular interaction profiles at the active site cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein. Similarly, the long-range 100 ns conventional MD simulation studies also provided an in-depth understanding of probable interactions and dynamic behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein-food compound complexes. Binding free energies of all molecular systems revealed a strong interaction affinity of food compounds towards the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein.

Improving public knowledge of COVID-19 is critical to controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to determine Chinas public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over 48 h from 22:30 29 February 2020 to 22:30 2 March 2020 based on a self-administered web-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted on the WeChat network. Exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling was applied. The questionnaire was voluntarily completed by WeChat users. The questionnaire covered basic demographic information, public knowledge of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, psychological state, and attitudes towards the overall control measures. The primary outcome was the Chinas public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures and secondary outcome was the psychological state of the public during this pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 10,905 participants and 10,399 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. Participants with tertiary education, younger participants and healthcare workers had better overall knowledge than other participants (all P < 0.05). Approximately 91.9% of the participants believed in person-to-person transmission and 39.1% believed in animal-to-person transmission. No significant correlation between anxiety and the number of regional existing confirmed cases was found, while participants in Hubei were more anxious than those in other regions. In general, 74.1% of the participants acknowledged the effectiveness of the overall control measures, and the percentage of participants with agreement with the overall control measures was negatively correlated with the number of regional existing confirmed cases (r = ? 0.492, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the survey revealed that the Chinese public had overall good knowledge of COVID-19 except for those indeterminate knowledges. With dynamic changes in the global pandemic situation and more research, further studies should be conducted to explore changes in public knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 in the future.

A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. METHODS: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. RESULTS: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Normozoospermic semen samples were used to validate the co-staining consisting of Acridine Orange (AO) and LIVE/DEAD? Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (LD), against established methods for the evaluation of cell viability, propidium iodide stain (PI), and DNA fragmentation, the Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA), to rule out cross-interference. Furthermore, the accuracy of the method was tested by the evaluation of samples prepared with different amounts of membrane and DNA damage (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%). RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the co-staining and the established staining procedures (membrane integrity, P = 0.755; DNA fragmentation P = 0.976). Moreover, high R square values were obtained from the analysis of samples of known membrane (R2 = 0.9959) and DNA damage (R2 = 0.9843).

Routine histopathological examinations and immunohistochemical staining suffer from a relatively low resolution of light microscopy, whereas the fluorescence imaging of plaques and bioprosthetic heart valves yields considerable background noise from the convoluted extracellular matrix that often results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Besides, the sectioning of calcified or stent-expanded blood vessels or mineralised heart valves leads to a critical loss of their integrity, demanding other methods to be developed. Here, we designed a conceptually novel approach that combines conventional formalin fixation, sequential incubation in heavy metal solutions (osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate or lanthanides, and lead citrate), and the embedding of the whole specimen into epoxy resin to retain its integrity while accessing the region of interest by grinding and polishing. Upon carbon sputtering, the sample is visualised by means of backscattered scanning electron microscopy. The technique fully preserves calcified and stent-expanded tissues, permits a detailed analysis of vascular and valvular composition and architecture, enables discrimination between multiple cell types (including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, mast cells, foam cells, foreign-body giant cells, canonical macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and microvascular identities (arterioles, venules, and capillaries), and gives a technical possibility for quantitating the number, area, and density of the blood vessels.

To accelerate research studies, we developed microbiome sequencing protocols, including amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, directly from patient samples at health care facilities with ongoing C. auris outbreaks. We characterized the skin mycobiome with a database optimized to classify Candida species and C. auris to the clade level. While Malassezia species were the predominant skin-associated fungi, nursing home residents also harbored Candida species, including C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis. Amplicon sequencing was concordant with culturing studies to identify C. auris-colonized patients and provided further resolution that distinct clades of C. auris are colonizing facilities in New York and Illinois.

Aims This study aimed to develop and evaluate a knowledge and attitudes questionnaire on MERS coronavirus for Iranian nurses. Methods A questionnaire was developed based on international and national guidelines and a literature review. Ten nurses were recruited to assess face validity and 11 experts reviewed the instrument to determine the content validity ratio and index. Exploratory factor analysis was then done with a random sample of 155 nurses in Tabriz city, Islamic Republic of Iran. Results Following determination of face and content validity, 78 items (61 knowledge and 17 attitude) were retained in the final version of the questionnaire. The knowledge scale had an average content validity index of 0.80 and the attitude scale a value of 0.91. In the exploratory factor analysis, five dimensions with eigenvalues > 1 and loading level  0.4 were extracted for the knowledge scale (46 items) and two for the attitude scale (16 items). The Kuder-Richardson 21 coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient for the knowledge scale were 0.94 and 0.91 respectively. In the attitude scale, the Cronbach alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.82 and 0.89 respectively.

Current cancer treatment strategies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have been seriously restricted by their side effects and low efficiency for a long time, which urges us to develop new technologies for more effective and much safer anticancer therapies. Novel nanotechnologies, based on different kinds of functional nanomaterials, have been proved to act as effective and promising strategies for anticancer treatment. Based on the important biological roles of cobalt, cobalt oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely developed for their attractive biomedical applications, especially their potential for anticancer treatments due to their selective inhibition of cancer cells. Thus, more and more attention has been attracted to the preparation, characterization and anticancer investigation of cobalt oxide nanoparticles in recent years, which is expected to introduce novel anticancer treatment strategies. In this review, we summarize the synthesis methods of cobalt oxide nanoparticles to discuss the advantages and restrictions for their preparation.

One-third (33%) of CYP reported improved mental wellbeing during the first UK national lockdown. Compared with peers who reported no change or deterioration, a higher proportion of CYP with improved mental wellbeing reported improved relationships with friends and family, less loneliness and exclusion, reduced bullying, better management of school tasks, and more sleep and exercise during lockdown.

During the outbreak of a novel virus, estimating early a reliable ICU_ALOS estimate of infected patients is critical to accurately parameterize models examining mitigation and preparedness scenarios. Methods: Two estimation methods of ICU ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n=59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods' patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. Findings: LOS [] 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95%CI) at 13.0 days (10.4, 15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1, 29.7), respectively. Series' true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date. Interpretation: Discharges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak.

Methods A convenience sample of smokers at 2 Pennsylvania hospital EDs who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were approached to participate in a brief intervention known as screening, treatment initiation, and referral (STIR) counseling that included phone follow-up. Demographic information, current smoking status, and specific physician prescription and follow-up recommendations were collected. Approximately 3 months later, patients were contacted to determine current smoking status and actions taken since their ED visit. Results One hundred six patients were approached and 7 (6.6%) opted out of the intervention. Patients who did not opt out were evaluated for appropriate use of smoking cessation-related medications; 35 (35.4%) opted out of the prescription(s) and 6 (6.1%) were not indicated. Twenty-one (21.2%) patients opted out of ambulatory referral follow-ups with primary care and/or tobacco treatment program; one (1.0%) was not indicated for referral.

Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words, projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and development.","output":"Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of COVID-19 outbreak severity with the use of meta-projections based on Richards' curve parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We contend that the exclusive focus on the English language in scientific research might hinder effective communication between scientists and practitioners or policy makers whose mother tongue is non-English. This barrier in scientific knowledge and data transfer likely leads to significant knowledge gaps and may create biases when providing global patterns in many fields of science. To demonstrate this, we compiled data on the global economic costs of invasive alien species reported in 15 non-English languages. We compared it with equivalent data from English documents (i.e., the InvaCost database, the most up-to-date repository of invasion costs globally). The comparison of both databases (~7500 entries in total) revealed that non-English sources: (i) capture a greater amount of data than English sources alone (2500 vs. 2396 cost entries respectively); (ii) add 249 invasive species and 15 countries to those reported by English literature, and (iii) increase the global cost estimate of invasions by 16.6% (i.e., US$ 214 billion added to 1.288 trillion estimated from the English database). Additionally, 2712 cost entries - not directly comparable to the English database - were directly obtained from practitioners, revealing the value of communication between scientists and practitioners. Moreover, we demonstrated how gaps caused by overlooking non-English data resulted in significant biases in the distribution of costs across space, taxonomic groups, types of cost, and impacted sectors. Specifically, costs from Europe, at the local scale, and particularly pertaining to management, were largely under-represented in the English database. Thus, combining scientific data from English and non-English sources proves fundamental and enhances data completeness. Considering non-English sources helps alleviate biases in understanding invasion costs at a global scale. Finally, it also holds strong potential for improving management performance, coordination among experts (scientists and practitioners), and collaborative actions across countries.

Several countries have implemented an extended interval of up to 12 weeks between first and second vaccine doses to increase population coverage after single administration. Methods: Spike-specific immune responses that were induced following single administration of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 were studied in 89 staff and 35 residents within LTCFs. Quantitative antibody and cellular responses were determined as well as antibody inhibition of spike protein-ACE2 binding from viral variants. Results: 20% of staff and 34% of residents were found to have serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and all of these donors demonstrated strong antibody responses that were independent of age. Antibody responses were detectable within 99% and 79% of infection-naive staff and residents respectively but were 8.2-fold lower within residents. This effect resulted from slower kinetics of antibody generation within residents which reached levels comparable to staff after only 42 days. In contrast spike-specific cellular responses were equivalent between both groups. Antibody inhibition activity against the B.1.351 and P.1 viral variants of concern was low using serum from infection-naive older donors. Prior history of natural infection thus has a marked impact on the magnitude and quality of antibody response after a single Covid-19 vaccine in care home residents.

High-speed dynamic radiography was utilized to determine tibiotalar range of motion in the sagittal plane during nonweightbearing (NWB) and weightbearing (WB) gait in a shoe (control), SLC, and low and high fracture boots. Sensors captured peak plantar surface forces to determine ankle offloading. RESULTS In NWB, the low fracture boot (2.2  2.0 degrees), high fracture boot (2.3  1.6 degrees), and SLC (2.3  1.5 degrees) had significantly less motion compared with the control (3.6  2.1 degrees; P  .026). During WB, the SLC (3.4  1.4 degrees) and high fracture boot (4.8  2.0 degrees) had less motion compared with the low fracture boot (7.8  3.4 degrees; P < .001).

Methods and findings From 17-November-2020 to 5-January-2021, 803 inpatients and 329 staff were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection across four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK. We classified cases according to epidemiological definitions, sought epidemiological evidence of a potential source for each nosocomial infection, and evaluated if epidemiologically-linked cases had genomic evidence supporting transmission. We compared epidemiological and genomic outbreak identification. Using national epidemiological definitions, 109/803(14%) inpatient infections were classified as definite/probable nosocomial, 615(77%) as community-acquired and 79(10%) as indeterminate. There was strong epidemiological evidence to support definite/probable cases as nosocomial: 107/109(98%) had a prior-negative PCR in the same hospital stay before testing positive, and 101(93%) shared time and space with known infected patients/staff. Many indeterminate cases were likely infected in hospital: 53/79(67%) had a prior-negative PCR and 75(95%) contact with a potential source. 89/615(11% of all 803 patients) with apparent community-onset had a recent hospital exposure. WGS highlighted SARS-CoV-2 is mainly imported into hospitals: within 764 samples sequenced 607 genomic clusters were identified (>1 SNP distinct). Only 43/607(7%) clusters contained evidence of onward transmission (subsequent cases within 1 SNP). 20/21 epidemiologically-identified outbreaks contained multiple genomic introductions. Most (80%) nosocomial acquisition occurred in rapid super-spreading events in settings with a mix of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Hospitals not routinely admitting COVID-19 patients had low rates of transmission. Undiagnosed/unsequenced individuals prevent genomic data from excluding nosocomial acquisition.

METHODS: From March 6 to March 22, 2020, 130 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled for this single-center analysis and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%; 1, < 5%; 2:5-25%; 3:26-50%; 4:51-75%; 5, > 75%; range 0-5; global score 0-25). Data were matched with clinical stages and laboratory findings. Survival curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CT score as a predictor of patients' outcome. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities were predominant in early-phase (&#8804; 7 days since symptoms' onset), while crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis characterized late-phase disease (> 7 days). CT score was significantly higher in critical and severe than in mild stage (p < 0.0001), and among late-phase than early-phase patients (p < 0.0001). CT score was significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6204) and D-dimer (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6625) levels.

Energy intake decreased during lockdown (p = 0.002) and returned to baseline post-lockdown. Despite lower physical activity levels during lockdown (p = 0.035), we observed no significant changes in body composition. However, we observed a significant increase in serum glucose (p = 0.005), total cholesterol (p = 0.003), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.049) post-lockdown. Increase in serum glucose levels was pronounced in subjects with higher increase in energy intake (p = 0.039), increased omega-6 fatty acids intake (p = 0.016), those who were exposed to several risky contacts (p = 0.018, compared to those with less risky contacts) and those who were not active in nature (p = 0.008, compared to those active in nature). Increased serum LDL was correlated to decreased monounsaturated fatty acids intake (p = 0.028).

MATERIALS: This study aims to assess the mental health of health professionals at a critical point in their workload, to compare the results with those the general population, and to explore the potential determinants affecting it. The CAWI survey includes a sociodemographic section, work experience and a standardised psychometric tool (GHQ-28). Data were collected during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (3-29 November 2020), which had the highest mortality rates and SARS-CoV-2 morbidity rates, as well as during the period of a significant increase in deaths, compared to the corresponding pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: A total of 2150 surveys were eligible for analysis. Among them, 848 (39.4%) were active health professionals. In the analysis of the scores of the GHQ-28 scale and its sub-scales, evaluating anxiety/insomnia and somatic symptoms, medical workers scored significantly higher scores than non-medical professions (p < 0.001). Frontline medical workers (p < 0.001) and those who were forcibly seconded to work with COVID-19-infected patients (p = 0.011) achieved significantly higher GHQ-28 scores. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental deterioration among health professionals, especially among those directly working with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and those who were forcibly seconded to work with such patients.

Therefore, a minimal continuous cuff pressure must be maintained. Aim of this study was to analyse the course of cuff pressure in an in-vitro model during manual cuff pressure control manoeuvres. METHODS An artificial trachea was intubated with an appropriately sized ETT and cuff pressure set to 20 cm H2 O. Thirty-two experienced ICU nurses each performed six cuff pressure control manoeuvres (three times in two different ETTs) using a manual cuff pressure manometer. Course of cuff pressure from connecting the manometer to disconnecting it from the cuff pilot balloon was recorded using a pressure transducer. RESULTS There were 190 cuff pressure control manoeuvres suitable for analysis. In all control manoeuvres a cuff pressure below 20 cm H2 O was noted. In 20.0% of the control manoeuvres the cuff pressure dropped below 10 cm H2 O. Cuff pressure drops were mainly caused by initially connecting the manometer to the pilot balloon, less frequently by manipulating the pressure gauge of the manometer. Disconnecting the manometer after the control manoeuvre caused a cuff pressure drop in 78.1% of cases, contributing to a final cuff pressure below 20 cm H2 O in 31.3% of control manoeuvres. CONCLUSION Routine manual cuff pressure control manoeuvres in ETT cuffs result in considerable cuff pressure drops. This may have an impact on silent aspiration of pharyngeal contents passing along the cuff into the lower airway.","output":"Endotracheal tube cuff pressure changes during manual cuff pressure control manoeuvres: An in-vitro assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the chondroprotective effect and influence of N,N-bis(1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3-oxopyrazol-4-yl) sebacamide (dpdo) that was synthesized through the reaction of phenazone with sebacoyl chloride and screened for its biological activity especially as anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory agent in a monoiodoacetate (MA)-induced experimental osteoarthritis (OA) model. Thirty male albino rats weighing 190C200 g were divided randomly into three groups (10 each): control, MA-induced OA, and MA-induced OA + dpdo. In MA-induced OA rat, the tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, reactive oxygen species, as well as all the mitochondrial markers such as mitochondria membrane potential, swelling mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and serum oxidative/antioxidant status (malondialdehyde level and activities of myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase) are elevated. Also, the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), levels of ATP, the level of glutathione (GSH), and thiol were markedly diminished in the MA-induced OA group compared to the normal control rats. These findings showed that mitochondrial function is associated with OA pathophysiological alterations and high gene expressions of (IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b) and suggests a promising use of dpdo as potential ameliorative agents in the animal model of OA and could act as anti-inflammatory agent in case of severe infection with COVID-19.

High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality. RESULTS: We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.

Patients with hip fractures, due to their age and comorbidity, were high-risk patients in this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to observe how the pandemic affected the management of hip fractures in elderly patients. Methods This is a descriptive, retrospective study of all patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with a hip fracture that came to the emergency room of Vall dHebron University Hospital in the COVID-19 pandemic period, from the 11th of March to the 24th of April 2020. They were followed up during their hospital stay and 30 days after the fracture. Results A total of 63 patients were included, 18 (28.6%) of whom had a positive RT-qPCR for COVID-19. Four could not be operated on due to the severity of the disease they presented with upon admission, dying a few days afterwards. Three of these patients had COVID-19. The 83.3% of the patients with positive RT-qPCR presented respiratory symptoms during their hospitalization. The length of hospital stays of patients with a positive RT-qPCR (18.258.99 days) was longer than that of patients that were RT-qPCR negative (10.94.52 days) (P =.01). In-hospital mortality in operated patients was 20% in patients with a positive RT-qPCR, compared with 2.3% in the group of patients who tested negative (P =.018).

Domestic abuse helplines therefore became an increasingly vital avenue for victim support, seeing a substantial increase in service demand during lockdown periods. Method: Through semi-structured interviews with 11 domestic abuse helpline workers across UK services dedicated to a diverse range of populations, this project examined the nature and frequency of calls received since the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Results: Key themes identified through thematic analysis were: 1) Abusers weaponising government guidelines to justify and intensify abuse, and restrictions acting as both a barrier and facilitator to leaving an abusive relationship;2) A loss of previously accessed support, with users uncertain about what help was available and issues around engaging with new forms of support;and 3) Isolation from social support networks, with callers reporting a loss of respite, lack of emotional and practical support, removal of third-party abuse monitoring opportunities, and subsequent mental health implications.

DESIGN A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a control condition with regular food prices (n 152), an SSB tax condition (n 130), and a nutrient profiling tax condition based on Nutri-Score (n 112). Participants completed a weekly grocery shop for their household. Primary outcome measures were SSB purchases (ordinal variable) and the overall healthiness of the total shopping basket (proportion of total unit food items classified as healthy). The secondary outcome measure was the energy (kcal) content of the total shopping basket. Data were analysed using regression analyses. SETTING Three-dimensional virtual supermarket. PARTICIPANTS Dutch adults aged 18 years being responsible for grocery shopping in their household (n 394). RESULTS The SSB tax (OR=1.62, 95%CI 1.03, 2.54) and the nutrient profiling tax (OR=1.88, 95%CI 1.17, 3.02) increased the likelihood of being in a lower-level category of SSB purchases. The overall healthiness of the total shopping basket was higher (+2.7 percent point; 95%CI 0.1, 5.3) and the energy content was lower (-3,301 kcal; 95%CI -6,425, -177) for participants in the nutrient profiling tax condition than for those in the control condition. The SSB tax did not affect the overall healthiness and energy content of the total shopping basket (P>0.05).

Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. OBJECTIVE: We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. METHODS: Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. RESULTS: All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial.

Materials and Methods In September 2017, we invited national stakeholders in stem cell donor recruitment to participate in a Facebook group and regular e-meetings. E-meetings involved speakers and roundtable discussion on topics related to donor recruitment. The Facebook group facilitated sharing of resources. We evaluated stakeholder perspective of the CoP and the impact on recruitment outcomes. Results As of December 2020, the CoP included 382 members who published 243 posts to the Facebook group about patient/donor stories (40%), resources (27%), updates/questions (21%) and recruitment outcomes (12%). In January 2020, we surveyed 44 CoP participants; the majority felt that the Facebook group (86%) and e-meetings (59%) supported the community, and that the CoP fostered collaboration (82%), improved their donor recruitment knowledge (75%) and practice (77%) and improved their ability to recruit needed donors (64%). The launch of the CoP correlated with improved donor recruitment outcomes.

This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) may be the primary factor related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum and the risk for mortality, as subclinical nutritional deficiencies may be unmasked by any significant increase in oxidative stress. NAD(+) levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19. Further consumption of NAD(+) in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1. This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD(+) and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically. The significance of this, if proven, has far-reaching consequences in the management of COVID-19 especially in third world countries, where resources and finances are limited.","output":"COVID-19: NAD(+) deficiency may predispose the aged, obese and type2 diabetics to mortality through its effect on SIRT1 activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helminth infections have large negative impacts on production efficiency in ruminant farming systems worldwide, and their effective management is essential if livestock production is to increase to meet future human needs for dietary protein.

Here, we present a vision of helminth control in farmed ruminants by 2030, bringing to bear progress in: (1) diagnostic tools, (2) innovative control approaches based on vaccines and selective breeding, (3) anthelmintics, by sustainable use of existing products and potentially new compounds, and (4) rational integration of future control practices. In this review, we identify the technical advances that we believe will place new tools in the hands of animal health decision makers in 2030, to enhance their options for control and allow them to achieve a more integrated and sustainable approach to helminth control in support of animal welfare and production.","output":"Control of helminth ruminant infections by 2030."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.

Hepatitis A (HA) is caused by acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and was once very common in China. Following the 2008 introduction of the HA vaccine into the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the incidence of reported HA in China decreased markedly. However, HA epidemics still occur in Liaoning Province every 3C5 years, although with far fewer cases than in the pre-HA-vaccination era. What is added by this report? Between January 1, 2020 and March 18, 2020, the number of reported cases of HA in Dalian and Dandong cities of Liaoning Province increased significantly compared with the same period in previous years. All cases were sporadic, and cases were seen in nearly every township. The increase in HA occurred one month after local fresh seafood became available with most cases being among adults. A case-control study showed that consuming raw or undercooked seafood, clams, snapping shrimp, and oysters were significantly associated with the increase in HA. What are the implications for public health practices? Strengthening health education for residents to avoid consumption of raw seafood and encouraging HAV vaccination of adults aged 20 to 54 years are important to prevent periodic HAV endemic outbreaks.

Methods: Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center (ADSCC) proposed a prospective clinical trial nebulization treatment with autologous stem cells (Non-Hematopoietic Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (NHPBSC)), at Abu Dhabi hospitals. Participants: 20 treated patients were compared with 23 not treated patients. Both groups received COVID 19 standard treatment. Outcomes: After the results were collected, this study was created to determine the impact of the disease on the renal function and the efficacy of the therapy on patients outcomes. Results: One third of the critical patients studied suffered kidney failure. Patients in the treated group showed a favorable tendency to improve in contrast to those in the control group.

In this sense, machine learning techniques have been employed to examine CBC data and aid in screening patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, we used machine learning to compare CBC data between two highly genetically distinguished Latin American countries: Brazil and Ecuador. We notice a clear distribution pattern of positive and negative cases between the two countries. Interestingly, almost all red blood cell count parameters were divergent. For males, neutrophils and lymphocytes are distinct between Brazil and Ecuador, while eosinophils are distinguished for females. Finally, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes displayed a particular distribution for both genders.

While inactivation of infectious agents facilitates the use of less stringent safety conditions, its effect on other biological entities of interest present in the sample is generally unknown. Here, we analyzed the effect of five inactivation methods (heat, ethanol, formaldehyde, psoralen, and TRIzol) on microbiome composition and diversity in samples collected from four different body sites (gut, nasal, oral, and skin) and compared them against untreated samples from the same tissues. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and estimated abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa present in all samples. Nasal and skin samples were the most affected by inactivation, with ethanol and TRIzol inducing the largest changes in composition, and heat, formaldehyde, TRIzol, and psoralen inducing the largest changes in diversity. Oral and stool microbiomes were more robust to inactivation, with no significant changes in diversity and only moderate changes in composition. Firmicutes was the taxonomic group least affected by inactivation, while Bacteroidetes had a notable enrichment in nasal samples and moderate enrichment in fecal and oral samples. Actinobacteria were more notably depleted in fecal and skin samples, and Proteobacteria exhibited a more variable behavior depending on sample type and inactivation method. Overall, our results demonstrate that inactivation methods can alter the microbiome in a tissue-specific manner and that careful consideration should be given to the choice of method based on the sample type under study. IMPORTANCE Understanding how viral infections impact and are modulated by the microbiome is an important problem in basic research but is also of high clinical relevance under the current pandemic. To facilitate the study of interactions between microbial communities and pathogenic viruses under safe conditions, the infectious agent is generally inactivated prior to processing samples. The effect of this inactivation process in the microbiome is, however, unknown. Further, it is unclear whether biases introduced by inactivation methods are dependent on the sample type under study. Estimating the magnitude and nature of the changes induced by different methods in samples collected from various body sites thus provides important information for current and future studies that require inactivation of pathogenic agents.","output":"Viral Inactivation Impacts Microbiome Estimates in a Tissue-Specific Manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aminopeptidase N (APN) represents a class of zinc metallopeptidases with broad substrate specifity.

METHODS Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we estimated the number of childhood cancer survivors on December 31, 2016 for each childhood cancer diagnosis, multiplied this by the proportion of carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study, and projected the resulting number onto the U.S. POPULATION RESULTS Based on genome sequence data, 11.8% of 2450 SJLIFE participants carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of 156 cancer predisposition genes. Given this information, we estimate that 21 800 adult survivors of childhood cancer in the United States carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes. The highest estimated absolute number of variant carriers are among survivors of central nervous system tumors (n = 4300), particularly astrocytoma (n = 1800) and other gliomas (n = 1700), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4300), and retinoblastoma (n = 3500). The most frequently mutated genes are RB1 (n = 3000), NF1 (n = 2300), and BRCA2 (n = 800).

The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with high GV in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective, observational study done at three different sites included 685 consecutive patients with DM hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to December 2020. Demographic characteristics, DM history, comorbidities, laboratory and COVID-19 treatment data were collected. All blood glucose levels, by laboratory serum measurement or by point-of-care testing were collected for the entire hospital stay. GV was expressed as the percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), derived from the following formula: ([SD of glucose] / [mean glucose]) x 100. High GV was defined as %CV  36%. We used elastic-net regression model (R version 4.1.0, package glmnet) to select the most important covariates affecting GV of the cohort. Out of the potential 34 variables, 13 had nonzero coefficients and were included in a logistic regression model with high GV as a dependent variable. Results: A total of 685 hospitalized patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 67.414.1, mean BMI of 32.28.3, median (IQR) hemoglobin A1c of 7.4 (6.6-9.0), 323 (47.2%) were male and 425 (62%) were African-American race.

An AHP analysis was first performed within the SWOT frame, and then a TOWS analysis was conducted using the results of the SWOT-AHP analysis. In the AHP analysis, the number of pairwise comparison questions was limited to four for each SWOT factor to increase the consistency of responses by reducing the burden on respondents. Findings - The plunge in demand (threats factor) has had an overwhelming impact on the MICE industry, more than any other environmental factor. To overcome the crisis, the ST alternative that takes advantage of dynamic pop culture to minimize the business damage caused by the plunge in demand was the top priority measure. Based on the results, this study presents suggestions for overcoming the crisis in the MICE industry. First, the industry should develop profitable business models to supplement scarce financial resources by exploiting Korea's success with quarantine management. Second, the government must provide emergency relief funds or bailout support to protect MICE facilities and employees.

However, there is concern that COVID-19 infection may lead to long-term sequelae, including pulmonary defects, cardiac complications, blood clots, and neurocognitive impairment. This study describes the 30-day outcomes of patients who had recovered. METHODS: From 3/16/2020 to 5/19/2020, a follow-up was attempted for patients who were discharged alive from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and had recovered. Recovery was defined as being alive 30 days post symptom-onset. A telephone survey was conducted 30 days post-index admission and recorded in electronic medical records. Oxygen (O2) requirements, symptoms, readmissions and the need for antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections were evaluated. RESULTS: 585 patients met inclusion criteria and were contacted by phone; 303 answered their phone (Table 1), but only 266 (45%) completed a full telephone encounter and were included in the final analysis (Table 2). The majority were female (53%), black (80%), and discharged to home (84%). The clinical characteristics of those who completed the survey were as follows: 11% presented with O2 saturation < 90%, 16% had underlying lung pathology, and 57% had a BMI above 30. Patients average age was 61  14.3 years. At 30 days post-index admission, 49% were still symptomatic. Of the symptomatic patients, 86% had dyspnea on exertion and 15% required O2 supplementation. 18% of patients were readmitted within 30 days, and 9% developed a secondary infection prior to the phone encounter.

Setting and Participants AL/RC communities in the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program that had  1 on-site vaccination clinic during December 18, 2020 C April 21, 2021. Methods We estimated uptake by using the cumulative number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered and normalizing by the number of AL/RC community beds. We estimated the percentage of residents vaccinated in three states using AL census counts. We linked community vaccine administration data with county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) measures to calculate median vaccine uptake by SVI tertile. Results In AL communities, a median of 67 residents (IQR: 48C90) and 32 staff members (IQR: 15C60) per 100 beds received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the first on-site clinic; in RC, a median of 8 residents (IQR: 5C10) and 5 staff members (IQR: 2C12) per 10 beds received a first dose.

Besides its roles as the histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor and the ligand for G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 109a, the influence of butyrate on the glucose metabolism of cancerous colonocytes and the underlying molecular mechanism are not fully understood. Here, we show that butyrate markedly inhibited glucose transport and glycolysis of colorectal cancer cells, through reducing the abundance of membrane GLUT1 and cytoplasmic G6PD, which was regulated by the GPR109a-AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, butyrate significantly promoted the chemotherapeutical efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on cancerous colonocytes, with exacerbated impairment of DNA synthesis efficiency. Our findings provide useful information to better understand the molecular basis for the impact of butyrate on the glucose metabolism of colorectal cancer cells, which would promote the development of beneficial metabolites of gut microbiota as therapeutical or adjuvant anti-cancer drugs.","output":"Butyrate Suppresses Glucose Metabolism of Colorectal Cancer Cells via GPR109a-AKT Signaling Pathway and Enhances Chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic control may be hampered when the percentage of asymptomatic cases is high. To estimate whether test positivity may assist in policy-making, it was explored in the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six Latin American countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March, 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals recorded on a given day out of all individuals tested on the same day. The epidemic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) was first analyzed to evaluate TP as well as: (i) the daily ratio of secondary over primary infections (apparent reproductive ratio or ARR); (ii) tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI), (iii) the temporal data on the number of active cases (all test-positive cases minus deaths and recovered patients), and (iv) that of recovered patients. Later, significant patterns identified in the first step were assessed in the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated that (i) TP was positively correlated with the ARR (r=.92, p<0.01); (ii) TP informed more than the ARR: while major data departures revealed by the ARR were also detected by TP, TP exhibited patterns not shown by ARR; and (iii) three temporal stages were observed, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (P<0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationships between TPMI and TP. The six Latin American countries showed that TP was positively correlated with deaths/million inhabitants or DMI (r=.62, p<0.01). The temporal analysis of policies revealed four patterns: (1) low testing and high DMI, (2) high testing and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high testing and high DMI (where isolation was not pursued). Findings support the hypothesis that test positivity may inform as much as, if not more than classic metrics, such as the TPMI. If complemented with high-resolution geographical data, these indicators could inform policy-makers when and where epidemic control measures are or are not successful. .","output":"Test positivity - evaluation of a new metric to assess epidemic dispersal mediated by non-symptomatic cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic drives the need for Intelligent Process Automation (IPA).

In this Health Policy paper, we synthesise the evidence related to interventions that can reduce premature mortality from the major NCDs over the next decade and that are feasible to implement in countries at all levels of income. Our recommendations are intended as generic guidance to help 123 low-income and middle-income countries meet SDG target 3.4; country-level applications require additional analyses and consideration of the local implementation and utilisation context. Protecting current investments and scaling up these interventions is especially crucial in the context of COVID-19-related health system disruptions. We show how cost-effectiveness data and other information can be used to define locally tailored packages of interventions to accelerate rates of decline in NCD mortality. Under realistic implementation constraints, most countries could achieve (or almost achieve) the NCD target using a combination of these interventions; the greatest gains would be for cardiovascular disease mortality. Implementing the most efficient package of interventions in each world region would require, on average, an additional US$18 billion annually over 2023C30; this investment could avert 39 million deaths and generate an average net economic benefit of $27 trillion, or $390 per capita. Although specific clinical intervention pathways would vary across countries and regions, policies to reduce behavioural risks, such as tobacco smoking, harmful use of alcohol, and excess sodium intake, would be relevant in nearly every country, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the health gains of any locally tailored NCD package. By 2030, ministries of health would need to contribute about 20% of their budgets to high-priority NCD interventions.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted systems can come into play to help visualize the publics awareness of mask wearing and gain a better picture of whether there is adequate practice of protection during the outbreak. We reported the rate of face mask wearing by the general public using the artificial intelligence-assisted face mask detector, AiMASK. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 23 and April 22, 2021 in over 32 districts in Bangkok, Thailand. After the introduction of AiMASK, development and internal validation were performed, and average accuracy of 97.8% was found. Data were classified into a protected group (correct face mask wearing) and an unprotected group (incorrect or non-mask wearing). We analyzed the association between factors affecting the unprotected group using univariate logistic regression analysis. Results: : No significant difference was found between results from human graders and those of AiMASK using two proportion Z test (p=0.74). AiMASK detected a total of 1,124,524 people, the majority of whom were in the protected group (95.98%). The unprotected group consisted of 2.06% who practised incorrect mask-wearing, and the other 1.96% were those who did not wear masks. A moderate negative correlation was found between the number of COVID-19 patients and the proportion of unprotected people (r= -0.507, p <0.001). People were 1.15 times more likely to be in the unprotected group during the holidays and in the evening than on working days and in the morning (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17, p <0.001). Districts in the city center were 1.31 times more likely to have higher proportions of unprotected individuals than suburban districts (OR=1.31, 95% CI 1.28-1.34, p <0.001). Conclusions: AiMASK was as effective as human graders in detecting face mask wearing. The prevailing number of COVID-19 infections affected peoples mask-wearing behavior, and half of the unprotected group were those who wore masks incorrectly. Public policies should communicate the importance of wearing masks consistently throughout the day and during holidays as well as providing instructions for effective mask wearing to prevent virus transmission.","output":"Reflecting on Public Behavior With Artificial Intelligence-assisted Detection of Face Mask Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease with far-ranging public health implications.

Several patients who were initially diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 later deteriorated and were reclassified to severe disease type. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to create a predictive model for COVID-19 ventilatory support and mortality early on from baseline (at the time of diagnosis) and routinely collected data of each patient (CXR, CBC, demographics, and patient history). METHODS: Four common machine learning algorithms, three data balancing techniques, and feature selection are used to build and validate predictive models for COVID-19 mechanical requirement and mortality. Baseline CXR, CBC, demographic, and clinical data were retrospectively collected from April 2, 2020, till June 18, 2020, for 5739 patients with confirmed PCR COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh. However, of those patients, only 1508 and 1513 have met the inclusion criteria for ventilatory support and mortalilty endpoints, respectively. RESULTS: In an independent test set, ventilation requirement predictive model with top 20 features selected with reliefF algorithm from baseline radiological, laboratory, and clinical data using support vector machines and random undersampling technique attained an AUC of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. For mortality endpoint, the top model yielded an AUC of 0.83 and a balanced accuracy of 0.80 using all features with balanced random forest. This indicates that with only routinely collected data our models can predict the outcome with good performance. The predictive ability of combined data consistently outperformed each data set individually for intubation and mortality. For the ventilator support, chest X-ray severity annotations alone performed better than comorbidity, complete blood count, age, or gender with an AUC of 0.85 and balanced accuracy of 0.79. For mortality, comorbidity alone achieved an AUC of 0.80 and a balanced accuracy of 0.72, which is higher than models that use either chest radiograph, laboratory, or demographic features only.

Here we investigate how societies as a whole, and governments, in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalisation of the SIR model, the controlled SIR model. We posit that containment measures correspond to feedback between the status of the outbreak (the daily or the cumulative number of cases and fatalities) and the reproduction factor. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short- and long-term control parameters. Furthermore, we identified for numerous countries a relationship between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak in daily fatalities. As the number of fatalities corresponds to the number of hospitalised patients, the relationship can be used to predict the cumulative medical load, once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.","output":"Predicting the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks after the peak in daily fatalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Repurposing strategies to address the COVID-19 pandemic have been accelerated. As both pregnant and paediatric patients are likely to be excluded from most planned investigations, the list of repurposed options and the available data on these drugs and vaccines provide a baseline risk assessment and identify gaps for targeted investigation. METHODS: Clinical trials have been searched and reviewed; 23 repurposed drugs and drug combinations and nine candidate vaccines have been assessed regarding the availability of relevant data in paediatrics and pregnant women and to evaluate expected or unanticipated risk. RESULTS: Thirteen of the repurposed drugs or drug combinations are indicated for use in paediatrics in some age category albeit for indications other than COVID-19; 10 of these are indicated for use in pregnant women. Even in cases where these drugs are indicated in the populations, source data from which safety and or dosing could be extrapolated for use in COVID-19 is sparse. Vaccine trials are ongoing and generally exclude pregnant women; only in a few instances have paediatric subgroups been planned for enrolment. Data from individual case studies and RWD may suggest that subpopulations of both paediatric patients and pregnant women may be more at risk, particularly those in an increased inflammatory state. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with more prospective collaboration, plans are evolving to ensure that we will be better prepared to address similar situations especially in paediatrics and pregnant women where experience is limited and actual practice relies heavily on leveraging data from other populations and indications.","output":"Risk assessment of therapeutic agents under consideration to treat COVID-19 in paediatric patients and pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Early in vitro studies have suggested that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a potentially useful drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using the records of the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) claim records. The clinical data of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. We compared the attack rate of COVID-19 between those who underwent HCQ therapy within 14 days before the test for SARS-CoV-2 (HCQ users) and HCQ non-users.

Methods: This research was conducted at the ecological level using data from 100 countries which were chosen randomly. The adjusted values were predicted using beta regression considering predictive factors such as total expenditure on health per capita, expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP, life expectancy and the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, hospital beds (per 1000 population), physicians (per 1000 population), nurses (per 1000 population), prevalence of smoking, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and number of confirmed tests in each country. In the end, applying Monte Carlo simulation, the adjusted values of mortality rate and case fatality rate for the whole world were estimated. Results: The results of this study showed that two factors including percentage of population ages 65 and above (P=0.03) and Total expenditure on health as % of GDP (P = 0.04) had a statistically significant relationship with the case fatality rate. Moreover, there was a statistically significant relationship between the mortality rate and life expectancy (P = 0.02), total expenditure on health per capita (P < 0.001), nurses (Per 1000 Population) (P=0.04), and the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (P=0.04). The mortality rate and case fatality rate for the whole world were estimated to be 0.000001 and 0.026, respectively. Conclusion: It seems that what can cause global concern is not the case fatality rate of the disease, but its mortality rate, which is directly related to the health status of a community.

We studied whether use of NSAIDs was associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Danish administrative and health registries. We included individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period 27 February 2020 to 29 April 2020. NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-users on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs. The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy. A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI ?3.5% to 3.7%, p = 0.95), risk of hospitalization (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53, p = 0.31; RD 3.3%, 95% CI ?3.4% to 10%, p = 0.33), ICU admission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, p = 0.90; RD 0.2%, 95% CI ?3.0% to 3.4%, p = 0.90), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.30, p = 0.72; RD 0.5%, 95% CI ?2.5% to 3.6%, p = 0.73), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.09, p = 0.81; RD ?0.2%, 95% CI ?2.0% to 1.6%, p = 0.81). The main limitations of the study are possible exposure misclassification, as not all individuals who fill an NSAID prescription use the drug continuously, and possible residual confounding by indication, as NSAIDs may generally be prescribed to healthier individuals due to their side effects, but on the other hand may also be prescribed for early symptoms of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy in Danish individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. RESULTS: Of the 303 264 patients included, 290 131 were from the US, 7599 from South Korea, 5230 from Spain, and 304 from China. 3455 drugs were identified. Common repurposed drugs were hydroxychloroquine (used in from <5 (<2%) patients in China to 2165 (85.1%) in Spain), azithromycin (from 15 (4.9%) in China to 1473 (57.9%) in Spain), combined lopinavir and ritonavir (from 156 (<2%) in the VA-OMOP US to 2,652 (34.9%) in South Korea and 1285 (50.5%) in Spain), and umifenovir (0% in the US, South Korea, and Spain and 238 (78.3%) in China). Use of adjunctive drugs varied greatly, with the five most used treatments being enoxaparin, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids.

When these measures were in full effect, new cases of infection would be primarily induced by community spread, such as the human interaction within and between neighboring cities and towns, which is generally known as the meso-scale. Existing studies of COVID-19 using mathematical models are unable to accommodate the need for meso-scale modeling, because of the unavailability of COVID-19 data at this scale and the different timings of local intervention policies. In this respect, we propose a meso-scale mathematical model of COVID-19 using town-level infection data in the state of Connecticut. We consider the spatial interaction in terms of the inter-town travel in the model. Based on the developed model, we evaluated how different strengths of social distancing policy enforcement may impact future epidemic curves based on two evaluative metrics: compliance and containment.

METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study. In 2017 we invited the paediatric nurses (N = 165) working in Barcelona public primary health centres with paediatric departments (N = 41) to participate. They answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic and behavioural variables: severity and perceived probability of contracting the diseases of the vaccines in the vaccination schedule; safety and protection offered by each vaccine; and beliefs, social norms, and knowledge about vaccines. Outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, dichotomized into not hesitant (nurses who would vaccinate their own offspring), and hesitant (including those who would not vaccinate them, those who had doubts and those who would delay the administration of one or more vaccines). We performed bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: 83% of paediatric nurses (N = 137) agreed to participate. 67.9% had the intention to vaccinate their children of all the vaccines in the systematic schedule. 32.1% of nurses experienced vaccine hesitancy, especially about the HPV (21.9%) and varicella (17.5%) vaccines. The multivariate analysis suggests associations between hesitancy and low perception of the severity of whooping cough (aOR: 3.88; 95%CI:1.32C11.4), low perception of safety of the HPV vaccine (aOR:8.5;95%CI:1.24C57.8), the belief that vaccines are administered too early (aOR:6.09;95%CI:1.98C18.8), and not having children (aOR:4.05;95%CI:1.22C13.3). CONCLUSIONS: Although most paediatric nurses had the intention to vaccinate their own children, almost one-third reported some kind of vaccine hesitancy, mainly related to doubts about HPV and varicella vaccines, as well as some misconceptions.

We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22-28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29-31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.","output":"The Global Case-Fatality Rate of COVID-19 Has Been Declining Since May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology advancements promote a redefinition of traditional instructional methodologies, as well as the roles of teachers and learners towards an efficient e-learning ecosystem.

We show that viruses of all genera and from all hosts contain clusters of acylated cysteines in HA, S and E, consistent with the essential function of the modification. In contrast, some Flu viruses lost the acylated cysteine in M2 during evolution, suggesting that it does not affect viral fitness. Members of the DHHC family catalyze palmitoylation. Twenty-three DHHCs exist in humans, but the number varies between vertebrates. SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A proteins are acylated by an overlapping set of DHHCs in human cells. We show that these DHHC genes also exist in other virus hosts. Localization of amino acid substitutions in the 3D structure of DHHCs provided no evidence that their activity or substrate specificity is disturbed. We speculate that newly emerged CoVs or Flu viruses also depend on S-acylation for replication and will use the human DHHCs for that purpose. This feature makes these DHHCs attractive targets for pan-antiviral drugs.","output":"S-Acylation of Proteins of Coronavirus and Influenza Virus: Conservation of Acylation Sites in Animal Viruses and DHHC Acyltransferases in Their Animal Reservoirs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, and invariably fatal, condition that is believed to arise in genetically susceptible individuals as a consequence of an aberrant wound-healing response following repetitive alveolar injury.

Those that have, point to viruses playing a key role as cofactors in the initiation and progression of IPF. There is also some evidence to suggest that viral infection may be responsible for a proportion of acute exacerbations of IPF. The role played by bacteria in the pathogenesis of IPF is less clear cut. Studies from other respiratory diseases suggest that alterations in the lung microbiome are associated with disease and that these changes influence disease behaviour. Emerging molecular microbiological techniques are making the study of microbial communities in the lung easier. It is hoped that by combining such techniques with the careful longitudinal phenotyping of patients with IPF, it will be possible to elucidate the role played by bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Understanding the accuracy and limitations of statistical methods to estimate the basic reproduction number, R(0), in the context of emerging epidemics is therefore vital to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and the subsequent implications for control efforts. METHODS: Using simulated epidemic data we assess the performance of 7 commonly-used statistical methods to estimate R(0) as they would be applied in a real-time outbreak analysis scenario C fitting to an increasing number of data points over time and with varying levels of random noise in the data. Method comparison was also conducted on empirical outbreak data, using Zika surveillance data from the 2015-2016 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. RESULTS: We find that most methods considered here frequently over-estimate R(0) in the early stages of epidemic growth on simulated data, the magnitude of which decreases when fitted to an increasing number of time points. This trend of decreasing bias over time can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic or the need for control efforts. CONCLUSIONS: We show that true changes in pathogen transmissibility can be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision in the early stages of epidemic growth, particularly for data with significant over-dispersion. As localised epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 take hold around the globe, awareness of this trend will be important for appropriately cautious interpretation of results and subsequent guidance for control efforts.","output":"A comparative analysis of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number in emerging epidemics with implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zero-emission transport is a very important topic that is increasingly taken up by many institutions and research centers around the world.

METHODS We analyzed the dynamics of calls to the Regional Center for Poison Control and Prevention serving Massachusetts and Rhode Island (MARI PCC) and tweets discussing treating COVID-19 with house cleaners from January 20, 2020 to May 5, 2020. We obtained publicly available tweets discussing the use of household cleaners to \\"cure COVID\\" from the same time period with geographic co-ordinates indicating that they were emitted from the Greater Boston Area. RESULTS Our main finding is that public health efforts were followed by a sustained increase in calls after March 15, 2020 (10  2 calls per day before to 15  2.5 after) while misinformation on social media was associated with intermittent spikes in calls. Overall, calls significantly increased during the study period by 34% as compared to the previous 8 years, mostly reporting unintentional ingestions with no serious effects.

METHODS Prospective study, patients  18 years with cancer and HSCT admitted with fever at a National Bone Marrow Transplant Center (Hospital Calvo Mackenna), Chile, (April-2016 to May-2019). Clinical assessment, laboratory tests, blood cultures, nasopharyngeal sample for multiplex-PCR (Filmarray?), viral loads by PCR and cytokine panel (Luminex?, 38 cytokines) were performed. The following outcomes were evaluated: upper/lower respiratory tract disease (RTD), admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, mortality and antimicrobial withdrawal. RESULTS Of 56 febrile episodes, 35 (63%) were RVI, 12 (21%) BI and 9 (16%) with unknown etiology (UE). Median of age was 8.5 years, 62% male gender. Rhinovirus (54%) and coronavirus (15%) were the more frequent detected viruses. No significant differences in cytokine levels were observed between RVI and BI. 94% of RVI patients had symptomatic RTD, versus 33% in BI and 33% in UE group (p < 0.001), with lower-RTD in 69% of RVI group (p < 0,001). Admission to ICU was 11% in RVI, 17% in BI and 11% in UE group (p = 0.88); only 2 patients required mechanical ventilation (p = 0.37) and no mortality was reported. After an RVI was detected by PCR, antimicrobials were withdrawal in 26% of patients with RVI (p: 0.04). CONCLUSION RVI are frequent etiologic agents in febrile episodes of patients with HSCT.

To achieve this aim, buildings located in different neighborhood environment in Hong Kong are selected.

The E virus formed tiny plaques and reached optimal infectious titers many orders of magnitude below those of wild-type virus. We have now characterized highly aberrant viral transcription patterns that developed in some stocks of the E mutant. Extensive analysis of three independent stocks revealed that, in each, a faster-growing virus harboring a genomic duplication had been selected. Remarkably, the net result of each duplication was the creation of a variant version of the membrane protein (M) gene that was situated upstream of the native copy of the M gene. Each different variant M gene encoded an expressed protein (M*) containing a truncated endodomain. Reconstruction of one variant M gene in a E background showed that expression of the M* protein markedly enhanced the growth of the E mutant and that the M* protein was incorporated into assembled virions.

Those who were willing to take PrEP had a lower level of education, were involved in high-risk sexual behaviors, used alcohol or drugs before or during sex, and had previously used PrEP/PEP compared with participants who maybe would consider taking or would not take PrEP.

CONCLUSIONS: PrEP awareness was high, and 44.8% indicated willingness to take PrEP, especially those who reported high-risk sexual behaviors. This supports the current policy in Israel to allow PrEP to MSM who are at high-risk. In order to maintain a high level of PrEP-adherence, physicians should consider structural barriers, such as negative stigma of being promiscuous, lack of perceived HIV-risk, difficulties in accessing clinics or paying for PrEP, inability to follow-up or low tolerability of the medication.

Deciphering how macrophages regulate their transition from one state to the other is key for a deeper understanding of inflammatory diseases and relevant therapies. Common regulatory motifs reported for macrophage transitions, such as positive or double-negative feedback loops, exhibit a switchlike behavior, suggesting the bistability of the system. In this review, we explore the evidence for multistability (including bistability) in macrophage activation pathways at four molecular levels. First, a decision-making module in signal transduction includes mutual inhibitory interactions between M1 (STAT1, NF-KB/p50-p65) and M2 (STAT3, NF-KB/p50-p50) signaling pathways. Second, a switchlike behavior at the gene expression level includes complex network motifs of transcription factors and miRNAs. Third, these changes impact metabolic gene expression, leading to switches in energy production, NADPH and ROS production, TCA cycle functionality, biosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism. Fourth, metabolic changes are monitored by metabolic sensors coupled to AMPK and mTOR activity to provide stability by maintaining signals promoting M1 or M2 activation. In conclusion, we identify bistability hubs as promising therapeutic targets for reverting or blocking macrophage transitions through modulation of the metabolic environment.","output":"Multistability in Macrophage Activation Pathways and Metabolic Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small-sized droplets/aerosol transmission is one of the factors responsible for the spread of COVID-19, in addition to large droplets and surface contamination (fomites). While large droplets and surface contamination can be relatively easier to deal with (i.e., using mask and proper hygiene measures), aerosol presents a different challenge due to their ability to remain airborne for a long time. This calls for mitigation solutions that can rapidly eliminate the airborne aerosol. Pre-COVID-19, air ionizers have been touted as effective tools to eliminate small particulates. In this work, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a novel plant-based ionizer in eliminating aerosol. It was found that factors such as the ion concentration, humidity, and ventilation can drastically affect the efficacy of aerosol removal. The aerosol removal rate was quantified in terms of ACH (air changes per hour) and CADR- (clean air delivery rate-) equivalent unit, with ACH as high as 12 and CADR as high as 141 ft(3)/minute being achieved by a plant-based ionizer in a small isolated room. This work provides an important and timely guidance on the effective deployment of ionizers in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 spread via airborne aerosol, especially in a poorly-ventilated environment.","output":"The Efficacy of Plant-Based Ionizers in Removing Aerosol for COVID-19 Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global community has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic LGBTQ+ (i e , lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, etc ) youth may face increased stressors amidst the pandemic given their significant mental and sexual health disparities, pervasive rejection ? including quarantining in homes with heightened risk of abuse and victimization, and a lack of access to essential resources Responsive supports are needed at this time for vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth, particularly tailored mental health supports This critical reflexive paper will highlight, as qualitative social work researchers and practitioners, the swift response to the needs of vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth across Canada during this pandemic We provide a transparent account of how we have utilized critical reflexivity, cultivated through qualitative research, to support LGBTQ+ youth This article will elucidate the importance of critical reflexivity in effectively transitioning essential offline mental health services for LGBTQ+ youth to a technology-mediated mental health affirmative intervention The aim of this paper is to provide qualitative researchers and practitioners practical direction through important insights gleaned by supporting marginalized LGBTQ+ youth during particularly trying times such as a global pandemic","output":"Critical reflections and reflexivity on responding to the needs of LGBTQ+ youth in a global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autopsies represent medical procedures through which the causes of patients' deaths are determined or, through tissue sampling and microscopic examination of slides in usual stains or special tests, one can offer the basis for understanding the physiopathological mechanisms that contribute to the patients' death Histological findings of tissue samples from patients who have died of COVID-19 have been mainly orientated to lung, heart, liver, kidney damage with a small percent of them following other organs, but none has, to our knowledge, studied skeletal muscle.","output":"Histological findings in skeletal muscle of SARS-CoV2 infected patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To identify which international HTA agencies are undertaking evaluations of medical tests, summarise commonalities and differences in methodological approach, and highlight examples of best practice. Methods: A methodological review incorporating: systematic identification of HTA guidance documents mentioning evaluation of tests; identification of key contributing organisations and abstraction of approaches to all essential HTA steps; summary of similarities and differences between organisations; and identification of important emergent themes which define the current state of the art and frontiers where further development is needed. Results: Seven key organisations were identified from 216 screened. The main themes were: elucidation of claims of test benefits; attitude to direct and indirect evidence of clinical effectiveness (including evidence linkage); searching; quality assessment; and health economic evaluation. With the exception of dealing with test accuracy data, approaches were largely based on general approaches to HTA with few test-specific modifications. Elucidation of test claims and attitude to direct and indirect evidence are where we identified the biggest dissimilarities in approach. Conclusions: There is consensus on some aspects of HTA of tests, such as dealing with test accuracy, and examples of good practice which HTA organisations new to test evaluation can emulate. The focus on test accuracy contrasts with universal acknowledgement that it is not a sufficient evidence base for test evaluation. There are frontiers where methodological development is urgently required, notably integrating direct and indirect evidence and standardising approaches to evidence linkage.","output":"Health Technology Assessment of Diagnostic Tests: A state of the art review of methods guidance from international organisations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively map the existing evidence assessing the impact of travel-related control measures for containment of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Rapid evidence map. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science, and COVID-19 specific databases offered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies in human populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1/severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus/Middle East respiratory syndrome or influenza. Interventions of interest were travel-related control measures affecting travel across national or subnational borders. Outcomes of interest included infectious disease, screening, other health, economic and social outcomes. We considered all empirical studies that quantitatively evaluate impact available in Armenian, English, French, German, Italian and Russian based on the teams language capacities. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardised manner and mapped them to a priori and (one) post hoc defined categories. RESULTS: We included 122 studies assessing travel-related control measures. These studies were undertaken across the globe, most in the Western Pacific region (n=71). A large proportion of studies focused on COVID-19 (n=59), but a number of studies also examined SARS, MERS and influenza. We identified studies on border closures (n=3), entry/exit screening (n=31), travel-related quarantine (n=6), travel bans (n=8) and travel restrictions (n=25). Many addressed a bundle of travel-related control measures (n=49). Most studies assessed infectious disease (n=98) and/or screening-related (n=25) outcomes; we found only limited evidence on economic and social outcomes. Studies applied numerous methods, both inferential and descriptive in nature, ranging from simple observational methods to complex modelling techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base on travel-related control measures. While this map is not sufficient to assess the effectiveness of different measures, it outlines aspects regarding interventions and outcomes, as well as study methodology and reporting that could inform future research and evidence synthesis.","output":"Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: an evidence map"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Preoperative results of the 6-min walking test help to identify risk of postoperative complications and increased mortality in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer. The aim of the study was to validate the value of 500 m in 6MWT as an indicator, which differentiates risk of complications in patients undergoing pneumonectomy. 125 patients who underwent pneumonectomy at Thoracic Surgery Department between 2009 and 2018. Additionally, on the day before the surgery, patients performed the 6-min walking test. We analyzed 93 men and 32 women with a median age of 63 years. The cut-off value of 500 m identified patients with increased 90-day mortality, first-year mortality, and overall survival. Patients who covered a distance  500 m had an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac complications. Patients who do not reach the distance of 500 m in 6-min walking test have a high risk of early postoperative death after pneumonectomy. ABSTRACT: Due to its debilitating character pneumonectomy this is last-resort procedure. Preoperative results of the 6-min walking test (6MWT) help to identify high risk of postoperative complications and increased mortality in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer. The aim of the study was to validate the value of 500 m in 6MWT as an indicator, which differentiates risk of complications in patients undergoing pneumonectomy. 125 patients who underwent pneumonectomy at Thoracic Surgery Department between 2009 and 2018. On the day preceding the surgery, patients underwent 6MWT. The patients were in median age of 63 years. The cut-off value of 500 m identified patients with increased 90-day mortality [17.9% vs. 3.5%, odds ratio (OR) 6.271, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.528C25.739], first-year mortality (30.7% vs. 11.6%, OR 3.378, 95% CI 1.310C8.709), and overall survival (p = 0.02). Patients who covered a distance  500 m had an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (35.9% vs. 16.3%, OR 2.880, 95% CI 1.207C6.870) and cardiac complications (38.4% vs. 19.8%, OR 2.537, 95% CI 1.100C5.849). Patients unable to reach 500 m in 6MWT are in a high risk of postoperative death after pneumonectomy, what may be a result of increased frequency of postoperative cardiac complications. Poor result of 6MWT is a predictor of worse overall survival.","output":"Physiological Biomarkers Assessed by Low-Tech Exercise Tests Predict Complications and Overall Survival in Patients Undergoing Pneumonectomy Due to Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the report of the first case of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019, several associated thrombotic complications have been reported, mainly venous thromboembolic events, and myocardial infarctions, in addition to peripheral arterial thrombosis and cerebral vascular events, which have been attributed to a hypercoagulable state.

METHODS: This pilot study offered group cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis via videoconferencing to 14 individuals with early psychosis either living in remote areas or confined during the pandemic. RESULTS: The rate of consenting to the study (79%) and actual participation rates were acceptable (18.5 sessions out of 24). Although some technological obstacles were encountered, solutions offered allowed the videoconferencing group to be considered feasible for most participants and therapists. Prepost results on symptoms and self-esteem were comparable to those of other studies using the same group treatment but in-person. Alliance scores seemed similar as well.

We make choices concerning the systems and questions we study. Our research then amplifies these choices into factors that influence the directions of future research by shaping our hypotheses, data analyses, interpretation, publication venues, and dissemination via other methods.

This extends to the systems and data that we consider to be ethically obtainable or available for study, and who is considered qualified to do research, ask questions, and communicate about research. It is also influenced by the profitability of concepts like open-access-a system designed to improve equity, but which enacts gatekeeping in unintended but foreseeable ways.

Immediate molecular testing and/or thyroid surgery was offered, except when the patient (i) could not afford molecular testing/rejected the surgery, (ii) had a high surgical risk, (iii) had other disorders/comorbidities which needed to be addressed with higher priority, and (iv) had undetectable serum calcitonin levels, in whom active surveillance (AS) was performed. RESULTS: From 155 patients, only two patients could afford molecular testing; 84% (n = 130) underwent immediate thyroid surgery: lobectomy was performed in only 8% (n = 10). AS was the initial management for 15% (n = 23) of the patients.

Two consecutive VOT's were performed on healthy volunteers and tissue oxygenation was measured with MSI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Correlations between the rate of desaturation, recovery and the hyperemic area under the curve (AUC) measured by MSI and NIRS were calculated. Fifty-eight volunteers were included. The MSI oxygenation curves showed identifiable components of the VOT, including a desaturation and recovery slope and hyperemic area under the curve, similar to those measured with NIRS. The correlation between the rate of desaturation measured by MSI and NIRS was moderate: r = 0.42 (p = 0.001) for the first and r = 0.41 (p = 0.002) for the second test. Our results suggest that non-contact multispectral imaging is able to measure changes in regional oxygenation and deoxygenation during a vascular occlusion test in healthy volunteers.

This paper argues that efforts to develop responsible digital health practices could benefit from paying closer attention to a different branch of medical ethics, namely public health ethics. In particular, I argue that the influential accountability for reasonableness (A4R) approach to public health ethics can help overcome some of the limitations of existing digital ethics principles. A4R seeks to resolve trade-offs through decision-procedures designed according to certain shared procedural values. This allows stakeholders to recognize decisions reached through these procedures as legitimate, despite their underlying disagreements. I discuss the prospects for adapting A4R to the context of responsible digital health and suggest questions for further research.","output":"From General Principles to Procedural Values: Responsible Digital Health Meets Public Health Ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic since 2019. After infecting the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 shows ability to hijack the host immune system and launch a cytokines-storm. Smoking is reported to predispose patients to the respiratory system damage and lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and more severe outcomes. Stem cells (SCs) are proposed as an alternative therapy of COVID-19, especially the severe cases. OBJECTIVE to investigate the impact of smoking and vaping on the inflammatory response of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). HYPOTHESIS cigarette smoking and vaping inhibit the immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and regenerative properties of the DPSCs and will reduce the success of stem cell therapy of COVID-19. METHODS DPSCs were treated with various doses of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) or nicotine for 24-96 hours. Cell lysate and concentrated cell culture medium were collected at the end of the treatment. Expression of inflammatory cytokines were determined using human cytokine array, ELISA and quantitative PCR. RESULTS the level of TGF-b2 TGF-b3, pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC or CCL-18), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and LIGHT (TNF superfamily member 14) significantly decreased after 48 hours exposed to 100mg/ml CSC. Interestingly, nicotine induced a different pattern of change of cytokine release. ELISA and quantitative PCR also showed that CSC treatment led to elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 level and reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-b1 level in DPSC. CONCLUSION our current results indicated that smoking changes the cytokine expression profile in DPSCS, which has been used in clinical trials in treating COVID-19. In addition to sharing many similarities with bone marrow mesenchymal SCs, DPSCs are also easy to access and show low immunogenicity reaction, making them valuable source to battle COVID-19. We will further investigate the mechanism of how the SCs attenuate the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.","output":"Impact of Smoking On Immunomodulation Of Dental Pulp Stem Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns and quarantines were set up in various countries around the world to combat the Corona virus pandemic The pandemic has its mental health consequences which have been aggravated by the lockdown measures The resulting psychological distress and depression has ultimately led to suicides This study explores the trends of suicide in the month of the lockdown and compared it with those to the prior months The study was conducted between 25th January 2020 to 24th April 2020 and March 25th 2019 to April 24th 2019 at Cooch Behar Government Medical College and Hospital, Cooch Behar 52 1% cases of suicide were recorded in the month of lockdown which increased from 34 1% in February 2020 and 43 1% in March 2020 Most cases of suicide in the period of lockdown were in the second and third decade of life with a male predominance For the period of lockdown, housewives, businessmen and labourers were found out to be the vulnerable population A social and public health response in addition to a mental health response is crucial to prevent suicidal behaviour in lockdown period ? 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"Pattern of suicidal deaths in the first month of lockdown at a tertiary care hospital: A time trend analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to profound mental health consequences observed during acute infection and at short, medium, and long-term follow-up [1C3]. When considering long-term sequelae, a prevalent proportion of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 experience a Post-COVID-19 Syndrome characterized by fatigue, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and myalgia. In this context, fatigue is recognized as one of the leading complaints in COVID-19 survivors [4]. Long-term health consequences following COVID-19 and their impact on daily quality of life are largely unknown and need further investigation. Thus, questions about possible effects of mental health on fatigue, and of COVID-19 clinical severity on both, remained unanswered. We aim to predict long-term fatigue symptoms basing on clinical and psychopathological predictors through a machine learning approach. Methods: We evaluated the fatigue syndrome and the psychopathological status of 122 adult COVID-19 survivors (80 male, mean age 59.812.9) six months after hospital discharge for COVID-19. Clinical and psychopathological predictors were collected for the entire sample. Fatigue at six months was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Descriptive statistical analyses to compare means and frequencies were performed. To better disentangle the relationship between somatic and psychopathological predictors and the development of fatigue, we explored the effect of each predictor in affecting fatigue by implementing 5000 non-parametric bootstraps enhanced elastic net penalized logistic regression. The model's accuracy was estimated by 5-folds stratified nested cross-validations in the outer loop to define balance accuracy value (BA), class accuracies, and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) (for a complete description of the method see [5]). Results: Six months after hospital discharge, 28%, 29%, and 24% of the total sample showed respectively depression (according to Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), anxiety (according to State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y), and sleep disturbances (according to Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale). Fatigue was present in 19% of the patients. When entering demographical, clinical, and psychopathological predictors in the elastic net penalized logistic regression, only depressive symptomatology significantly predicted the presence of fatigue at six months (Log Odds Ratio: 2.33;Standard deviation: 1.58;Lower and Upper 95% CI: -0.78 - 5.43;Variable Inclusion Probability: 96.7%). The 10-folds cross-validated elastic net model predicted fatigue with a BA of 65%, an AUC of 77%, and a specificity for the absence of fatigue of 74%, and a sensitivity for the presence of fatigue of 55%, showing good performances in excluding fatigue syndrome. Discussion: Besides confirming a high rate of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae, our main finding is the strict association between fatigue and depression. We fear that, rather independent of pneumonia severity, major depression after COVID-19 is associated with persistent fatigue, thus worsening the burden of a non-communicable condition triggered by infection and by infection-related systemic inflammation, but then persisting on its own. Post-COVID syndrome, mainly characterized by fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances, will affect COVID-19 survivors' daily functioning and place additional burden on the healthcare system. Clarifying the mechanisms and risk factors underlying such long-term symptomatology is essential to identify target population and to tailor specific treatment and rehabilitation interventions to foster recovery.

AIMS: Our study looks to observe if there has been an effect on the quality of colonoscopies, as indicated by quality measures such as the cecal intubation rate (CIR), cecal intubation time (CIT), scope withdrawal time (SWT), and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with the adoption of standard COVID-19 precautions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening colonoscopies. The study utilized data on CIR, CIT, SWT, and ADR from outpatient, nonemergent procedures conducted at 3 endoscopy suites of St. Luke's University Health Network. All inpatient and emergent procedures were excluded. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that the total number of screening colonoscopies was decreased between 2019 and 2020 (318 in 2019 vs. 157 in 2020, p = 0.005). CIT (320  105 seconds in 2019 vs. 392  107 seconds in 2020, p = 0.001) and SWT (706  232 seconds in 2019 vs. 830  241 seconds in 2020, p = 0.001) were increased while CIR (98.2% in 2019 vs. 96.6% in 2020, p = 0.04) was decreased between 2019 and 2020 likely due to PPE introduction.

CONCLUSION: Our study showed that quality indices for screening colonoscopies like CIR, CIT, and SWT were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 time period. ADR, however, was similar. Thus, the efficiency of the procedures was affected by the use of PPE but it did not affect the colonoscopy's clinical benefit.","output":"Effect of Using Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality Indicators of Screening Colonoscopies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achieving health equity is an ongoing priority for the global community.

The University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) in Rwanda has established the Institute of Global Health Equity Research (IGHER) to contribute to the generation of new knowledge through high-quality research and research training that seeks to improve our understanding of the important issues that influence the distribution of health and healthcare globally. With an unrelenting emphasis on increased impact by prioritizing implementation research, IGHER is particularly interested in amassing a compendium of important research lessons to increase the likelihood that effective implementation strategies will be employed to enhance healthcare service provision. IGHER organizes research according to five foundational research questions, which address different elements that are pivotal to a comprehensive approach to appreciating the nuanced realities of effective healthcare service provision. UGHE outputs for 2020 indicate that: appropriate resourcing of healthcare services is critical for the eradication of global health inequities; policy reform is required for many healthcare innovations and initiatives to be implemented adequately; and high-quality research that is applicable to different contexts is essential for eradicating global health inequities. Furthermore, reimagining healthcare delivery will benefit from an intentional, ongoing, bidirectional influence between evidence-based pedagogy (methods and practices of teaching, education, and instruction) and supporting research activity such that education and instruction inform the research conducted and research findings are fed back to the classroom to help improve education and instruction.

Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals precious time.

Some of these compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Presently, the pivotal role of H2 S in modulating the inflammatory response and pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade is well recognized, and the usefulness of some H2 S-donors for the treatment of acute lung inflammation has been reported.

Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49 million workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model suggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half, they need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in communication. Retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools are the most affected sectors. Our results can help target fiscal assistance to businesses that are most disrupted by social distancing.","output":"Business disruptions from social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nimodipine is routinely administered in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, the effect of nimodipine on oxygen exchange in the lungs is insufficiently explored. METHODS: The study explored nimodipine medication in artificially ventilated patients with aSAH. The data collection period was divided into nimodipine-dependent (ND) and nimodipine-independent (NID) periods. Values for arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) were collected and compared between the periods. Patients were divided in those with lung injury (LI), defined as median Horowitz index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) 40 kPa (300 mmHg), and without and in those with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and without. RESULTS: A total of 53 out of 150 patients were artificially ventilated, and in 29 patients, the Horowitz index could be compared between ND and NID periods. A linear mixed model showed that during ND period the Horowitz index was 2.3 kPa (95% CI, 1.0C3.5 kPa, P<0.001) lower when compared to NID period. The model suggested that in the presence of LI, ND period is associated with a decrease of the index by 2.8 kPa (95% CI, 1.2C4.3 kPa, P<0.001). The decrease was more pronounced with LRTI than without: 3.4 kPa (95% CI, 0.8C6.1 kPa) vs. 2.1 kPa (95% CI, 0.7C3.4 kPa), P=0.011 and P=0.002, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LI or LRTI in the context of aSAH, pulmonary function may worsen with nimodipine treatment. The drop of 2 to 3 kPa of the Horowitz index in patients with no lung pathology may not outweigh the benefits of nimodipine. However, in individuals with concomitant lung injury, the effect may be clinically relevant.","output":"The effect of nimodipine on pulmonary function in artificially ventilated patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of rural communities always have struggled to gain access to effective mental health services, and the COVID-19 crisis has only added to the urgency of the problem A bipartisan group of U S senators is responding with proposed legislation that would establish a telemental health care demonstration program targeting three key industry groups prominent in rural areas","output":"Senate bill would authorize grants to expand rural telemental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and chloroquine treatment for COVID-19 has not been verified.

Studies reported highly variable uptake (from 0% to 78%). A main facilitator for uptake among pregnant women was receiving a recommendation from their HCP. However, studies showed that HCP awareness of guidelines did not consistently translate into them recommending vaccines to pregnant women. Safety concerns are a well-established barrier to uptake/coverage of maternal immunization; 7%-52% of unvaccinated women gave safety concerns as a reason but these were also present in vaccinated women. Knowledge/awareness gaps among pregnant women and lack of confidence among HCPs to discuss vaccination were both important barriers. Several studies indicated that midwives were more likely to express safety concerns than other HCPs, and less likely to recommend vaccination to pregnant women. Women who perceived the risk of infection to be low were less likely to accept vaccination in several studies, along with women with prior vaccine refusal. Findings highlight the importance of further research to explore context-specific barriers to vaccination in pregnancy, which may include lack of vaccine confidence among pregnant woman and HCPs, and policy and structural factors.","output":"Barriers and Facilitators Associated With Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake Among Pregnant Women in High Income Countries: A Mini-Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A safe and effective vaccine is critical to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Demographic and injury specific datapoints were compared across calendar years. RESULTS: There were 111, 100, and 52 trauma activations during the study interval in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. There were fewer highest severity level activations in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019 (1 vs 5 and 9; p < 0.01). The median Injury Severity Score was 5 in 2020 compared to 4 in both 2018 and 2019 (p < 0.01).

Apoptosis in piriform cortex was greater in hypoxic-asphyxic, rewarmed piglets than in naive/sham piglets. Caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis with rewarming. Rapidly rewarmed piglets had more caspase-3 cleavage in cerebral cortex than did piglets that remained hypothermic or piglets that were rewarmed slowly.

RESULTS: Four thematic areas were identified: human resources, logistics, HCW attitudes and community attitudes. The survey response rate was 70.3% (407/579). Commonly reported barriers to COVID-19 swabbing were insufficient staff trained (74.0%, n = 301), inadequate staffing in general (64.9%, n = 264), insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (60.9%, n = 248) and no cold chain to store swabs (57.5%, n = 234). Commonly reported enablers to swabbing were community awareness and risk communication (80.8%, n = 329), consistent and sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (67.8%, n = 276), increased surge workforce (63.9%, n = 260) and having a fridge to store swabs (59.7%, n = 243). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive community and HCW engagement strategy combined with innovations to improve the supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets. Investments in increasing numbers of frontline workforce, consistent supplies of PPE, swabs, transport medium, cold boxes and ability to make ice packs, in addtion to establishing regular tranport of specimens from the facility to the testing site will strengthen the supply chain. Innovations are needed to address these issues.","output":"Barriers and enablers experienced by health care workers in swabbing for COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea: A multi-methods cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We experiment with the log-returns of financial time series, providing multi-horizon forecasts with a selection of robust supervised learners. We devise an external input selection algorithm that aims to maximise regression R^2 whilst minimising feature correlations and can operate efficiently in a high-dimensional setting. We improve upon the earlier work on radial basis function networks (rbfnets), which applies feature representation transfer from clustering algorithms to supervised learners. Rather than using a randomised, scalar standard deviation for each hidden processing unit (hpu)'s radial basis function, we use a covariance matrix estimated via a Bayesian map approach. If many (few) training data points are assigned to the j'th cluster, the j'th covariance matrix will resemble the maximum likelihood (diagonalised variance prior) estimate. More precisely, we operate with and adapt the precision (inverse covariance) matrices; this leads to a test time fitting time-complexity of O(kd^2), where k is the number of hpus and d is the external input dimensionality. Our approach leads to a reduction from O(kd^3) when inverting covariance matrices. Furthermore, we sequentially optimise the hpu parameters with an exponential decay to facilitate regime changes or concept drifts. Our experiments demonstrate that our online rbfnet outperforms a random-walk baseline and several powerful batch learners. The outperformance is not purely down to sequential updating in the test set. Instead, a competitor ewrls model is updated similarly and performs less well than several batch-learners. Finally, our online rbfnet has hpus that retain greater similarity between training and test vectors, ensuring that it obtains the smallest prediction mean squared errors.","output":"Online Learning with Radial Basis Function Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 The establishment of standardized RT-qPCR protocols for respiratory secretions testing, as well as sharing of specimens, data, and information became critical Here, we investigate the analytical performance of two interim RT-qPCR protocols (Charit&eacute;and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform Analytical specificity, PCR amplification efficiency, analytical sensitivity (limit of detection), and cross-reactivity were evaluated using contrived samples The on-going accuracy was evaluated by retrospective analysis of our test results database (real clinical samples) N1, E, and a modified version of RdRP assays presented adequate analytical specificity, amplification efficiency, and analytical sensitivity using contrived samples The three assays were applied to all individuals who requested the SARS-CoV-2 molecular test assay in our laboratory and it was observed that N1 gave more positive results than E, and E gave more positive results than RdRP (modified) The RdRP and E were removed from the test and its final version, based on N1 assay only, was applied to 30,699 Brazilian individuals (from 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020) The aggregated test results available in the database were also presented","output":"Analytical Sensitivity and Specificity of Two RT-qPCR Protocols for SARS-CoV-2 Detection Performed in an Automated Workflow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We show that sub-spreading events i.e., transmission events in which an infection propagates to few or no individuals, can be surprisingly important for defining the lifetime of an infectious disease epidemic and hence its waiting time to elimination or fade-out, measured from the time-point of its last observed case. While limiting super-spreading promotes more effective control when cases are growing, we find that when incidence is waning, curbing sub-spreading is more important for achieving reliable elimination of the epidemic. Controlling super-spreading in this low-transmissibility phase offers diminishing returns over non-selective population-wide measures. By restricting sub-spreading we efficiently dampen remaining variations among event reproduction numbers, which minimises the risk of premature and late end-of-epidemic declarations. Because case-ascertainment rates can be modelled in exactly the same way as control policies, we concurrently show that the under-reporting of sub-spreading events during waning phases will engender overconfident assessments of epidemic elimination. While controlling sub-spreading may not be easily realised, the likely neglecting of these events by surveillance systems could result in unexpectedly risky end-of-epidemic declarations. Super-spreading controls the size of the epidemic peak but sub-spreading mediates the variability of its tail.","output":"Sub-spreading events limit the reliable elimination of heterogeneous epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using work from home (WFH) scores obtained by matching Philippine occupations with classifications defined by Dingle and Neiman (2020), this paper estimates that only 12.38 percent of all workers can work from home and 25.7 percent of Philippine occupations are teleworkable, mostly from the following occupation groups: professionals, clerical support workers, and technicians and associate professionals.

Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. In March 2020, at the start of the Coronavirus -19 pandemic, clinicians raised concerns regarding continuation of antipsychotic treatment, and specifically of clozapine, in patients with coronavirus disease. We aimed here at providing a short report focusing on the association between neutropenia and clozapine in a case series of psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. PATIENTS & METHODS: We retrospectively inspected data of 10 patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and July 2020; selection was based on their COVID-19 positive PCR test. We used a linear regression model to estimate whether there was a significant drop in the neutrophil count during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis was done in R using a linear regression to the origin. RESULTS: Data were collected on 10 patients, of which 7 were males. During COVID-19 infection, neutrophils count (ANC) 4.13  109/l (SD = 2.70) from a baseline value of 5.2  109/l (SD = 2.24). The mean relative reduction in ANC was -0.2729 (SD = 0.1666). The beta value of 0.8377 obtained with the linear regression showed that ANC values during SARS-CoV-2 infection were 83.77% of the baseline ANC showing that within the two time points there was a decrease in ANC of 16.23%. The linear regression had a pvalue = 8.96 x 10-8 and an adjusted R2 of 95.94% which shows that the variability of the data is very well explained by the model. We also compared baseline ANC with ANC values approximately a month after resolution of the infection and results indicate that ANC values return to a 95% of baseline.

Accordingly, continuous efforts are required to find solutions to address the issue of excessive CO(2) emission and its potential effects on climate change. It is imperative that the world looks towards a portfolio of carbon mitigation solutions, rather than a single strategy. In this regard, the use of CO(2) as a C1 source is an attractive strategy as CO(2) has the potential to be a great asset for the industrial sector and consumers across the globe. In particular, the reduction of CO(2) offers an alternative to fossil fuels for various organic industrial feedstocks and fuels. Consequently, efficient and scalable approaches for the reduction of CO(2) to products such as methane and methanol can generate value from its emissions. Accordingly, in recent years, metal-free catalysis has emerged as a sustainable approach because of the mild reaction conditions by which CO(2) can be reduced to various value-added products. The metal-free catalytic reduction of CO(2) offers the development of chemical processes with low cost, earth-abundant, non-toxic reagents, and low carbon-footprint. Thus, this perspective aims to present the developments in both the reduction and reductive functionalization chemistry of CO(2) during the last decade using various metal-free catalysts.","output":"From CO(2) activation to catalytic reduction: a metal-free approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a major role in addressing novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)-related issues and is also used in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP).

Living in close quarters with others and in need of around-the-clock assistance, interactions with older adults, which were previously in person, have been replaced by virtual chatting using information and communication technologies (ICTs). ICT applications such as FaceTime, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams video chatting have been overwhelmingly used by families to maintain residents social capital and subsequently reduce their SIL. OBJECTIVE: Because of the lack of substantive knowledge on this ever-increasing form of social communication, this systematic review intends to synthesize the effects of ICT interventions to address SIL among residents in LTCFs during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: We will include studies published in Chinese, English, and French from December 2019 onwards. Beyond the traditional search strategy approach, 4 of the 12 electronic databases to be queried will be in Chinese. We will include quantitative and intervention studies as well as qualitative and mixed methods designs. Using a 2-person approach, the principal investigator and one author will blindly screen eligible articles, extract data, and assess risk of bias. In order to improve the first round of screening, a pilot-tested algorithm will be used. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion with a third author. Results will be presented as structured summaries of the included studies. We plan to conduct a meta-analysis if sufficient data are available. RESULTS: A total of 1803 articles have been retrieved to date. Queries of the Chinese databases are ongoing. The systematic review and subsequent manuscript will be completed by the fall of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: ICT applications have become a promising avenue to reduce SIL by providing a way to maintain communication between LTCF residents and their families and will certainly remain in the postCCOVID-19 period. This review will investigate and describe context-pertinent and high-quality programs and initiatives to inform, at the macro level, policy makers and researchers, frontline managers, and families.

This article reviews reports of perinatal and breast milk transmission of ZIKV and summarizes current clinical outcome data of pediatric non-congenital ZIKV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Perinatal transmission and presence of infective ZIKV particles in breast milk have been reported. Most symptomatic non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children is mild and self-limited, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The mechanism and impact of perinatal and breast milk transmission is unclear. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed.

Much of the knowledge about type 1 diabetes (T1D) has focused on mechanisms of disease progression such as adaptive immune cells and the cytokines that control their function, whereas mechanisms linked with the initiation of the disease remain unknown. It has been hypothesized that in addition to genetics, environmental factors play a pivotal role in triggering -cell autoimmunity. The BioBreeding Diabetes Resistant (BBDR) and LEW1.WR1 rats have been used to decipher the mechanisms that lead to virus-induced T1D. Both animals develop -cell inflammation and hyperglycemia upon infection with the parvovirus Kilham Rat Virus (KRV). Our earlier in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that KRV-induced innate immune upregulation early in the disease course plays a causal role in triggering -cell inflammation and destruction. Furthermore, we recently found for the first time that infection with KRV induces inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) detectable as early as day 1 post-infection prior to insulitis and hyperglycemia. The proinflammatory response in VAT is associated with macrophage recruitment, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress responses, apoptosis, and downregulation of adipokines and molecules that mediate insulin signaling. Downregulation of inflammation suppresses VAT inflammation and T1D development. These observations are strikingly reminiscent of data from obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in which VAT inflammation is believed to play a causal role in disease mechanisms. We propose that VAT inflammation and dysfunction may be linked with the mechanism of T1D progression.","output":"Visceral Adipose Tissue: A New Target Organ in Virus-Induced Type 1 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As thousands of retail establishments close in cities on both sides of the Atlantic, we face a future where non-retail uses will become an increasingly signifi cant and permanent part of our urban main streets.1 After decades of simmering urban retail decline, the demise of physical retailers in cities has accelerated in recent decades due to the rise of e-commerce and in recent years due to the eff ects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, in many countries, the work processes are still not well defined. In this sense, the perception of pharmacists about dispensing practices presents an overview of how the service is being performed in the country and its main challenges. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported work process of Brazilian community pharmacists in relation to drug dispensing, challenges, and strategies for carrying out the service. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May and July 2021, with community pharmacists from all regions of Brazil. Pharmacists were invited to answer a validated, self-administered questionnaire, implemented through Google Forms, containing 33 questions related to the steps of drug dispensing (questions and counseling) and the main challenges and strategies to perform the service. The data were exported to Microsoft Office Excel and SPSS?. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between responses and demographic information, with a significance level of less than 5% (p < 0.05). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (number: 4.295.171). RESULTS: A total of 625 community pharmacists responded to the survey. Most pharmacists reported always or frequently performing 17 (54%) of the 31 steps described in the instrument. The steps that pharmacists reported performing more frequently were forming the medication name (n = 569, 91.04%), verifying the completeness and adequacy of the prescription according to current legislation (n = 567, 90.72%) and providing counseling on dosage (n = 549, 87.84%). Documentation was the main step in which pharmacists reported never or rarely performing (n = 424, 67.84%). The results showed that there was a significant influence of the variables of public education institution, age, and postgraduate education on the frequency of dispensing steps (F(3, 621) = 14.884, p < 0.001; R(2)(ajdusted) = 0,063).

When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor.The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.","output":"COVID-19 and prejudice against migrants: the mediating roles of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations.

Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) mediates T helper 1 driven immune responses, and since mature IL-18 is up-regulated in human macrophages after influenza virus infection in vitro, it has been suggested that IL-18 plays an important role in the immune response to influenza. To determine the role of IL-18 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(-/-)) and normal wildtype mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus. Influenza resulted in an increase in constitutively expressed IL-18 in the lungs of wildtype mice. The clearance of influenza A was inhibited by IL-18, as indicated by reduced viral loads on day 8 and day 12 after infection in IL-18(-/-) mice. This enhanced viral clearance correlated with increased CD4(+) T-cell activation in the lungs as reflected by CD69 expression on the cell surface. Surprisingly, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels were similar in the lungs of IL-18(-/-) mice and wildtype mice. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining revealed similar expression levels in lung-derived natural killer cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, indicating that IFN-gamma production is IL-18-independent during influenza virus infection. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in IL-18(-/-) mice than in wildtype mice. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-18 impairs viral clearance during influenza A infection.","output":"Enhanced viral clearance in interleukin-18 gene-deficient mice after pulmonary infection with influenza A virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the highly contagious, causative agent of an economically important acute enteric disease in pigs of all ages.

Phylogenetic analysis showed a very high nucleotide similarity with a variant of PEDV that was isolated in the US in January 2014. The epidemiological situation of PEDV infections in the Netherlands in 2014 was unknown and a seroprevalence study in swine was performed. In total, 838 blood samples from sows from 267 farms and 101 samples from wild boars were collected from May till November 2014 and tested for antibodies against PEDV by ELISA. The apparent herd prevalence of 0.75% suggests that PEDV was not circulating on a large scale in the Netherlands at this time. However, in November 2014 a clinical outbreak of PEDV was diagnosed in a fattener farm by PCR testing. This was the first confirmed PEDV outbreak since the early nineties. Sequence analyses showed that the viruses isolated in 2014 and 2015 in the Netherlands cluster with recently found European G1b strains. This suggests a one event introduction of PEDV G1b strains in Europe in 2014, which made the Netherlands and other European countries endemic for this type of strains since then.","output":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) introduction into a naive Dutch pig population in 2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Preliminary retrospective reports showed that zinc supplementation may decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients, postulating the potential therapeutic efficacy of zinc in the management of the disease. OBJECTIVES We sought to summarize the studies published to date regarding the antiviral activity of zinc in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A meta-analysis was performed to compare the outcomes of hospitalized patients receiving zinc supplementation and those treated with standard care. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS Data relating to 1474 patients included in four studies were analyzed. Survival to hospital discharge was 56.8% in the zinc group, compared to 75.9% in the non-zinc group (P=0.88). In-hospital mortality was 22.3% in the zinc group, compared to 13.6% for the standard care group (P=0.16). Length of hospital stay was 7.7(3.7) days in the zinc group and 7.2(3.9) days in the standard treatment group (P<0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.9(1.7) days in the zinc group and 5.8(1.9) days in the standard care group (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Zinc supplementation did not have any beneficial impact on the course of COVID-19 evaluated as survival to hospital discharge and in-hospital mortality. The zinc-supplemented group had longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay.

One of these measures is social distancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closing public and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdown presupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more extreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided by Google for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies the variations in the circulation of people in South America for different types of social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020 and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, a general circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobility patterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and local Moran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countries with a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of the population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and Colombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially confirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained in the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, the observed data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures are necessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction in the circulation of people during the pandemic.","output":"Medidas de distanciamento social e mobilidade na Amrica do Sul durante a pandemia por COVID-19: Condi??es necessrias e suficientes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Panic buying behaviour is inherently undesirable due to its detrimental impact on community's resources and disruptions to supply chain systems. The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has seen a resurgence of this phenomenon across the world, leaving supermarkets in stockout situations. While panic buying is largely reasoned as a psychological reaction to an extreme event, it is also a socially relevant behaviour as our perception of a crisis can be shaped by our observations and interactions within the society. The social determinants of panic buying behaviour, particularly on how these factors heighten one's perception of scarcity, and trigger panic buying behaviour, are studied. A theoretical model is developed to explain panic buying behaviour in a social context by synthesizing various social and behavioural theories, and the inter-relationship among the latent constructs is analysed using the structural equation modelling approach. Accordingly, an online survey was administered and analysis of the data confirmed that non-coercive social influence, social norm and observational learning directly influence one's perception of scarcity. Additionally, perceived scarcity can motivate panic buying behaviour directly or indirectly through feelings of anticipated regret. This study has contributed to the limited literature on panic buying.

Personal stories associate an identified lifea specific, inherently sympathetic person who needs help nowwith a problem that can be solved by public action. This association enables us to draw parallels between ourselves and the identified lifethe storys protagonist. These parallels also motivate us to act on behalf of the identified life. The more emotionally charged the story, the more likely we are to credit the narrative as an accurate and representative portrayal of the problem. But public health focuses on the health of whole populations. Public health policies protect and promote the health of statistical lives, which are both numerous and invisible, and thus lack the immediate appeal of identified lives. For these reasons, personal narratives, while a powerful motivating force, can limit appreciation of the complexity of the public health issue and proposed policy to which they draw attention and sympathy. The Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 and its forty-one state law counterparts offer a stark example of how tragic personal storiesrather than sound data and normative justificationcreated laws that are at best misleading and inefficient, and at worst, dangerous to public health. This essay examines the history of investigational drugs and expanded access through some of the stories that influenced FDA policy and practice. It then turns its focus to the right to try movement and explores some of the many personal stories that were used to propel the development of right to try laws by focusing exclusively on autonomy and access. Our focus then shifts to those whose personal storiesequally compellingare not being told in the right to try discussions. These untold stories include narratives that highlight the need for careful science and the duties of researchers;stories that illustrate systematic disadvantage and structural injustice and can help demonstrate the need for a health care system that is meaningfully available to all from the outset;stories about unidentified statistical lives;stories from those who have come to regret the exercise of their right to try;and stories by and about those who have struggled between the do-everything mindset and the desire for a good death. We discuss the concept of identified lives and why the public supports rescuing individuals it deems attractive and deserving, and we address the problems associated with elevating these identified lives over other untold stories and statistical unidentified lives in the context of right to try laws. This essay concludes that personal narrative has a place in public health policy generally, and in the question of access to investigational drugs specifically. Personal stories, used judiciously, can be a powerful tool for advocating for needed change. However, in the context of access to investigational drugs, crafting policy with a sole focus on the primacy of personal choice and autonomy fails to incorporate the public policy mandate to base available choices on at least a minimal amount of safety data and a high degree of information transparency. Where research directed to improving human health is at issue, contributing to generalizable knowledgethe principal purpose of researchshould not be minimized because patients with life-threatening illnesses believe that they have nothing to lose by trying. While personal narratives can and should be considered, they should be combined with acknowledgment of the complexities of the investigational drug and clinical trial processes, and with awareness of the perennial and inevitable tension between providing access and collecting data supporting safety and efficacy. Even in the most tragic of circumstances, health care policy in this area deserves to be made collectively, based on careful scien e, good research, and a fair allocation of resources.","output":"The Stories We Tell: Narrative, Policymaking, and the Right to Try"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Following a pandemic, laboratory medicine is vulnerable to laboratory errors due to the stressful and high workloads. We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. Materials and methods: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra- and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values. Results: When the pre- and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in pre-pandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7&#963; vs. 5.4&#963;, P = 0.003). The sigma values of samples transported inappropriately and haemolysed samples were significantly higher in pre-pandemic period than during pandemic (5.0&#963; vs. 4.9&#963;, 4.3&#963; vs. 4.1&#963;; P = 0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively).

Growing populations of precarious migrants (including undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees) in the UK and Europe are considered to be under-immunised groups and may be excluded from health systems, yet little is known about their views on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, which are essential to identify key solutions and action points to strengthen vaccine roll-out. Methods: We did an in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview study of recently arrived migrants (foreign-born, >18 years old; <10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake. We used the 'Three Cs' model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising. The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630). Results: We approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (na?=a?3), asylum seekers (na?=a?19), undocumented migrants (na?=a?8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (na?=a?2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions). 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need. Participants reported a range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine and expressed concerns that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out. Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine. All participants (na?=a?10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this. Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Precarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake. Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities. These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations.

The goal of this study was to indicate transition boundaries from healthy tissue to tumors, namely, hepatic carcinoma, based on the real-time feedback derived from the optical measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five woodchucks with hepatic carcinoma were used for this study. The woodchucks were imaged with contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography with a flat panel detector C-arm system to visualize the carcinoma in the liver. In each animal, 3 insertions were performed, starting from the skin surface toward the hepatic carcinoma under image guidance. In 2 woodchucks, each end point of the insertion was confirmed with pathologic examination of a biopsy sample. While advancing the needle in the animals under image guidance such as fluoroscopy overlaid with cone beam computed tomography slice and ultrasound, optical spectra were acquired at the distal end of the needles. Optical tissue characterization was determined by translating the acquired optical spectra into clinical parameters such as blood, water, lipid, and bile fractions; tissue oxygenation levels; and scattering amplitude related to tissue density. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to study the difference in the derived clinical parameters from the measurements performed within the healthy tissue and the hepatic carcinoma. Kurtoses were calculated to assess the dispersion of these parameters within the healthy and carcinoma tissues. RESULTS Blood and lipid volume fractions as well as tissue oxygenation and reduced scattering amplitude showed to be significantly different between the healthy part of the liver and the hepatic carcinoma (P < 0.05) being higher in normal liver tissue. A decrease in blood and lipid volume fractions and tissue oxygenation as well as an increase in scattering amplitude were observed when the tip of the needle crossed the margin from the healthy liver tissue to the carcinoma. The kurtosis for each derived clinical parameter was high in the hepatic tumor as compared with that in the healthy liver indicating intracarcinoma variability. CONCLUSIONS Tissue blood content, oxygenation level, lipid content, and tissue density all showed significant differences when the needle tip was guided from the healthy tissue to the carcinoma and can therefore be used to identify tissue boundaries during percutaneous image-guided interventions.","output":"Real-Time In Vivo Characterization of Primary Liver Tumors With Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy During Percutaneous Needle Interventions: Feasibility Study in Woodchucks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trade\\\\off between within\\\\host infection rate and transmission to new hosts is predicted to constrain pathogen evolution, and to maintain polymorphism in pathogen populations.

Cross\\\\kingdom interactions are common among pathogens in both natural and cultivated systems, yet their impacts on disease ecology and evolution are rarely studied.

We performed an inoculation assay to test whether coinfection with PlLV affects performance of two P. subordinaria strains, and the correlation between within\\\\host infection rate and transmission potential. The strains differed in the measured life\\\\history traits and their correlations. Moreover, we found that under virus coinfection, within\\\\host infection rate of P. subordinaria was smaller but transmission potential was higher compared to strains under single infection. The negative correlation between within\\\\host infection rate and transmission potential detected under single infection became positive under coinfection with PlLV.

RESULTS: On day 7 of treatment, white blood cell count, CRP, and fibrinogen level were significantly lower than at admission (P = .002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively), while forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values were significantly higher compared with admitting values (P = .001 for both). Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in CRP from admission to day 7 of treatment correlated with the increase in FEV(1) (r = 0.616, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.51, P = .01) during the same period. A decrease in the fibrinogen level was also correlated with an increase in FEV(1) (r = 0.345, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.357, P = .01). CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen and CRP levels are easily accessible parameters that may help identify improvement or deterioration in pulmonary function in COVID\\\\19 patients during follow\\\\up and discharge while reducing the risk of transmission.","output":"Evaluation of the relationship between laboratory parameters and pulmonary function tests in COVID\\\\19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing restrictions, as measured by the Oxford stringency indicator, constitute the one variable that is most tightly correlated with the recession and recovery across EU member states.","output":"Social Distancing Requirements and the Determinants of the COVID-19 Recession and Recovery in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are membrane-embedded gatekeepers of traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Studying the basket was hampered by its instability and connection to the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Here, we reveal the assembly principle of the yeast NPC basket by reconstituting a recombinant Nup60-Mlp1-Nup2 scaffold on a synthetic membrane. Nup60 serves as the basket's flexible suspension cable, harboring an array of short linear motifs (SLiMs). These bind multivalently to the INM, the coiled-coil protein Mlp1, the FG-nucleoporin Nup2, and the NPC core. We suggest that SLiMs, embedded in disordered regions, allow the basket to adapt its structure in response to bulky cargo and changes in gene expression.

We compared the efficacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), nadroparin calcium, with aspirin in Asian acute stroke patients with LAOD. Methods Acute ischaemic stroke patients with onset of symptoms less than 48 h and LAOD (diagnosed by transcranial doppler imaging, carotid duplex scan, or magnetic resonance angiography) were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous nadroparin calcium 3800 anti-factor Xa IU/04 mL twice daily or oral aspirin 160 mg daily for 10 days, and then all received aspirin 80C300 mg once daily for 6 months. This study is registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials (number 493). Findings Among 603 patients recruited, 353 (180 LMWH, 173 aspirin) had LAOD (300 had intracranial LAOD only, 42 had both intracranial and extracranial disease, and 11 had extracranial disease only). The proportion of patients with good outcomes at 6 months (Barthel index 85) was 73% in the LMWH group and 69% in the aspirin group (absolute risk reduction 4%; 95% CI ?5 to 13). Analysis of prespecified secondary outcome measures showed a benefit in outcome for LMWH versus aspirin on the modified Rankin scale dichotomised at 0C1 (odds ratio 155, 95% CI 102C235). Haemorrhagic transformation of infarct and severe adverse events were similar in both groups. Post-hoc analyses of patients without LAOD, and all treated patients, showed similar proportions with a good outcome in aspirin and LMWH groups (78% vs 79% and 73% vs 75%, respectively). Interpretation Overall, the results do not support a significant benefit of LMWH over aspirin in patients with LAOD. The benefits indicated in most outcome measures warrant further investigation into the use of anticoagulation for acute stroke in patients with large artery atherosclerosis, particularly in intracranial atherosclerosis.","output":"Low-molecular-weight heparin compared with aspirin for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in Asian patients with large artery occlusive disease: a randomised study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Structural insights into -opioid receptor activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-Studium has been a long-running project of blended e-learning for higher education based on the learning management system Moodle, implemented at University of Perugia, Italy from 2005 to 2015.

The aims of this study were to assess the effects of high-flow nasal cannula on tidal volume using a noninvasive method using a time-of-flight camera, under various conditions. DESIGN A physiologic evaluation in healthy volunteers. SETTING An university hospital ICU. SUBJECTS Ten healthy volunteers were included in a physiologic study (CamOpt study, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04096183). INTERVENTIONS All volunteers were submitted to 12 different conditions (i.e., gas flow [baseline = 0; 30-60 L/min]; mouth [open/closed]; respiratory rate [baseline; baseline + 10 breaths/min]). Tidal volume measurements were performed every minute, during a 6-minute recording period. In all combinations, reference respiratory rate was measured by using chronometric evaluation, over a 30-second period (RRREF), and by using the time-of-flight camera (RRTOF). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Tidal volume increased while increasing gas flow whatever the respiratory rate and mouth condition (p < 0.001). Similar results were observed whatever the experimental conditions (p < 0.01), except one (baseline respiratory rate + 10 breaths/min and mouth closed). Tidal volume increased while decreasing respiratory rate (p < 0.001) and mouth closing (p < 0.05). Proportion of tidal volume greater than 10, 15, and 20 mL/kg changed while increasing the flow. RRTOF was in agreement with RRREF (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.96), with a low mean bias (0.55 breaths/min) and acceptable deviation. CONCLUSIONS Time-of-flight enables to detect tidal volume changes under various conditions of high-flow nasal cannula application. Tidal volume increased significantly while increasing gas flow and mouth closing.

The novel variant of concern Omicron (B.1.1.529) has to date the largest number of amino acid alterations in its Spike protein. Thus, it may efficiently escape recognition by neutralizing antibodies, allowing breakthrough infections in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. AimsWe analysed neutralization activity of all mRNA-, vector- or heterologous immunization schemes currently approved in Europe at peak response and in a longitudinal follow-up with BNT162b2 vaccinees to define immune escape potential of the Omicron VoC. MethodsWe tested sera by in vitro pseudotype particle neutralization assay towards SARS-CoV-2 B.1, Omicron, Beta and Delta Spike proteins. ResultsAll vaccines apart from Ad26.CoV2.S showed high levels of responder rates (93-100%) towards SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, but some reductions in neutralizing Beta and Delta VoC pseudotypes. The novel Omicron variant had the biggest impact, both in terms of response rates and neutralization titres among responders. Only mRNA-1273 showed a 100% response rate to Omicron and induced the highest titres of neutralizing antibodies, followed by heterologous prime-boost approaches. Homologous BNT162b2 vaccination or vector-based formulations with AZD1222 or Ad26.CoV2.S performed less well with peak responder rates of 33%, 50% and 9%, respectively. However, Omicron responder rates in BNT162b2 recipients were maintained in our six month longitudinal follow-up and even slightly increased to 47%, indicating Omicron cross-protection is maintained over time.

To achieve this, effective communication on breathing instructions for patients is crucial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiographers in Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) were challenged when performing CXR for the patients whose native language is not English. Most of these patients were foreign workers living in the same dormitory which had formed the largest COVID-19 cluster in Singapore. These dormitory residents found it difficult to understand and adhere to breathing instructions, resulting in a suboptimal degree of inspiration when the CXRs were taken. This may ultimately affect the diagnostic value of the radiographs. This paper aims to share and evaluate how radiographers tackled this issue and continued to acquire fully-inspired CXR for the dormitory residents despite the language barrier. METHODS: Using a combination of online survey and retrospective analysis of the rejection rates of CXR done over the period of early April to early June, a team of radiographers evaluated the effectiveness of using audio recordings in managing the issue of not achieving a fully inspired CXR for patients due to language barrier. RESULTS: The rejection rate for CXR due to suboptimal inspiration decreased from 26% to 9% upon implementation of the audio recordings. 92.3% of the CXRs taken within this period also fulfilled the criteria of a fully-inspired CXR, as evidenced by having at least 9 posterior ribs seen above the right hemi-diaphragm. Survey results found a fairly balanced number of radiographers who agreed and disagreed that a fully-inspired CXR was achieved for most of their patients after utilisation of translation manuals and audio recordings. CONCLUSION: After the implementation of audio recordings, the decrease in rejection rate of CXR and an audit which demonstrated that CXR quality was upheld had proven that the radiographers successfully achieved fully-inspired CXR for suspected COVID-19 patients. This confirmed that using pre-recorded audio instructions was an efficient intervention albeit being a one-way communication, leads to more accurate imaging results, aligning with existing literature on communication experiences between radiographers and patients. Moreover, the decreased rejection rate of CXRs had increased department efficiency consequently reducing departmental expenses in the long run. IMPLICATIONS OF PRACTICE: Given that we have an ageing population and the vast majority of the elderly converse in their various dialects, positive feedback from radiographers presented opportunities to expand the translation manual and audio recordings to include local dialects. These can be seamlessly integrated in CXR and other procedures in the hospital setting. To ensure that the translations are culturally sensitive, attention should be paid to the translation process of instructions into other languages and local dialects by enlisting the help of native speakers.","output":"Bridging the communication gap between radiographers and patients to improve chest radiography image acquisition: A multilingual solution in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory failure.

METHODS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 13 critically ill patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center between February 24 and April 30, 2020. Seven of these patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy using Ciaglia Blue Rhino. The medical environment, percutaneous tracheostomy method, and COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were retrospectively reviewed. After treatment, the COVID-19 infection status of healthcare personnel was investigated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The ICU contained negative pressure cohort areas and isolation rooms, and healthcare personnel wore a powered air-purifying respirator system. We performed seven cases of percutaneous tracheostomy in the same way as in patients without COVID-19. Five patients (71.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the time of tracheostomy. The median cycle threshold value for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was 30.60 (interquartile range [IQR], 25.50C36.56) in the upper respiratory tract and 35.04 (IQR, 28.40C36.74) in the lower respiratory tract.

This quality improvement project aimed to decrease antibiotic prescribing for AUB in community-based outpatient centres from 65% to <32% by April 2020. METHODS: From January to December 2018, community-based outpatient clinics 6 months average of prescribed antibiotics for AUB and upper respiratory infections was 63% (667 of 1054) and 64.6% (314 of 486) when reviewing the last 6 months. Seven planCdoCstudyCact (PDSA) cycles were implemented by an interprofessional antimicrobial stewardship team between January 2019 and March 2020. Balancing measures were a return patient phone call or visit within 4 weeks for the same complaint. (2) tests and statistical process control charts using Western Electric rules were used to analyse intervention data. RESULTS: The AUB antibiotic prescribing rate decreased from 64.6% (314 of 486) in the 6 months prior to the intervention to 36.8% (154 of 418) in the final 6 months of the intervention. No change was seen in balancing measures.

Methods: The nasopharyngeal samples collected from the two episodes were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis. Results: The first infection presented with mild symptoms, while the second infection presented with severe outcomes which occurred 74 days after the patient recovered from the first episode. He had elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, and bilateral consolidation as a sign of acute infection. Genome analysis revealed that the strains from the first and second episodes belonged to two distinct Nexstrain clades 20B and 20I and Pangolin lineages B.1.1.25 and B.1.1.7, respectively.

In the setting of immune-evading viral evolution, it is important to understand how far antibody memory recognition stretches across viral variants when memory cells are recalled to action by repeat invasions. It is also important to understand how immune recall influences longevity of secreted antibody responses. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 variant recognition, dynamics of memory B cells and secreted antibody over time after infection, vaccination, and boosting. We find that a two-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimen given after natural infection generated greater longitudinal antibody stability and induced maximal antibody magnitudes with enhanced breadth across Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. A homologous 3(rd) mRNA vaccine dose in COVID-na?ve individuals conferred greater cross-variant evenness of neutralization potency with stability that was equal to the hybrid immunity conferred by infection plus vaccination. Within unvaccinated individuals who recovered from COVID, enhanced antibody stability over time was observed within a subgroup of individuals that recovered more quickly from COVID and harbored significantly more memory B cells cross-reactive to endemic coronaviruses early after infection. These cross-reactive clones map to the conserved S2 region of SARS-CoV-2 spike with higher somatic hypermutation levels and greater target affinity. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 antigen challenge histories in humans influence not only the speed and magnitude of antibody responses, but also functional cross-variant antibody repertoire composition and longevity.","output":"Immune recall improves antibody durability and breadth to SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endovascular treatment of stroke, although highly effective, may fail to reach complete recanalization in around 20% of cases. The Advanced Thrombectomy System (ANCD) is a novel stroke thrombectomy device designed to reduce clot fragmentation and facilitate retrieval by inducing local flow arrest and allowing distal aspiration in combination with a stent retriever. We aimed to assess the preclinical efficacy of ANCD. METHODS Soft red blood cell (RBC)-rich (n=20/group) and sticky fibrin-rich (n=30/group) clots were used to create middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions in two vascular phantoms. Three different treatment strategies were tested: (1) balloon guide catheter + Solitaire (BGC+SR); (2) distal access catheter + SR (DAC+SR); and (3) ANCD+SR, until complete recanalization was achieved or to a maximum of three passes. The recanalization rate was determined after each pass. RESULTS After one pass, ANCD+SR resulted in an increased recanalization rate (94%) for all clots together compared with BGC+SR (66%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (80%; p=0.04). After the final pass the recanalization rate increased in all three groups but remained higher with ANCD+SR (100%) than with BGC+SR (74%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (90%; p=0.02). The mean number of passes was lower with ANCD+SR (1.06) than with BGC+SR (1.46) or DAC+SR (1.25) (p=0.01). A logistic regression model adjusted for treatment arm, clot type, and model used showed that both RBC-rich clots (OR 8.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 13.5) and ANCD+SR (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.8) were independent predictors of first-pass recanalization. CONCLUSION In in vitro three-dimensional models replicating MCA-M1 occlusion, ANCD+SR showed significantly better recanalization rates in fewer passes than other commonly used combinations of devices.","output":"ANCD thrombectomy device: in vitro evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced therapists and patients to physically separate and conduct sessions from afar. This created particular challenges for child and adolescent work, which tends to center around movement and embodiment. As therapists navigated the constraints of their new reality, early skepticism quickly gave way to creative, on-the-spot solutions. Born out of necessity, therapist's flexibility and accommodations brought about changes to the analytic frame that were unprecedented in scope. Common themes include the therapist's loss of control over the structure of psychotherapy, a renegotiation of therapist and patient roles, placing the parent at the center of treatment, findings new ways to play, and virtual treatment as a new mechanism for modulating closeness and intimacy in the therapeutic dyad. Rooted in clinical vignettes of clinicians from the early weeks of the pandemic, this paper will illustrate these themes and consider their implications for the future of psychotherapy with children and adolescents.

However, reduced-port surgery for ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial. Here, we describe the clinical outcomes of single-incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery (SILS + 1) for medically uncontrolled UC. METHODS Between May 2011 and September 2014, 10 UC patients underwent SILS + 1 port surgery. All procedures were performed with the use of a SILS port and either a 5-mm or a 12-mm port placed at the planned ileostomy site. RESULTS The median age of patients was 32 years (range, 22-53 years). Six patients underwent two-stage SILS + 1 port restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, two patients underwent SILS + 1 total proctocolectomy, and the remaining two patients underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy with subsequent three-stage SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The median operative time was 363.1 min (range, 253-465 min) and the median estimated blood loss was 29 mL (range, 0-100 mL). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Two patients previously underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy, and in one of those patients, SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed successfully 6 months after the previous surgery. There were no intra-abdominal adhesions, and no extra wounds were necessary because the previous stoma site had been used to access the SILS port. The median postoperative period was 24 months, during which five patients had their ileostomies closed. No patients reported occasional minor daily soiling or the need to wear a pad. CONCLUSION Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery for medically uncontrolled UC is a feasible and safe procedure when performed by skilled surgeons.","output":"Does reduced-port laparoscopic surgery for medically uncontrolled ulcerative colitis do more harm than good?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Bacterial lung microbiota are correlated with lung inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and altered in severe COVID-19. However, the association between lung microbiota (including fungi) and resolution of ARDS in COVID-19 remains unclear. We hypothesized that increased lung bacterial and fungal burdens are related to non-resolving ARDS and mortality in COVID-19. OBJECTIVES To determine the relation between lung microbiota and clinical outcomes of COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS This observational cohort study enrolled mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. All patients had ARDS and underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Lung microbiota were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR targeting the 16S and 18S rRNA genes. Key features of lung microbiota (bacterial and fungal burden, -diversity and community composition) served as predictors. Our primary outcome was successful extubation adjudicated 60 days after intubation, analyzed using a competing risk regression model with mortality as competing risk. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS BAL samples of 114 unique COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients with increased lung bacterial and fungal burden were less likely to be extubated (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.42-0.97], p=0.034 and 0.59 [95% CI 0.42-0.83], p=0.0027 per log10 increase in bacterial and fungal burden, respectively) and had higher mortality (bacterial burden p=0.012, fungal burden p=0.0498). Lung microbiota composition was associated with successful extubation (p=0.0045). Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-) were associated with the microbial burdens. CONCLUSIONS Bacterial and fungal lung microbiota are related to non-resolving ARDS in COVID-19, and represent an important contributor to heterogeneity in COVID-19-related ARDS.

One mechanism for sending medical data is to send information to other medical centers without preserving confidentiality. This method is not impressive because in treating people, the privacy of medical information is a principle. In the proposed framework, the opinion of experts from other medical centers for the treatment of patients is received and consider the best therapy. The proposed method has two layers. In the first layer, data transmission uses blockchain. In the second layer, blocks related to patients records analyze by machine learning methods. Patient records place in a block of the blockchain. Block of patient sends to other medical centers. Each treatment center can recommend the proposed type of treatment and blockchain attachment and send it to all nodes and treatment centers. Each medical center receiving data of the patients, then predicts the treatment using data mining methods. Sending medical data between medical centers with blockchain and maintaining confidentiality is one of the innovations of this article. The proposed method is a binary version of the HHO algorithm for feature selection. Another innovation of this research is the use of majority voting learning in diagnosing the type of disease in medical centers. Implementation of the proposed system shows that the blockchain preserves data confidentiality of about 100%. The reliability and reliability of the proposed framework are much higher than the centralized method. The result shows that the accuracy, sensitivity, and precision of the proposed method for diagnosing heart disease are 92.75%, 92.15%, and 95.69%, respectively.

The frustrating thing is that, right now, this virus is still new. It only came to the attention of the World Health Organization at the end of December. Very few cases in thalassemia have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? However, we believe that more data should be collected to better characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with thalassemias. Therefore, a multicenter registry and the collection of comprehensive data from both positive COVID-19 thalassemia major and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia are necessary to clarify debated issues.

Here, for the first time, we summarized and quantitatively analyzed studies on the diagnosis of heterogeneous diseases on the basis on facial features. In pooled data from 20 systematically identified studies involving 7 single diseases and 12,557 subjects, quantitative random-effects models revealed a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 82% to 93%) and a pooled specificity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 95%). A new index, the facial recognition intensity (FRI), was established to describe the complexity of the association of diseases with facial phenotypes. Meta-regression revealed the important contribution of FRI to heterogeneous diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.021), and a similar result was found in subgroup analyses (p = 0.003). An appropriate increase in the training size and the use of deep learning models helped to improve the diagnostic accuracy for diseases with low FRI, although no statistically significant association was found between accuracy and photographic resolution, training size, AI architecture, and number of diseases.

The number of confirmed cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 continues to escalate with over 70 million confirmed cases and over 1.6 million confirmed deaths. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulated host immune response to the virus, which is thought to lead to pathogenic immune dysregulation and end-organ damage. Presently few effective treatment options are available to treat COVID-19. Leronlimab is a humanized IgG4, kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks CCC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). It has been shown that in patients with severe COVID-19 treatment with leronlimab reduces elevated plasma IL-6 and chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and normalized CD4/CD8 ratios. We administered leronlimab to 4 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care. All 4 of these patients improved clinically as measured by vasopressor support, and discontinuation of hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation. Following administration of leronlimab there was a statistically significant decrease in IL-6 observed in patient A (p=0.034) from day 0C7 and patient D (p=0.027) from day 0C14. This corresponds to restoration of the immune function as measured by CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio.

DESIGN: Survey of ICU directors or delegated senior clinicians (disseminated 30 August 2021), supplemented by Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data. SETTING: All 194 public and private Australian ICUs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of currently available and potentially available ICU beds in case of a surge; available levels of ICU\\\\relevant equipment and staff. RESULTS: All 194 ICUs responded to the survey. The total number of currently open staffed ICU beds was 2183. This was 195 fewer (8.2%) than in 2020; the decline was greater for rural/regional (18%) and private ICUs (18%). The reported maximal ICU bed capacity (5623) included 813 additional physical ICU bed spaces and 2627 in surge areas outside ICUs. The number of available ventilators (7196) exceeded the maximum number of ICU beds. The reported number of available additional nursing staff would facilitate the immediate opening of 383 additional physical ICU beds (47%), but not the additional bed spaces outside ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: The number of currently available staffed ICU beds is lower than in 2020. Equipment shortfalls have been remediated, with sufficient ventilators to equip every ICU bed.

It remains unclear if its rapid growth exacerbates disparities in healthcare access. We aimed to characterize telemedicine use among a large oncology population in the Deep South during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed at the only National Cancer Institute designated-cancer center in Alabama March 2020 to December 2020. With a diverse (26.5% Black, 61% rural) population, this southeastern demographic uniquely reflects historically vulnerable populations. All non-procedural visits at the cancer center from March to December 2020 were included in this study excluding those with a department that had fewer than 100 visits during this time period. Patient and clinic level characteristics were analyzed using t-test and Chi-square to compare characteristics between visit types (in-person versus telemedicine, and video versus audio within telemedicine). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify independent factors associated with telemedicine use and type of telemedicine use. RESULTS There were 50 519 visits and most were in-person (81.3%). Among telemedicine visits, most were phone based (58.3%). Black race and male sex predicted in-person visits. Telemedicine visits were less likely to have video among patients who were Black, older, male, publicly insured, and from lower income areas. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine use, specifically with video, is significantly lower among historically vulnerable populations. Understanding barriers to telemedicine use and preferred modalities of communication among different populations will help inform insurance reimbursement and interventions at different socioecological levels to ensure the continued evolution of telemedicine is equitable.","output":"Inequity in Telemedicine Use Among Patients with Cancer in the Deep South During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are at the forefront of nucleic acid intracellular delivery, as exemplified by the recent emergency approval of two mRNA LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines. The success of an LNP product largely depends on the systematic optimisation of the four lipidic components, namely the ionisable lipid, PEG lipid, structural and helper lipids. However, the in vitro screening of novel lipidic components and LNP compositions is limited by the low-throughput of LNP preparation. To address these issues, we herein present an automated high-throughput screening platform to select novel ionisable lipids and corresponding LNPs encapsulating mRNA in vitro. This high-throughput platform employs a lab-based automated liquid handling system, amenable to high-throughput (up to 384 formulations per plate and several plates per run) and allows precise mixing and reproducible mRNA LNP preparation which ensures a direct head-to-head comparison of hundreds and even thousands of novel LNPs. Most importantly, the robotic process has been successfully applied to the screening of novel LNPs encapsulating mRNA and has identified the same novel mRNA LNP leads as those from microfluidics-mixing technology, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8751. This high-throughput platform can facilitate to narrow down the number of novel ionisable lipids to be evaluated in vivo. Moreover, this platform has been integrated into a fully-automated workflow for LNP property control, physicochemical characterisation and biological evaluation. The high-throughput platform may accelerate proprietary lipid development, mRNA LNP lead optimisation and candidate selection to advance preclinical mRNA LNP development to meet urgent global needs.","output":"Development of a high-throughput platform for screening lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus.

In this study, we perform support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping using a brain tumor model to test the hypothesis that brain regions specifically involved in lexical retrieval from visual and auditory stimuli represent overlapping neural systems. We find that principal components analysis of language tasks revealed multicollinearity between picture naming, auditory naming, and a validated measure of word finding, implying the existence of redundant cognitive constructs. Nonparametric, multivariate lesion-symptom mapping across participants was used to model accuracies on each of the four language tasks.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 4,141 COVID-19 patients who were released from isolation or had died as of April 30, 2020. This nationwide data was provided by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency. BMI was categorized as follows; < 18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-22.9 kg/m2, 23.0-24.9 kg/m2, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and &#8805; 30 kg/m2. We defined a fatal illness if the patient had died. RESULTS: Among participants, those with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m2 were the most common (42.0%), followed by 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (24.4%), 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (24.3%), &#8805; 30 kg/m2 (4.7%), and < 18.5 kg/m2 (4.6%). In addition, 1,654 (41.2%) were men and 3.04% were fatalities. Multivariable analysis showed that age, male sex, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and dementia were independent risk factors for fatal illness. In particular, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.97, 95% CI 1.77-8.92), 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (2.43, 1.32-4.47), and &#8805; 30 kg/m2 (4.32, 1.37-13.61) were found to have higher ORs than the BMI of 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 (reference).

Randomized controlled trials of pharmacological, sedation, non-pharmacological, and multi-component interventions enrolling adult critically ill patients were included. We performed conventional pairwise meta-analyses, NMA within Bayesian random effects modeling, and determined surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and mean rank. Reviewer pairs independently extracted data, assessed bias using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evidence certainty with GRADE. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence; secondary outcomes were durations of delirium and mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Eighty trials met eligibility criteria: 67.5% pharmacological, 31.3% non-pharmacological and 1.2% mixed pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. For delirium occurrence, 11 pharmacological interventions (38 trials, N = 11,993) connected to the evidence network. Compared to placebo, only dexmedetomidine (21/22 alpha(2) agonist trials were dexmedetomidine) probably reduces delirium occurrence (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) 0.21C0.85; moderate certainty).

Single and multi-component non-pharmacological interventions did not connect to any evidence networks to allow for ranking and comparisons as planned; pairwise comparisons did not detect differences compared to standard care. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo and benzodiazepines, we found dexmedetomidine likely reduced the occurrence of delirium in critically ill adults. Compared to benzodiazepines, sedation-minimization strategies may also reduce delirium occurrence, but the evidence is uncertain.

However, the effects of DTMUV on duck immunological components and functions remain largely unknown. In this study, the dynamics of cellular and humoral immune responses of DTMUV-infected ducks were investigated. The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and non-T and B lymphocytes as well as the levels of neutralizing antibodies were quantified in parallel with DTMUV loads in blood and target organs. Our results demonstrated that DTMUV infection caused severe losses of non-T and B lymphocyte/myeloid cell subpopulation, and reduction in phagocytic activity during 3-5 days after infection. We also found that the numbers of T and B cells were increased during the first week of DTMUV infection. A significant negative correlation between the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and non-T and B lymphocytes and viral loads in blood and target organ (spleen) was observed during the early phase of infection. Additionally, DTMUV infection induced an early and robust neutralizing antibody response, which was associated with DTMUV-specific IgM and IgG responses. The presence of neutralizing antibody also correlated with reduction of viremia and viral load in spleen. Overall, DTMUV elicited both cellular and humoral immune responses upon infection, in which the magnitude of these responses was correlated with reduction of viremia and viral loads in the target organ (spleen). The results suggested the critical role of both cellular and humoral immunity against DTMUV infection.

Patients with schizophrenia are not participatory and have increased mortality and morbidity, patients with dementia cannot be cared for while depression, anxiety, bipolar tubing are associated with low immune status. Social stress is amplified by social isolation, amplifying depression and the mechanisms of decreased immunity. Hygiene measures and prophylactic behavior are impossible to put into practice in conditions of chronic mental illness. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the risk for severe development is associated with the presence of comorbidities and immune system deficiency. Prothrombotic status, cytokine storm and alveolar destruction are mechanisms that aggravate the evolution of patients, especially in the context in which they have dysfunction of the autonomic system. The activity of proinflammatory cytokines is accentuated by hyperglutamatergia, which potentiates oxidative stress and triggers the mechanisms of neural apoptosis by stimulating microglial activation. Activation of M1-type microglia has an important role in pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and may associate hippocampal atrophy and disconnection of cognitive structures. Memantine and Amantadine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor inhibitors, have demonstrated, through their pharmacological profile, psychotropic effects but also antiviral properties. In the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on these arguments, we suggest that they can be associated with the therapy with the basic psychotropics, Memantine or Amantadine, for the control of neuropsychiatric symptoms but also as adjuvants with antiviral action.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with serious mental illness and possible benefits of prophylaxis with Memantine and Amantadine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Guidelines for the management of large vessel vasculitides have been recently updated by several scientific societies. We have evaluated the current recommendations for treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TA) and addressed potential future therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: While glucocorticoids (GCs) remain the gold standard for induction of remission, many patients relapse and acquire high cumulative GC exposure. Thus, GC-sparing therapies such as methotrexate are recommended for selected patients with GCA and all patients with TA. Recent high-quality evidence shows that tocilizumab is an effective GC-sparing agent in GCA. Non-biologic and biologic immunomodulators also appear to have GC-sparing properties in TA.

Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swabs) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (three hospitals and three public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID hospital but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplet traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions, and fecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by qPCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment. IMPORTANCE Several studies have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Saliva and nasopharyngeal droplets can land on objects and surfaces, creating fomites. A suitable indicator would allow the detection of droplets or biofluids carrying the virus. Therefore, we searched for viral RNA and droplets and fomites on at risk surfaces. We monitored by qPCR or next generation sequencing (NGS) droplets through their microbiota. Although the study was performed during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly found on surfaces, with the only exception of environmental areas near infectious patients. Conversely, anthropic contamination was frequent, suggesting a role for biofluids as putative markers of indirect transmission and risk assessment. Moreover, all SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces showed droplets microbiota. Fomite monitoring by qPCR may have an impact on public health strategies, supporting prevention of indirect transmission similarly to what is done for other communicable diseases (e.g., influenza and influenza-like infections).","output":"Monitoring COVID-19 Transmission Risks by Quantitative Real-Time PCR Tracing of Droplets in Hospital and Living Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, there has been a breakthrough in immunotherapy.

To generate higher quality, more cost-effective, and less time-consuming measures, it is necessary to explore dual- or multi-method strategy toward sampling optimization, improvement of measurement, and enhancement of efficiency. To justify the proposed dual-method approach, the study has three major objectives. First, it examines the uncertainties associated with different sample sizes by using GIS to generate scenarios that contrast the validity of measurements to aid sampling optimization in auditing. Second, it compares the validity of GIS measures with those generated through Google Street View Auditing (GSVA) by human raters. Third, it further examines the efficiency of the proposed dual-method approach in comparison to the two individual methods. Such investigation generates several novel findings. First, the study presents important evidence to support that GIS measures can offer sampling guidance applicable to the GSVA method. It leads to a recommendation of sampling sizes (5%-20%) for cases in settings with a mixture of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results further indicate that different communities and certain individual features and characteristics may demand different sampling practices. Second, the study found that while GSVA is trustworthy for most characteristic variables, especially those that required subjective input, GIS provides well-validated measures for certain objective environmental attributes. Furthermore, the study reports that a dual-method approach of GIS and GSVA had a lower financial and time burden than using GSVA alone and is thus recommended as a comprehensive solution for optimal measurement of an objective built environment in mixed urban neighborhoods.","output":"A dual-method approach toward measuring the built environment - sampling optimization, validity, and efficiency of using GIS and virtual auditing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a mutation of the NPC1 or NPC2 gene, in which un-esterified cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen, and brain. Abnormal lysosomal storage leads to cell damage, neurological problems, and premature death. The time of onset and severity of symptoms of NPC disease are highly variable. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for NPC disease pathology are far from being understood. The present study generated and characterized a zebrafish mutant that lacks Npc2 protein that may be useful for studies at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels and both small-scale and high-throughput screens. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the zebrafish homolog of NPC2. Five-day-old npc2 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wildtype larvae. We found that live npc2(C/C) larvae exhibited stronger Nile blue staining. The npc2(C/C) larvae exhibited low mobility and a high anxiety-related response. These behavioral changes correlated with downregulation of the mcu (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) gene, ppp3ca (calcineurin) gene, and genes that are involved in myelination (mbp and mpz). Histological analysis of adult npc2(C/C) zebrafish revealed that pathological changes in the nervous system, kidney, liver, and pancreas correlated with inflammatory responses (i.e., the upregulation of il1, nfʦ, and mpeg; i.e., hallmarks of NPC disease).

This feasibility study aimed to gather the essential data needed to design and power a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of a digital intervention in reducing the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy. In order to do this, we carried out a single-centre RCT, which explored the knowledge, attitudes and risk reduction behaviours in women in the intervention and treatment as usual groups, pre- and post-intervention. METHODS CMV seronegative women living with a child less than four years old, receiving antenatal care at a single UK tertiary centre, were randomised to the digital intervention or 'treatment as usual' groups. Participants completed questionnaires before the digital intervention and after and at 34 gestational weeks, and responses within groups and between groups were compared using tailored randomisation tests. CMV serology was tested in the first trimester and at the end of pregnancy. RESULTS Of the 878 women screened, 865 samples were analysed with 43% (n = 372) being CMV seronegative and therefore eligible to take part in the RCT; of these, 103 (27.7%) women were enrolled and 87 (84%) of these completed the study. Most participants (n = 66; 64%) were unfamiliar with CMV at enrolment, however at 34 gestational weeks, women in the intervention group (n = 51) were more knowledgeable about CMV compared to the treatment as usual group (n = 52) and reported engaging in activities that may increase the risk of CMV transmission less frequently. The digital intervention was highly acceptable to pregnant women. Overall, four participants seroconverted over the course of the study: two from each study group. CONCLUSIONS A large multi-centre RCT investigating the efficacy of a CMV digital intervention is feasible in the United Kingdom; this study has generated essential data upon which to power such a study. This single-centre feasibility RCT demonstrates that a digital educational intervention is associated with increase in knowledge about CMV and can result in behaviour change which may reduce the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy.

Afterwards, the chest CT findings were recorded and three radiologists recorded their diagnoses of COVID-19 or of H1N1 influenza based on the CT findings. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical symptom in patients with COVID-19 and H1N1 pneumonia were dyspnea (96.6%) and cough (62.5%), respectively. The CT findings showed that the COVID-19 group was characterized by GGO (88.1%), while the influenza group had features such as GGO (68.4%) and consolidation (66.7%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have GGO (88.1% vs. 68.4%, p = 0.032), subpleural sparing (69.0% vs. 7.7%, p <0.001) and subpleural band (50.0% vs. 20.5%, p = 0.006), but less likely to have pleural effusion (4.8% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.001).

to health care is free in Australia, access to lung cancer treatments is not always affordable or timely, especially for a rare cancer patient like the author Diagnosed with ROS1+ NSCLC, the author had to crowdfund to pay for her first targeted therapy the price of which exceeded what most Australians could afford Acutely aware that her participation in a subsequent clinical trial is uncommon for someone with a similar minority background, the author seeks to explore the concept of patient experience in the context of diversity and inequity Patient experience is multidimensional and integrated The quality and safety of services provided, the costs incurred, and the outcomes achieved are all important facets of the patient experience [1] The ultimate goals of advocates are to achieve optimal patient experience by ensuring that patients needs are heard, and problems are resolved To do this effectively, advocates must understand the unmet needs of the patients they seek to represent However, lung cancer patient experience is not homogenous and is impacted by social determinants In Australia, lung cancer outcomes differ across socioeconomic status (SES), indigenous status and remoteness For example: (a) the incidence rates of lung cancer in 2010-14 were 27% higher in remote and very remote areas combined, compared to major Australian cities;(b) the mortality rate was highest in the lowest SES areas (SES1, 38 5 per 100,000 persons), compared to the highest SES areas (SES5, 20 1 per 100,000 persons);and (c) the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer in 2010-2014 was 8 5% for Indigenous Australians compared to 14 2% for non-Indigenous Australians [2] Health inequities exist both within and among countries [3], so the lung cancer patient experience would no doubt also differ within and between countries The aim of this presentation is to draw insights from the authors lung cancer patient experience as well as patient anecdotes from other countries and continents Method: Three separate interviews were conducted through a cloud-based video conference service The interviewees were asked to share stories of lung cancer patient experience in their country, observations on key areas of improvement, and comments on how the global lung cancer community can support them Results: The interviewees comprised of two female lung cancer patients from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and a male lung cancer advocate from Nigeria Interview 1: Experience from The Netherlands: The insights of the patient advocate from the Netherlands were mostly very positive She described her experience of free access to healthcare, timely and free access to treatment, optimal level of nursing care, and integrated psychosocial services While there remains is a need to address stigma systematically and collaboratively, the interviewee observes that lung cancer care in the Netherlands may be held as a model for healthcare Interview 2: Experience from New Zealand: The anecdotes shared by the patient advocate from New Zealand somewhat differ While access to healthcare is free, most lung cancer patients are treated by general oncologists The patient advocates key area of concern is the limited access to biomarker testing, treatment options and clinicals trials She calls on the global lung cancer community to raise awareness about the lack of treatment options in New Zealand Interview 3: Experience from Nigeria: The third interview was with a former caregiver and advocate from Nigeria provided anecdotes and observations that were drastically different from the others Tragically, because healthcare costs are not subsidized and can be prohibitive, many people do not get diagnosed at all If diagnosed, a lung cancer patient would attend a general cancer clinic to see a general oncologist Treatment options are very limited as there is currently no access to any lung cancer biomarker testing, targeted therapy or immunotherapy There are currently no lung cancer clinical trials in Nigeria The interviewee descr bed feelings of sadness and despair when watching presentations on global lung cancer research and medical advancements He believes that the first step to tackle the dire position of lung cancer patients in Nigeria and Africa is to understand the current standard of lung cancer care in these respective areas He calls on the global community to provide support in that regard Conclusion: Lung cancer patient experience is not only multidimensional but also diverse The key insights drawn from the interviews are that, to ensure a comprehensive lung cancer patient experience, it is crucial that: (a) lung cancer advocates are aware and mindful of social determinants as well as issues that can significantly impact on patient outcomes, including inequity, accessibility, resourcing and poverty;(b) lung cancer researchers, clinicians and policy makers actively address disparities by engaging with a wide variety of patients and caregivers in their work;and (c) the lung cancer global community is sensitive to the impact of accelerating medical advancements on the widening gap of global health inequities, and ensure that all communication is appropriately respectful The reduction of inequities is a moral obligation [4] It may be difficult to comprehend in the year of the dawn of COVID-19, but it is time for us to advance beyond just tackling diseases It is our collective ethical responsibility to consider the whole patient experience in all aspects of lung cancer care, and to do so through the lenses of health inequities As the World Health Organisation states [r]educing health inequities is an ethical imperative Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale  [5]

Some tiered classifications have been put forward aimed at prioritizing patients by using criteria related with clinical severity or social impact of stone disease, yet no quantitative system has been published to date. The objective of this study is to present a new quantitative scoring system for elective stone surgery prioritization and show its intra- and inter-rater reliability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A scoring system coined SCQCscore was set up, which consists of 9 variables: infection (ranges 0C3), obstruction (0C3), indwelling time (0C3), admissions (0C3), symptoms (0C2), ureteral location (0C1), solitary or suboptimal kidney (0C1), chronic kidney disease (0C1) and presence of percutaneous nephrostomy (0C1). The intra- and inter-rater reliability of the SCQ-score was prospectively validated in 60 consecutive patients on the waiting list, by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The SCQ-score demonstrated having an excellent interobserver agreement (ICC >0.75) for the final score and its different domains. After 4 weeks, a second analysis was carried out to measure its intra-rater reliability, which was also excellent. On average, 134.9 50 seconds were required to complete the SCQ-score. CONCLUSIONS: The SCQ-score is a new quantitative system to help prioritize elective stone surgeries, which has been shown to be user-friendly and to have an excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability. Initially developed to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, its utility will probably remain of interest in the post-COVID-19 era to ensure a fairer access to stone surgery.","output":"The SCQ-SCORE: initial validation of a new scoring system for elective stone surgery prioritization in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly and this scenario is concerning in South America, mainly in Brazil with more than seven million cases of infection.

Clade G was the most prevalent in Ecuador, Suriname, and Uruguay, clade GR in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, and clade GH in Colombia. The phylodynamic analysis indicated that all these main lineages increased viral spreading from February to early March and after an evolutionary stationary phase was observed. The decrease observed in the virus dissemination was directly associated to the reduction of social movement after March. In conclusion, these data demonstrated the current predominance of clades G, GR, and GH in South America because of the early dissemination of them in the first pandemic phase in South America.","output":"Dissemination and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the early pandemic phase in South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a fundamental gene expression event in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It allows production of essential viral, structural and replicative enzymes that are encoded in an alternative reading frame. Despite the importance of PRF for the viral life cycle, it is still largely unknown how and to what extent cellular factors alter mechanical properties of frameshift elements and thereby impact virulence. This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element and the host proteome. We reveal that the short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and inhibits viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA element. Together, these data identify ZAP-S as a host-encoded inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and expand our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation.","output":"The short isoform of the host antiviral protein ZAP acts as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of telemedicine technology and to discuss the role of legislation in the application of telemedicine technology within the scope of COVID-19.

Although there is no distinct definition or detailed knowledge about AECOPD, it is commonly used as primary outcome in clinical studies. Furthermore, it may be difficult in clinical practice to differentiate the worsening of symptoms due to an AECOPD or to the development of heart failure. Therefore, it is of major clinical importance to investigate the underlying pathophysiology, and if possible, predictors of an AECOPD and thus to identify patients who are at high risk for developing an acute exacerbation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In total, 355 patients with COPD will be included prospectively to this study during a 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme at the Schoen Klinik Berchtesgadener Land, Schoenau am Koenigssee (Germany). All patients will be closely monitored from admission to discharge. Lung function, exercise tests, clinical parameters, quality of life, physical activity and symptoms will be recorded, and blood samples and exhaled air will be collected. If a patient develops an AECOPD, there will be additional comprehensive diagnostic assessments to differentiate between cardiac, pulmonary or cardiopulmonary causes of worsening. Follow-up measures will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months. Exploratory data analyses methods will be used for the primary research question (screening and identification of possible factors to predict an AECOPD). Regression analyses and a generalised linear model with a binomial outcome (AECOPD) will be applied to test if predictors are significant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Philipps University Marburg, Germany (No. 61/19). The results will be presented in conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS: We included 102 patients with COVID\\\\19 receiving various levels of respiratory support admitted to general wards, intermediate units, or intensive care units and collected plasma samples shortly after hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with COVID\\\\19 with higher respiratory support had increased in vivo activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, as reflected by higher plasma levels of d\\\\dimer, thrombin\\\\antithrombin, and plasmin\\\\antiplasmin complexes as compared to patients with no to minimal respiratory support and healthy controls.

The aim of this article was to present representative troublesome cases related to the manipulation of donor arteries (DAs) and recipient arteries during low-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass. METHODS: In the past 5 years, 507 low-flow bypass surgeries were performed in patients with cerebral aneurysms, moyamoya disease, and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Frustrating perioperative situations were retrospectively reviewed, and 6 representative cases were described. RESULTS: Case 1 involved repeat microanastomosis owing to occlusion of the anastomotic segment by thrombus formation. Case 2 involved repair of the DA injured by thermal energy. Case 3 involved direct repair of the DA damaged by a sharp knife. Case 4 involved repeat microanastomosis owing to avulsion of the anastomotic segment. Case 5 involved lengthening of the short DA with a nearby interposition graft. Case 6 involved use of retrograde flow via the distal segment of the DA secondary to the injury of the proximal segment of the DA. In all patients, rescue procedures were successful, and bypass flow was patent with no relevant complications.

Experimental studies show that N501Y enhances viral binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and confers moderate resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A mechanistic understanding of this mutation remains elusive. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and alchemical free energy calculations, to systematically evaluate the effects of this prominent substitution on recognizing the host receptor ACE2 and different types of neutralizing mAbs. Our results suggest that this mutation alters the delicate local interaction with its binding partners: Y501 enhances local hydrophobicity, strengthens interaction with neighbouring K353 and Y41, and yields a Delta Delta G(binding) value of about -0.9 kcal mol(-1) to human ACE2, in quantitative agreement with the experimental measurement. Yet, N501Y diminishes the binding to cat ACE2 due to steric clash, indicating distinct transmissibility in different species. Meanwhile, the bulky Y501 reduces the binding to the antibody CB6 by about 4 folds, confirming recent experimental results. Intriguingly, the N501Y substitution fuses a larger hydrophobic core and sensitizes the binding to H014, which makes the viral strain more vulnerable to this typical antibody. The present study portraits the chemical nature of protein-protein interaction due to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutation at atomic resolution and enlightens future investigations of other variants and vaccine design.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N501Y mutation causes differential species transmissibility and antibody sensitivity: a molecular dynamics and alchemical free energy study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and panic disorder (PD) among citizens in 11 countries during the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, a formalised, representative measure of food insecurity was not collected in the UK until 2019, over a decade after the initial proliferation of food bank demand. In the absence of a direct measure of food insecurity, this article identifies and summarises longitudinal proxy indicators of UK food insecurity to gain insight into the growth of insecure access to food in the 21st century. Methods: A rapid evidence synthesis of academic and grey literature (2005Cpresent) identified candidate proxy longitudinal markers of food insecurity. These were assessed to gain insight into the prevalence of, or conditions associated with, food insecurity. Results: Food bank data clearly demonstrates increased food insecurity. However, this data reflects an unrepresentative, fractional proportion of the food insecure population without accounting for mild/moderate insecurity, or those in need not accessing provision. Economic indicators demonstrate that a period of poor overall UK growth since 2005 has disproportionately impacted the poorest households, likely increasing vulnerability and incidence of food insecurity. This vulnerability has been exacerbated by welfare reform for some households. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically intensified vulnerabilities and food insecurity. Diet-related health outcomes suggest a reduction in diet quantity/quality. The causes of diet-related disease are complex and diverse;however, evidence of socio-economic inequalities in their incidence suggests poverty, and by extension, food insecurity, as key determinants. Conclusion: Proxy measures of food insecurity suggest a significant increase since 2005, particularly for severe food insecurity. Proxy measures are inadequate to robustly assess the prevalence of food insecurity in the UK. Failure to collect standardised, representative data at the point at which food bank usage increased significantly impairs attempts to determine the full prevalence of food insecurity, understand the causes, and identify those most at risk.","output":"Proxy longitudinal indicators of household food insecurity in the UK: [version 1;peer review: 1 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension remains the leading cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide and disproportionately impacts patients living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the evidence for telemedicine interventions for blood pressure management in LMICs and assess the relationships between the telemedicine intervention characteristics and clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Published studies were identified from the following databases (from their inception to May 2020): PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Search terms related to Low and Middle Income Countries, Telemedicine, and Hypertension were used, and clinical outcomes were extracted from the screened articles. RESULTS: Our search resulted in 530 unique articles, and 14 studies were included in this review. Five studies assessed telemedicine interventions for patient-provider behavioral counseling, four assessed patient-provider medical management, and five assessed provider-provider consultation technologies. Out of fourteen individual studies, eleven demonstrated a significant improvement in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in the intervention group. Of the eight studies that reported difference-in-differences changes in systolic blood pressure, between-arm differences ranged from 13.2 mmHg to 0.4 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the studies in this review demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure with use of the telemedicine intervention, though the magnitude of benefit was not consistently large. Limitations of the studies included small sample sizes, short duration, and intervention heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests that telemedicine may provide a promising approach to increase access to care and improve outcomes for hypertension in LMICs, especially during events that limit access to in-person care, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We examined available literature and offered practical recommendations to support evidence-based practice, policymaking, and further investigations. METHODS: Four thousand eight hundred sixty-three unique records identified in Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ProQuest (Health and Medicine) were screened for studies that recruited cancer patients, assessed the co-location of exercise service and cancer treatment units, and reported findings on service implementation. Evidence from six studies providing data from over 30 programs was integrated using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Service implementation was relatively modest across the included studies. Exercise services were delivered by physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, and kinesiologists and funded mainly through grants and private donations, with staff salaries accruing as the major expense. Service penetration, adoption, and acceptability were generally low. However, studies recorded high clinician/patient satisfaction. Major barriers to service integration were limited funding, lack of detailed implementation plan, and low organizational buy-in. Common reasons for non-utilization, missed sessions, and dropouts were lack of interest, unwellness, hospital readmission, disease progression, and adverse skeletal events. CONCLUSION: Implementing exercise services in clinical oncology settings seems an effective approach for increasing access to exercise-based rehabilitation for individuals on cancer treatment. While this model appears feasible for patients/clinicians, efforts are required to optimize service integration both in the short and long term. Key priorities include seeking [local] actions to address issues relating to funding and organizational buy-in. Important considerations may include developing an implementation plan to guide the implementation process, expanding the patient core management team to include staff from the exercise rehabilitation unit, and exploring the role of patient feedback in increasing clinician participation (e.g., treating oncologists and nurses) in the referral process. Future research should consider effective strategies to promote patients sense of self-efficacy and behavioral control and, further, the place of audit and feedback in improving exercise service delivery and overall service implementation.

Here, we reported a case of pNET producing vasopressin in a 78-year-old man with hyponatremia. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient presented with anorexia approximately 4 years ago, and the laboratory test results indicated hyponatremia. He was hospitalized 3 times subsequently due to anorexia in the past 4 years, during which laboratory tests consistently indicated severe hyponatremia. DIAGNOSIS: Upon admission, his serum osmolarity, urine osmolarity, urine sodium level, and 24-hour urine sodium level was 277 mOsm/kg H2O, 465 mOsm/kg H2O, 82.5 mmol/L, and 140.25 mmol, respectively. Gallium-68-labeled tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid-Dphel-Tyr3-octreotate positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed a high uptake lesion measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter in the pancreatic body, and the possibility of pNET was considered. Besides, laboratory tests showed that adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone released by the pituitary was insufficient in the case of low levels of cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Thus, the diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) was considered along with hypopituitarism.

One of the efforts to tackle COVID-19 transmission is by carrying out community activities. This has an effect on business activities which in turn has an impact on the economy. The economic downturn due to COVID-19 has an impact on increasing the poor population in Indonesia. One of the steps taken by the government in dealing with COVID-19 is by providing social assistance that is prioritized by poor families. The factor that becomes a problem in implementing a program is the right information and the accuracy of the recipient is not right on target.

This study was conducted to compare efficacy and safety outcomes of darunavir-cobicistat versus lopinavir-ritonavir in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted on adult patients hospitalized in one of the COVID-19 facilities in Qatar. Patients were included if they received darunavir-cobicistat or lopinavir-ritonavir for at least three days as part of their COVID-19 treatments. Data were collected from patients electronic medical records. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of time to clinical improvement and/or virological clearance. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used at alpha level of 0.05. A total of 400 patients was analyzed, of whom 100 received darunavir-cobicistat and 300 received lopinavir-ritonavir. Majority of patients were male (92.5%), with a mean (SD) time from symptoms onset to start of therapy of 7.57 days (4.89). Patients received lopinavir-ritonavir had significantly faster time to clinical improvement and/or virological clearance than patients received darunavir-cobicistat (4 days [IQR 3C7] vs. 6.5 days [IQR 4C12]; HR 1.345 [95%CI: 1.070C1.691], P = 0.011). Patients received lopinavir-ritonavir had significantly faster time to clinical improvement (5 days [IQR 3C8] vs. 8 days [IQR 4C13]; HR 1.520 (95%CI: 1.2C1.925), P = 0.000), and slower time to virological clearance than darunavir-cobicistat (25 days [IQR 15C33] vs. 21 days [IQR 12.8C30]; HR 0.772 (95%CI: 0.607C0.982), P = 0.035). No significant difference in the incidence or severity of adverse events between groups. The study was limited to its retrospective nature and the possibility of covariates, which was accounted for by multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, early treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was associated with faster time to clinical improvement and/or virological clearance than darunavir-cobicistat.

Seedlings of Z. serrata were exposed to four salt levels in a greenhouse with and without F. mosseae inoculation. Treatment comparisons revealed that following F. mosseae inoculation, (1) nutrient deficiency caused by osmotic stress was mitigated by the fungus enhancing nutrient contents (K, Ca, and Mg) in roots and (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in leaves, with Ca and K contents being higher in both leaves and roots; (2) mycorrhizas alleviated ion toxicity by maintaining a favorable ion balance (e.g., K+/Na+), and this regulatory effect was higher in leaves than that in roots; and (3) oxidative damage was reduced by an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of antioxidant compounds in mycorrhizal plants although the increase differed in leaves and roots. In particular, AM fungus-enhanced catalase activity and reduced glutathione content only occurred in leaves, whereas an enhanced content of reduced ascorbic acid was only noted in roots. Growth, root vitality, leaf photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthetic rate, and dry weight were higher in seedlings with AM fungus inoculation.

Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. RESULTS: From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan's campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6  5 days. Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.

Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain. Refocusing policy priorities from disease control to prevention will improve international coordination efforts in pandemic prevention. Implementing such proactive actions will cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets.

This article aimed to explore risk factors related to RR/MDR-TBM, and compare therapeutic effects of linezolid (LZD)- and non-linezolid-containing regimen for RR/MDR-TB patients in Shenzhen city. Furthermore, we aimed to find a better therapy for pathogen-negative TBM with RR/MDR-TBM related risk factors. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study enrolling 137 hospitalized cases with confirmed TBM from June 2014 to March 2020. All patients were divided into RR/MDR-TBM group (12 cases) and NRR/MDR-TBM group (125 cases) based on GeneXpert MTB/RIF and (or) phenotypic drug susceptibility test results using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The risk factors related to RR/MDR-TBM were investigated through comparing clinical and examination features between the two groups. The mortality rate of RR/MDR-TBM patients treated with different regimens was analyzed to compare their respective therapeutic effects. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Most patients (111/137, 81%) were from southern or southwestern China, and a large proportion (72/137, 52.55%) belonged to migrant workers. 12 cases were RR/MDR-TBM (12/137, 8.8%) while 125 cases were NRR/MDR-TBM (125/137, 91.2%). The proportion of patients having prior TB treatment history in the RR/MDR-TBM group was significantly higher than that of the NRR/MDR-TBM group (6/12 vs. 12/125, 50% vs. 10.5%, P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed on other clinical and examination features between the two groups. Mortality was significantly lower in RR/MDR-TBM patients on linezolid-containing treatment regimen than those who were not (0/7 versus 3/5, 0% versus 60%, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS The main related risk factor of RR/MDR-TBM is the history of anti-tuberculosis treatment.

The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which may further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning models have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning models. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this issue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process. Moreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false predictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental results prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art methods.

RESULTS: In 2020, there were 73,254, 64,584, and 67,677 excess deaths in comparison to 2017-2019, respectively. For the Silesian voivodship, it was 8339, 7946, and 8701, respectively. The total mean increase in deaths was 16% for the whole country and the Silesian voivodship. The simulation for 30% extra COVID-19 deaths gave COVID-19 mortality equal to 12.5%; n = 50,708 deaths, for extra 60%; 17.9% n = 72,866 and for extra 70%; 19.7% n = 80,251 for Poland; and 11.9% (n = 6072), 17.2% (n = 8740), 24.2% (n = 12,297), respectively, for the Silesian voivodship. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of COVID-19 in total deaths should not exceed 20% for Poland and 24% for the Silesian voivodship in 2020.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Total Mortality in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) mainly cause enteric and/or respiratory signs.

Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, the recombination of an alpha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely.

While a number of studies have concentrated on smokers only, recent published data demonstrate that at least one fourth of patients with COPD are non-smokers, and that the burden of COPD in non-smokers is also higher than previously believed. Risk factors of COPD in non-smokers may include genetic factors, long-standing asthma, outdoor air pollution (from traffic and other sources), environmental smoke exposure (ETS), biomass smoke, occupational exposure, diet, recurrent respiratory infection in early childhood, tuberculosis and so on. In Asian region, indoor/outdoor air pollution and poor socioeconomic status may play important roles in the pathogenesis of non-smoking-related COPD. The prevalence of COPD among never smokers varies widely across nations. Such a variation may arise from several aspects, including study design, definition of COPD, diagnostic criteria, age and gender distribution of the studied population, local risk factors and socioeconomic status.

Dietary factors and nutritional status are among the exacerbating factors of acne. Phase angle (PhA), a direct measure of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), represents an indicator of the chronic inflammatory state. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a healthy dietary pattern that can exert anti-inflammatory effects in several inflammatory diseases. We aimed to investigate the difference in PhA and adherence to the MD and their associations with the severity of acne in a sample of na?ve treatment patients with acne compared to control group. MATERIALS: In this cross-sectional, caseCcontrol, observational study, we enrolled 51 patients with acne and 51 control individuals. Body composition was evaluated by a BIA phase-sensitive system (50 kHz BIA 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy, Akern). For adherence to the MD, we have used the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterrnea (PREDIMED) questionnaire. The clinical severity of acne was assessed by using the global acne grading system (GAGS), a quantitative scoring system to assess acne severity. RESULTS: Patients with acne had a worse body composition, in particular smaller PhA (p = 0.003), and a lower adherence to the MD (p < 0.001) than the control group, in spite of no differences in gender, age and BMI between the two groups. Stratifying patients with acne according to GAGS categories, both PhA (p = 0.006) and PREDIMED score (p = 0.007) decreased significantly in severe acne than mild/moderate acne. The GAGS score was negative correlations with PhA (r = ? 0.478, p < 0.001) and PREDIMED score (r = ? 0.504, p < 0.001). The results of the multivariate analysis showed PhA and PREDIMED score were the major determinants of GAGS score (p < 0.001). The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis reporting a value of PhA of  6.1 and a PREDIMED score of  9 identified patients with acne with the highest clinical severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Novel correlations were reported between PhA and the degree of adherence to the MD with acne severity. Of interest, PhA and PREDIMED scores might represent possible markers of the severity of acne in a clinical setting.

Knowledge of antibody seropositivity and its duration may help dictate post-pandemic planning. Methods: Using assays to detect antibodies to either nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins performed on specimens from 39,086 individuals with confirmed positive COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to January 2021, we analyzed nationwide seropositivity rates of IgG up to 300 days following patients' initial positive NAAT test. Linear regression identified trends in seropositivity rates and logistic regression tested positive predictability by age, sex, assay type and days post-infection. Findings: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 S and N-proteins followed a linear trend reaching approximately 90% positivity at 21 days post-index. The rate of N-protein seropositivity declined at a sharper rate, decaying to 682% [95% CI: 631-708%] after 293 days, while S-antibody seropositivity maintained a rate of 878% [95% CI: 863-891%] through 300 days. In addition to antigen type and the number of days post-positive PCR, age and gender were also significant factors in seropositivity prediction, with those under 65 years of age showing a more sustained seropositivity rate. Interpretation: Observational data from a national clinical laboratory, though limited by an epidemiological view of the U.S. population, offer an encouraging timeline for the development and sustainability of antibodies up to ten months from natural infection and could inform post-pandemic planning.","output":"A population-based analysis of the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This was a cross-sectional study to assess the psychological response to quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic and knowledge level about the disease among inmates of a Custodial Center in Enugu, Nigeria.

METHODS: Internal medicine residents scheduled to start a rotation on the primary HOS of an academic medical center were eligible for this parallel, unblinded, randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation. Participants underwent block randomization to the usual educational curriculum either with or without access to a series of novel screencasts; all participants received an anonymous online end-of-rotation survey and a $20 gift certificate upon completion. The primary outcome was the change in attitude among learners, measured as their self-reported confidence for managing the clinical topics. RESULTS: From 12/9/2019 through 6/15/2020, accrual was completed with 67 of 78 eligible residents (86%) enrolled and randomized. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and participant response rate was 91%.

We conducted a longitudinal, clinical observational study of 10 patients with RDEB who used a mobile phone photography application, with built-in machine learning, to outline and track RDEB wounds autonomously. Patients used this mobile application to capture photographs weekly, alongside reporting associated pain and itch. 507 photos of 10 participants with RDEB were collected: 202 of chronic open wounds (unhealed >12 weeks) and 290 of recurrent wounds (heal but re-open), with an average of 44.7 wound photos per participant. The top three locations recorded were hips or legs (n=241), feet (n=115) and upper extremity (n=82). For chronic open wounds, there was a statistically significant positive correlation for both wound size and pain (0.76, p<0.001), and wound size and itch (0.74, p<0.001).

A total of 71,808 confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified and followed up for their vital status through April 25, 2020. Exposures to ambient air pollution and temperature were estimated by linking the city- and county-level monitoring data to the residential community of each participant. For each participant, two windows were defined: the period from symptom onset to diagnosis (Exposure Window a ), and the period from the diagnosis date to date of death/recovery or end of the study period (Exposure Window a ?). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between these environmental factors and COVID-19 case fatality. COVID-19 case fatality increased in association with environmental factors for two exposure windows. For example, each 10 ug/m3 increase of PM2.5, PM10, O3 and NO2 in Window I was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.13), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.13), 1.09 (95 CI: 1.03, 1.14) and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.35) for COVID-19 fatality, respectively. A significant effect was also observed for low temperature, with a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) for COVID-19 case fatality per each 1C decrease. Subgroup analysis indicated that these effects were stronger in the elderly, as well as those with mild symptoms and living in Wuhan or Hubei. Overall, the sensitivity analyses also yielded the consistent estimates. Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and low temperature during the illness would play a nonnegligible part in causing case fatality of COVID-19.

As we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not sufficiently leverage the rich toolset that risk management offers to prepare for and mitigate the resulting uncertainty. This article highlights four aspects of risk management, and their practical and theorical implications. They are: 1) Risk (in the narrower sense), where possible future outcomes can be captured through probability distributions. 2) A situation of uncertainty, where there is transparency regarding what is not known, but probability distributions are unknown, as well as causal relationships influencing the outcome in question. 3) A situation of ignorance, where there is no understanding that certain possible future developments are even relevant. And finally: 4) The emergence of organizational and inter-organizational myopia as an effect of risk, uncertainty and ignorance on collective human behaviour.","output":"Risk, uncertainty, ignorance and myopia: Their managerial implications for B2B firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food systems, including production, acquisition, preparation, and consumption, feature importantly in environmental sustainability, energy consumption and climate change. With predicted increases in food and water shortages associated with climate change, food-related lifestyle and behavioral changes are advocated as important mitigation and adaptation measures. Yet, reducing emissions from food systems is predicted to be one of our greatest challenges now and in the future. Traditional theories of environmental behavioral change often assume that individuals make reasoned choices that incorporate costCbenefit assessment, moral and normative concerns and affect/symbolic motives, yielding behavioral interventions that are often designed as informational or structural strategies. In contrast, some researchers recommend moving toward an approach that systematically examines the temporal organization of society with an eye toward understanding the patterns of social practices to better understand behaviors and develop more targeted and effective interventions. Our study follows on these recommendations with a study of food consumption lifestyles in the United States, using extant time use diary data from a nationally representative sample of Americans (n = 16,100) from 2014 to 2016. We use cluster analysis to identify unique groups based on temporal and locational eating patterns. We find evidence of six respondent clusters with distinct patterns of food consumption based on timing and location of eating, as well as individual and household characteristics. Factors associated with cluster membership include age, employment status, and marital status. We note the close connections between age and behaviors, suggesting that a life course scholarship approach may add valuable insight. Based on our findings, we identify opportunities for promoting sustainable energy use in the context of the transition to renewables, such as targeting energy-shifting and efficiency-improvement interventions based on group membership.","output":"Food Practice Lifestyles: Identification and Implications for Energy Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perceived changes in diet quality, emotional eating, physical activity, and lifestyle were evaluated in a group of Mexican adults before and during COVID-19 confinement. In this study, 8289 adults answered an online questionnaire between April and May 2020. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported weight and height, diet quality, emotional eating, physical activity, and lifestyle changes were collected. Before and after confinement, differences by sociodemographic characteristics were assessed with Wilcoxon, Anova, and linear regression analyses. Most participants were women (80%) between 18 and 38 years old (70%), with a low degree of marginalisation (82.8%) and a high educational level (84.2%); 53.1% had a normal weight and 31.4% were overweight. Half (46.8%) of the participants perceived a change in the quality of their diet. The Diet Quality Index (DQI) was higher during confinement (it improved by 3 points) in all groups, regardless of education level, marginalisation level, or place of residence (p < 0.001).

Based on the thesis that the respective social developments equally influence and limit the orientation and design of workplace health promotion, this article deals with the challenges that arise from the contemporary social, political and economic developments for a needs-oriented and effective workplace health promotion. On the basis of a historical review of the lines of development in workplace health promotion, beginning with the Ottawa Charter in 1986, the field of tension in which work-related health promotion approaches generally operate is first outlined. Based on the results of a keyword search in relevant European statistics databases and specialized databases on the topics of demographic change, labor migration and digitalization and flexibilization of work, current development trends in the world of work are traced, priority desiderata for a future design of health promotion are derived from these, and their chances of realization are reflected upon. On the basis of the data collected, it becomes clear that todays world of work is characterized by multidimensional diversification processes, which are accompanied by the risk of worsening social inequalities. The conclusion is that future concepts of workplace health promotion must be more universal than previous approaches, which are often limited to the focus of individual behavioral prevention. The attempt to promote workplace health promotion with economic benefit arguments also runs the risk of reinforcing social inequality. The task of effective workplace health promotion, conversely, must be to initiate critical reflection on current priorities.","output":"Future Challenges for Work-Related Health Promotion in Europe: A Data-Based Theoretical Reflection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently experience a coagulopathy associated with a high incidence of thrombotic events leading to poor outcomes.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to classify COVID-19 and normal patients from CXR images using semantic segmentation networks for detecting and labeling COVID-19 infected lung lobes in CXR images. METHODS For semantically segmenting infected lung lobes in CXR images for COVID-19 early detection, three structurally different deep learning (DL) networks such as SegNet, U-Net and hybrid CNN with SegNet plus U-Net, are proposed and investigated. Further, the optimized CXR image semantic segmentation networks such as GWO SegNet, GWO U-Net, and GWO hybrid CNN are developed with the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The proposed DL networks are trained, tested, and validated without and with optimization on the openly available dataset that contains 2,572 COVID-19 CXR images including 2,174 training images and 398 testing images. The DL networks and their GWO optimized networks are also compared with other state-of-the-art models used to detect COVID-19 CXR images. RESULTS All optimized CXR image semantic segmentation networks for COVID-19 image detection developed in this study achieved detection accuracy higher than 92%. The result shows the superiority of optimized SegNet in segmenting COVID-19 infected lung lobes and classifying with an accuracy of 98.08% compared to optimized U-Net and hybrid CNN.

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a burden on health systems worldwide and especially on healthcare workers at the first line delivering their services in remote areas of Greece. This study investigates preparedness and awareness level of primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) and their risk perception in managing the pandemic during its initial phase. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in public PHC units in Greece. A web-based 14-item questionnaire, tested in a pilot study, was administered by a pre-existing panel of the Education and Research Network in PHC of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. Associations were assessed between epidemic response awareness, risk perception, participant demographics and work settings. Participants were grouped by profession in first-line physicians (general practitioners, internal medicine specialists, pediatricians), first-line non-physicians (nurses, health visitors, paramedics) and second-line PHCWs (dentists, microbiologists, administrators, midwifes, laboratory technicians, nutritionists and social workers). Univariate logistic regression and multivariable analysis were performed and linear regression was performed to examine the effect of participants' awareness of the preparedness plan to their working area characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 441 PHCWs participated in the survey. Risks were perceived at a lower level by second-line PHCWs than by first-line PHCWs (B=-0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.49- -0.08; p=0.028). Older PHCWs had less concerns than younger PHCWs (B=-0.04, 95%CI -0.08- -0.01; p=0.025) and more experienced participants had more concerns than less experienced (B=0.04, 95%CI 0.00,0.07; p=0.050). PHCWs in rural settings presented with more preparedness awareness, compared to PHCWs in urban areas (B=1.10, 95%CI 0.28,1.92; p=0.008), while PHCWs living with high risk individuals showed less situation awareness (-0.55, 95%CI -0.95-0.16; p=0.006). CONCLUSION: PHCWs in rural areas revealed a relatively high awareness of the response measures and management protocol requirements that were in place, compared to their colleagues in urban areas. As expected, first-line PHCWs directly exposed to emergencies expressed more concerns than second-line PHCWs. Learning from the challenges occurring during the initial phase of the pandemic could help PHC facilities address COVID-19 effectively and PHCWs' sense of security and confidence could be augmented, even when working in remote areas of the country. When planning training, distributing equipment and proposing protocols, the characteristics of the area and the needs of PHCWs, and population should be cautiously considered.","output":"Perceived risk and pandemic response awareness in low-capacity public primary health care in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep neural network architectures are considered to be robust to random perturbations.

The communicable diseases of the respiratory tract are probably the most common cause of symptomatic human infections. The viruses that are causative agents for human respiratory disease comprise the five taxonomically distinct families: orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviridae, and adenoviridae. The influenza viruses, which consist of types A, B, and C, belong to the family orthomyxoviridae. Types A and B have been associated with significant increases in mortality during epidemics. The disease may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. Immunization against influenza has been recommended for high-risk groups and antiviral chemotherapy (amantadine) is available for the treatment and prophylaxis of all influenza A infections. There is both a great need for and interest in developing a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of these two viral, respiratory tract pathogens. The family picornaviridae contains the genus Rhinovirus that is composed of over a hundred distinct serotypes. Amantadine and rimantadine are specifically active against influenza A virus infections. The amantadine recipients reported a higher incidence of side effects largely attributed to the central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. This difference in side effects may be a pharmacokinetic phenomenon that results in higher plasma concentrations of amantadine. Significant progress continues to be made in the clinical use and development of agents active against DNA viruses. Acyclovir (9-(2-h droxyethoxymethyl)guanine) has been the subject of several reviews and of a syrnposium. Considerable progress has been made in evaluating the clinical promise of acyclovir; however, there remains much to be learned concerning the best use of this drug in clinical practice. Significant strides have been made in the development of clinically useful antiviral agents, especially against the DNA viruses of the herpes family. Most of these agents are directed against viral nucleic acid synthesis and require activation by a virus-induced thymidine kinase. Researchers have begun to focus on other strategies that may produce broader spectrum anti-viral agents with different mechanisms of action.","output":"Chapter 12.

METHODS Data were collected from presentations to four EDs in Queensland from 2009 to 2014. A modified version of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) method for identifying GP-type ED presentations was used. RESULTS The four EDs have different proportions of GP-type presentations, between 7% and 33%. Between 2009 and 2014, the amount of GP-type presentations increased in three EDs, by between 5% and 16%, and decreased by 30% in the other ED. Different holidays, for example, the public holidays over the Christmas to New Year period, impact GP-type presentations. Over 50% of GP-type presentations occurred in those aged 0-34 years, and <1% were aged 85+ years. Injury-related diagnoses made up around 37% of the GP-type presentations, and around 13% did not wait for a diagnosis, averaged over the EDs. GP-type presentations are more likely to present to EDs outside standard general practitioner hours. CONCLUSIONS Existing methods for identifying GP-type presentations have drawbacks, and modified methods are required to better identify these types of presentations. Temporal effects not previously investigated in Australian studies, such as holidays, are significantly associated with GP-type presentations. These findings aid strategic planning and interventions to support review of GP-type presentations, instead, in primary-care facilities, and such interventions may be assistive in some EDs more than others.","output":"Identifying and quantifying general practice-type emergency department presentations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an overview of some of the most memorable sessions that were (co)organised by the Allied Respiratory Professionals Assembly during the 2021 European Respiratory Society International Congress, which was held online for the second consecutive year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, until now stimulation has generally been supramaximal and non-selective, resulting in a range of side effects. Selective VNS (sVNS) aims to mitigate this by targeting specific fiber types within the nerve to produce functionally specific effects. In recent years, several key paradigms of sVNS have been developedspatially selective, fiber-selective, anodal block, neural titration, and kilohertz electrical stimulation blockas well as various stimulation pulse parameters and electrode array geometries. sVNS can significantly reduce the severity of side effects, and in some cases increase efficacy of the treatment. While most studies have focused on fiber-selective sVNS, spatially selective sVNS has demonstrated comparable mitigation of side-effects. It has the potential to achieve greater specificity and provide crucial information about vagal nerve physiology. Anodal block achieves strong side-effect mitigation too, but is much less specific than fiber- and spatially selective paradigms. The major hurdle to achieving better selectivity of VNS is a limited knowledge of functional anatomical organization of vagus nerve.

METHODS: This is a multicenter observational clinical study with no intervention conducted from Jan 25th to March 1st, 2020. Clinical data and samples of tears and conjunctival scraping were collected in consecutive laboratory-confirmed, non-severe COVID-19 patients from three hospitals. COVID-19 virus was analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: Totally 255 laboratory-confirmed, non-severe COVID-19 patients were recruited for ocular manifestation investigation. Of them, 54.9% were females, with a mean age of 49.4y. None of the patients has evidence of uveitis;11 patients (4.3%) complained of mild asthenopia;2 (0.8%) had mild conjunctival congestion and serous secretion. Twenty-five of them had performed tears and conjunctival scrape for COVID-19 virus detection, with 4 yield possible positive results in the nucleoprotein gene. One of them were asymptomatic with normal chest CT and positive pharyngeal swab result. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations are neither common nor specific in non-severe COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, COVID-19 virus nucleotides can be detected in the tears and conjunctival scrape samples, warranting further research on the transmissibility by the ocular route. ? 2021 International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who underwent psychiatric consultations. The medical records of 892 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the 89 among them who requested psychiatric consultations were analyzed retrospectively. After the psychiatric consultations, patients were most frequently diagnosed with delirium (38.2%), adjustment disorder (27.0%), depressive disorder (19.1%) and anxiety disorder (11.2%). Patients with delirium had longer hospital stays (p < .001), were transferred more frequently to intensive care units (p < .001), and had higher mortality rates during their hospital stays (p < .001), than all other patients. The need for oxygen (p < .001) and mechanical ventilation (p < .001) was also significantly higher in delirium patients, as well as in patients who received other psychiatric diagnoses. Neuropsychiatric disorders develop in patients receiving inpatient treatments in COVID-19 wards, and these disorders negatively affect the prognosis of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders in in-patients with COVID-19 might be associated with the negative outcomes of the disease.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Inpatients Who Underwent Psychiatric Consultations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research found that patients with cancer and COVID-19 are susceptible to long-term infection, particularly if they have hematologic cancers or metastatic disease.

METHODS: Serum lactate and clearance were measured before MCS and at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-MCS in 43 patients at four tertiary-care centers in Southern Brazil. Prognostic value was assessed by univariable and multivariable analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for 30-day mortality. RESULTS: VA-ECMO was the most common MCS modality (58%). Serum lactate levels at all time points and lactate clearance after 6 h were associated with mortality on unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Lactate levels were higher in non-survivors at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after MCS. Serum lactate > 1.55 mmol/L at 24 h was the best single prognostic marker of 30-day mortality [area under the ROC curve = 0.81 (0.67C0.94); positive predictive value = 86%). Failure to improve serum lactate after 24 h was associated with 100% mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Serum lactate was an important prognostic biomarker in cardiogenic shock treated with temporary MCS.

METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital \\"12 de Octubre,\\" Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: Three patients (2 men and 1 woman, aged 63-88 years) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called inflammatory phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All of them had presented previously with anosmia. Myoclonus was generalized with both positive and negative jerks, predominantly involving the facial, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and upper extremities muscles. These myoclonic jerks occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movements, with an exaggerated startle response. Other causes of myoclonus were ruled out, and none of the patients had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia. All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a post- or para-infectious immune-mediated disorder.

Participants will have been hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19, and will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive lopinavir /ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, both or neither drug in addition to standard of care management. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will be recruited from >80 hospitals across Australia and New Zealand, representing metropolitan and regional centres in both public and private sectors. Admitted patients will be eligible if aged &#8805; 18 years, have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing in the past 12 days and are expected to remain an inpatient for at least 48 hours from the time of randomisation. Potentially eligible participants will be excluded if admitted to intensive care or requiring high level respiratory support, are currently receiving study drugs or their use is contraindicated due to allergy, drug interaction or comorbidities (including baseline QTc prolongation of 470ms for women or 480ms for men), or death is anticipated imminently. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to: Group 1: standard of care; Group 2: lopinavir (400mg) / ritonavir (100mg) twice daily for 10 days in tablet form; Group 3: hydroxychloroquine (800mg) 4x200mg administered 12 hours apart on Day 1, followed by 400mg twice a day for 6 days; Group 4: lopinavir /ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES: Proportion of participants alive and not having required intensive respiratory support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation) at 15 days after enrolment. A range of clinical and virological secondary outcomes will also be evaluated. RANDOMISATION: The randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent statistician. Randomisation will be stratified by site and will be in permuted blocks of variable block size. The randomised sequence allocation will only be accessible to the data management group, and site investigators will have individual participant allocation provided through a web-based trial enrolment platform. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study, with researchers assessing the laboratory outcomes blinded to treatment allocation. No unblinding procedures relating to potential adverse effects are therefore required.

The CHCF, however, has faced numerous expirations and short\\\\term extensions since 2015, which could pose challenges to long\\\\term planning, especially for FQHCs that rely more on federal funds. To examine the potential implications of changes or lapses in federal funding, we identified FQHCs that likely receive a larger share of revenue from federal funds and compared their local area traits with other FQHCs. STUDY DESIGN: We used publicly available data for 2010C2018 from the Uniform Data System, which contains information on FQHC traits, patient volume, and non\\\\patient revenue. Because total and patient revenue were unavailable, we classified FQHCs as receiving a high share of total revenue from Section 330 funding if >75% of their non\\\\patient revenue was from Section 330 funding and > 25% of their patients were uninsured (as a proxy for patient revenue). We assessed the association between annual changes in Section 330 funding and FQHC patient volume for FQHCs meeting this classification vs. not, using multivariate linear regression with FQHC\\\\level random effects. We then compared FQHCs with vs. without a high share of revenue from Section 330 funding in 2018 using multivariate logistic regression. Lastly, we compared county\\\\level COVID\\\\19 mortality data for these FQHCs. POPULATION STUDIED: FQHCs, excluding those in US territories, that received Section 330 funding 2010C2018 (N = 1258 in 2018). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although the mean proportion of uninsured FQHC patients decreased from 38.2% to 23.9% from 2010C2018, more FQHCs were classified as having a high Section 330 revenue share: 7.9% in 2010 (N = 80) versus 16.2% in 2018 (N = 203). The positive association between annual changes in Section 330 funding and patient volume was greater for FQHCs classified as having high Section 330 revenue share vs. not (+0.05 percentage point greater increase in patient volume [95% CI: 0.03C0.07] for a 1\\\\ppt increase in funding). In 2018, compared to other FQHCs, those with a high Section 330 revenue share were smaller, more often located in the South (68.5% vs. 27.7%; aOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.27C6.81 vs. Northeast) and primary care shortage areas (57.6% vs. 30.1%; aOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.23C3.00), and less likely in Medicaid expansion states (35.5% vs. 77.7%, aOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21C0.52). In bivariate analyses, FQHCs with high Section 330 revenue share were located in counties with higher mean COVID\\\\19 mortality rates (e.g., 102.2 vs. 84.8 deaths/100,000 for MayCDecember 2020, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patient volume was more responsive to changes in Section 330 funding for FQHCs with high proportions of uninsured patients and non\\\\patient revenue from Section 330 funds. FQHCs that could be more vulnerable to lapses in federal funding are more frequently located in the South, primary care shortage areas, states without Medicaid expansion, and counties with higher COVID\\\\19 mortality rates.

Previously, augmentation of epidural analgesia with intraperitoneal local anesthetic was shown to improve functional postoperative recovery following colectomy. OBJECTIVE This study determines whether intraperitoneal local anesthetic improves postoperative recovery in patients undergoing colectomy, in the absence of epidural analgesia, with standardized enhanced recovery after surgery perioperative care. DESIGN This is a multisite, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02449720). SETTINGS This study was conducted at 3 hospital sites in South Australia. PATIENTS Eighty-six adults undergoing colectomy were stratified by approach (35 open; 51 laparoscopic), then randomly assigned to intraperitoneal local anesthetic (n = 44) and control (n = 42) groups. INTERVENTIONS Patients in the intraperitoneal local anesthetic group received an intraoperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine 100-mg bolus both pre- and postdissection and 20 mg/h continuous postoperative infusion for 48 hours. Patients in the control group received a normal saline equivalent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Functional postoperative recovery was assessed by using the surgical recovery scale for 45 days; postoperative pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale; and opioid consumption, use of rescue ketamine, recovery of bowel function, time to readiness for discharge, and perioperative complications were recorded. RESULTS The intraperitoneal local anesthetic group reported improved surgical recovery scale scores at day 1 and 7, lower pain scores, required less rescue ketamine, and passed flatus earlier than the control group (p < 0.05). The improvement in surgical recovery scale at day 7 and pain scores remained when laparoscopic colectomy was considered separately. Opioid consumption and time to readiness for discharge were equivalent. LIMITATIONS This study was powered to detect a difference in surgical recovery scale, but not the other domains of recovery, when the intraperitoneal local anesthetic group was compared with control. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that instillation and infusion of intraperitoneal ropivacaine for patients undergoing colectomy, including by the laparoscopic approach, decreases postoperative pain and improves functional postoperative recovery. We recommend routine inclusion of intraperitoneal local anesthetic into the multimodal analgesia component of enhanced recovery after surgery programs for laparoscopic colectomy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the associations of coronavirus disease 2019 with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy and to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a matched case-control study of pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases who delivered between 16 and 41 weeks' gestation from March 11 to June 11, 2020. Uninfected pregnant women (controls) were matched to coronavirus disease 2019 cases on a 2:1 ratio based on delivery date. Maternal demographic characteristics, coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, laboratory evaluations, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, and clinical management were chart abstracted. The primary outcomes included (1) a composite of adverse maternal outcome, defined as preeclampsia, venous thromboembolism, antepartum admission, maternal intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or maternal death, and (2) a composite of adverse neonatal outcome, defined as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, 5-minute Apgar score of <5, persistent category 2 fetal heart rate tracing despite intrauterine resuscitation, or neonatal death. To quantify the associations between exposure to mild and severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression (to account for matching), with matched-pair odds ratio and 95% confidence interval based on 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap resampling as the effect measure. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 61 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases were enrolled during the study period (mild disease, n=54 [88.5%]; severe disease, n=6 [9.8%]; critical disease, n=1 [1.6%]). The odds of adverse composite maternal outcome were 3.4 times higher among cases than controls (18.0% vs 8.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-13.4). The odds of adverse composite neonatal outcome were 1.7 times higher in the case group than to the control group (18.0% vs 13.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-4.8).

In addition, we find the real exchange rate and net export to GDP ratio have a statistically significant impact on sovereign bond risk premium.","output":"Assessing the Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) Sovereign Bond Risk Premium and Fiscal Solvency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 are respiratory diseases that disproportionately occur among medically underserved populations; little is known about their epidemiologic intersection. OBJECTIVE: To characterize persons diagnosed with TB and COVID-19 in California. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis of population-based public health surveillance data assessed the sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of California residents who were diagnosed with TB (including cases diagnosed and reported between September 3, 2019, and December 31, 2020) and COVID-19 (including confirmed cases based on positive results on polymerase chain reaction tests and probable cases based on positive results on antigen assays reported through February 2, 2021) in close succession compared with those who were diagnosed with TB before the COVID-19 pandemic (between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019) or diagnosed with COVID-19 alone (through February 2, 2021). This analysis included 3 402 713 California residents with COVID-19 alone, 6280 with TB before the pandemic, and 91 with confirmed or probable COVID-19 diagnosed within 120 days of a TB diagnosis (ie, TB/COVID-19). EXPOSURES: Sociodemographic characteristics, medical risk factors, factors associated with TB severity, and health equity index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of reported successive TB and COVID-19 (TB/COVID-19) diagnoses within 120 days, frequency of deaths, and age-adjusted mortality rates. RESULTS: Among the 91 persons with TB/COVID-19, the median age was 58.0 years (range, 3.0-95.0 years; IQR, 41.0-73.0 years); 52 persons (57.1%) were male; 81 (89.0%) were born outside the US; and 28 (30.8%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 4 (4.4%) were Black, 55 (60.4%) were Hispanic or Latino, 4 (4.4%) were White. The frequency of reported COVID-19 among those who received a TB diagnosis between September 3, 2019, and December 31, 2020, was 225 of 2210 persons (10.2%), which was similar to that of the general population (3 402 804 of 39 538 223 persons [8.6%]). Compared with persons with TB before the pandemic, those with TB/COVID-19 were more likely to be Hispanic or Latino (2285 of 6279 persons [36.4%; 95% CI, 35.2%-37.6%] vs 55 of 91 persons [60.4%; 95% CI, 49.6%-70.5%], respectively; P < .001), reside in low health equity census tracts (1984 of 6027 persons [32.9%; 95% CI, 31.7%-34.1%] vs 40 of 89 persons [44.9%; 95% CI, 34.4%-55.9%]; P = .003), live in the US longer before receiving a TB diagnosis (median, 19.7 years [IQR, 7.2-32.3 years] vs 23.1 years [IQR, 15.2-31.5 years]; P = .03), and have diabetes (1734 of 6280 persons [27.6%; 95% CI, 26.5%-28.7%] vs 42 of 91 persons [46.2%; 95% CI, 35.6%-56.9%]; P < .001). The frequency of deaths among those with TB/COVID-19 successively diagnosed within 30 days (8 of 34 persons [23.5%; 95% CI, 10.8%-41.2%]) was more than twice that of persons with TB before the pandemic (631 of 5545 persons [11.4%; 95% CI, 10.6%-12.2%]; P = .05) and 20 times that of persons with COVID-19 alone (42 171 of 3 402 713 persons [1.2%; 95% CI, 1.2%-1.3%]; P < .001). Persons with TB/COVID-19 who died were older (median, 81.0 years; IQR, 75.0-85.0 years) than those who survived (median, 54.0 years; IQR, 37.5-68.5 years; P < .001). The age-adjusted mortality rate remained higher among persons with TB/COVID-19 (74.2 deaths per 1000 persons; 95% CI, 26.2-122.1 deaths per 1000 persons) compared with either disease alone (TB before the pandemic: 56.3 deaths per 1000 persons [95% CI, 51.2-61.4 deaths per 1000 persons]; COVID-19 only: 17.1 deaths per 1000 persons [95% CI, 16.9-17.2 deaths per 1000 persons]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional analysis, TB/COVID-19 was disproportionately diagnosed among California residents who were Hispanic or Latino, had diabetes, or were living in low health equity census tracts. These results suggest that tuberculosis and COVID-19 occurring together may be associated with increases in mortality compared with either disease alone, especially among older adults. Addressing health inequities and integrating prevention efforts could avert the occurrence of concurrent COVID-19 and TB and potentially reduce deaths.","output":"Sociodemographic Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Mortality Among Persons Diagnosed With Tuberculosis and COVID-19 in Close Succession in California, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discovery of durable memory B cell (MBC) subsets against neutralizing viral epitopes is critical for determining immune correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we identified functionally distinct SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cell subsets by profiling the repertoire of convalescent COVID-19 patients using a high-throughput B cell sorting and sequencing platform. Utilizing barcoded SARS-CoV-2 antigen baits, we isolated thousands of B cells that segregated into discrete functional subsets specific for the spike, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and open reading frame (ORF) proteins 7a and 8. Spike-specific B cells were enriched in canonical MBC clusters, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from these cells were potently neutralizing. By contrast, B cells specific to ORF8 and NP were enriched in na?ve and innate-like clusters, and mAbs against these targets were exclusively non-neutralizing. Finally, we identified that B cell specificity, subset distribution, and affinity maturation were impacted by clinical features such as age, sex, and symptom duration. Together, our data provide a comprehensive tool for evaluating B cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and highlight the complexity of the human B cell response to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Distinct B cell subsets give rise to antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During pandemics, such as the one caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, simple methods to rapidly test large numbers of people are needed.

Using sequence data from other coronaviruses, preexisting to SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that not only capture amino acid conservation but also more complex patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that these models are notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, we observe that the predicted mutability correlates well with experimental measures of protein stability and that both are reliable mutability predictors (receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve 0.8). Most interestingly, we observe an increasing agreement between our model and the observed variability as more data become available over time, proving the anticipatory capacity of our model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the ED of the largest tertiary medical center in Taiwan. Trends of adult, non-trauma patients who visited the ED during FebruaryCApril 2019 were compared with those during FebruaryCApril 2020. The number of visits, their dispositions, crowding parameters, and turnover rates were analyzed. The primary outcome was the change in ED attendance between the two periods. The secondary outcomes were changes in hospital admission rates, crowding parameters, and turnover rates. RESULTS: During the outbreak, there were decreased non-trauma ED visits by 33.45% (p < 0.001) and proportion of Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale (TTAS) 3 patients (p=0.02), with increased admission rates by 4.7% (p < 0.001).

The availability of hand sanitizing products for use when water and soap are unavailable has increased in recent years. The aim of this systematic review was to collate scientific information on the efficacy of hand sanitizers compared with washing hands with soap and water for the removal of foodborne pathogens from the hands of food handlers. An extensive literature search was carried out using three electronic databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Twenty-eight scientific publications were ultimately included in the review. Analysis of this literature revealed various limitations in the scientific information owing to the absence of a standardized protocol for evaluating the efficacy of hand products and variation in experimental conditions. However, despite conflicting results, scientific evidence seems to support the historical skepticism about the use of waterless hand sanitizers in food preparation settings. Water and soap appear to be more effective than waterless products for removal of soil and microorganisms from hands. Alcohol-based products achieve rapid and effective inactivation of various bacteria, but their efficacy is generally lower against nonenveloped viruses.

Therefore, the search for compounds of natural origin with antiviral activity is an important area of research. In the present study, three compounds were isolated and identified from seeds of Tabernaemontana cymosa plants. The in vitro antiviral effect of those compounds and voacangine against different DENV strains was assessed using different experimental approaches: compounds added before the infection (Pre), at the same time with the virus (Trans), after the infection (Post) or compounds present in all moments of the experiment (Pre-Trans-Post, Combined treatment). In silico studies (docking and molecular dynamics) were also performed to explain the possible antiviral mechanisms. The identified compounds were three structural analogs of voacangine (voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine, rupicoline and 3-oxo-voacangine). In the Pre-treatment, only voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection caused by the DENV-2/NG strain (16.4% and 29.6% infection, respectively). In the Trans-treatment approach, voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection in both DENV-2/NG (11.2%, 80.4% and 75.7% infection, respectively) and DENV-2/16681 infection models (73.7%, 74.0% and 75.3% infection, respectively). The latter strain was also inhibited by 3-oxo-voacangine (82.8% infection). Moreover, voacangine (most effective virucidal agent) was also effective against one strain of DENV-1 (DENV-1/WestPac/74) and against the third strain of DENV-2 (DENV-2/S16803) (48.5% and 32.4% infection, respectively). Conversely, no inhibition was observed in the post-treatment approach. The last approach (combined) showed that voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited over 90% of infections (3.5%, 6.9% and 3.5% infection, respectively) of both strains (DENV-2/NG and DENV-2/16681). The free energy of binding obtained with an in silico approach was favorable for the E protein and compounds, which ranged between ?5.1 and ?6.3 kcal/mol.

In this study, we examine disparate access to grocery stores in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. We utilized high-resolution location-based datasets in implementing spatial network analysis and dynamic clustering techniques to uncover the overall disparate access to grocery stores for socially vulnerable populations during different phases of the disaster. Three access indicators are examined using network-centric measures: number of unique stores visited, average trip time to stores, and average distance to stores. These access indicators help us capture three dimensions of access: redundancy, rapidity, and proximity. The findings show the insufficiency of focusing merely on the distributional factors, such as location in a food desert and number of facilities, to capture the disparities in access, especially during the preparation and impact/short-term recovery periods. Furthermore, the characterization of access by considering combinations of access indicators reveals that flooding disproportionally affects socially vulnerable populations. High-income areas have better access during preparation as they are able to visit a greater number of stores and commute farther distances to obtain supplies.

EVs have been identified as potential biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in other pulmonary diseases. We sought to characterize the EV phenotype within bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with ARDS, and to determine whether BAL EV could be used as a potential biomarker in ARDS. BAL was collected from patients with sepsis with and without ARDS, and from esophagectomy patients postoperatively (of whom a subset later developed ARDS during hospital admission). BAL EVs were characterized with regard to size, number, and cell of origin. Patients with sepsis-related ARDS had significantly higher numbers of CD14(+)/CD81(+) monocyte-derived BAL EV than patients with sepsis without ARDS (P = 0.015). However, the converse was observed in esophagectomy patients who later developed ARDS (P = 0.003). Esophagectomy patients who developed ARDS also had elevated CD31(+)/CD63(+) and CD31(+)/CD81(+) endothelial-derived BAL EV (P  0.02) compared with esophagectomy patients who did not develop ARDS. Further studies are required to determine whether CD31(+) BAL EV may be a predictive biomarker for ARDS in esophagectomy patients. CD14(+)/CD81(+) BAL EV numbers were significantly higher in those patients with sepsis-related ARDS who died during the 30 days following intensive care unit admission (P = 0.027). Thus, CD14(+)/CD81(+) BAL EVs are a potential biomarker for disease severity and mortality in sepsis-related ARDS.

Among the endothelial cells that make up the lining of tumor vasculature, a majority of them are tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs), exhibiting cytogenetic abnormalities of aneuploid chromosomes. Aneuploid TECs are generated from \\"cancerization of stromal endothelial cells\\" and \\"endothelialization of carcinoma cells\\" in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Both processes crucially engage the hypoxia-triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Compared to the cancerization process, endothelialization of cancer cells, which comprises the fusion of tumor cells with endothelial cells and transdifferentiation of cancer cells into TECs, is the dominant pathway. Tumor-derived endothelial cells, possessing the dual properties of cancerous malignancy and endothelial vascularization ability, are thus the endothelialized cancer cells. Circulating tumor-derived endothelial cells (CTECs) are TECs shed into the peripheral circulation. Aneuploid CD31+ CTECs, together with their counterpart CD31- circulating tumor cells (CTCs), constitute a unique pair of cellular circulating tumor biomarkers. This review discusses a proposed cascaded framework that focuses on the origins of TECs and CTECs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and their clinical implications for tumorigenesis, neovascularization, disease progression, and cancer metastasis. Aneuploid CTECs, harboring hybridized properties of malignancy, vascularization and motility, may serve as a unique target for developing a novel metastasis blockade cancer therapy.","output":"Aneuploid Circulating Tumor-Derived Endothelial Cell (CTEC): A Novel Versatile Player in Tumor Neovascularization and Cancer Metastasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) of nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) have become standard for diagnosis of SARS-COV2. IDSA guidelines suggest repeat testing after 24C48 h when initially negative and clinical suspicion persists. We characterized patients from whom initial NPS were NAAT-negative, but repeats were NAAT-positive, in order to identify which patients might benefit from repeat NAAT for SARS-CoV-2, and the appropriate interval. METHODS: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of laboratory and electronic medical record data for all patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mount Sinai Health System, whose initial NAATs were done between March 16 C March 30, 2020, and who were retested within one month. NAATs were performed on NPS in viral transport medium using the Roche Diagnostics cobas? 6800 SARS-CoV-2 Test. Baseline patient characteristics, clinical and radiographic findings were identified. RESULTS: Of 235 patients eligible for inclusion, 172 (70.5%) were initially NAAT-negative, and 118 (68.6%) remained NAAT-negative over 1 month follow up. 54 (31.4%) converted to NAAT-positive over the next 1-month. Of patients who became NAAT-positive, 31 (57.4%) were inpatients who converted results within a single admission; the average interval was 6d 7h between the NAAT-negative and NAAT-positive results, and the minimum interval was 10.5 h. Symptoms examined for correlation for conversion to NAAT-positive were: fever, cough, shortness of breath, and combined nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Duration of symptoms reported at triage did not appear to affect time to conversion to NAAT-positive. No individual symptom was more likely to be associated with conversion to NAAT- positive. However, time to conversion to NAAT-positive was shorter for patients with multiple symptoms. In general, chest radiography (CXR) findings correlated with NAAT results; interval to NAAT-positive was shorter for patients with worsening CXR findings. CONCLUSION: Our data supports repeat testing in patients with multiple clinical symptoms suggestive of SARS CoV-2 infection and negative initial NP test results. Further studies are needed to determine the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 NAAT assays. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"421.

What is relatively unexplored is whether the extent of declines differed by race and insurance status. An observational study was conducted using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the largest pediatric ED in Alabama for 2020 and 2019. The four subgroups of interest were African-American (AA), Non-Hispanic White (NHW), privately insured (PRIVATE), and publicly insured or self-insured (PUBLIC-SELF). Percentage changes in the 7-day moving average between dates in 2020 and 2019 were computed for total and high-severity ED visits by subgroup. Trends in percentage changes were plotted. T-tests were used to compare mean changes between subgroups. Large percentage declines in total ED visits and somewhat smaller percentage declines in high-severity visits were observed from March 2020. Declines were consistently larger for AA than NHW and for PUBLIC-SELF than PRIVATE. T-test results indicated mean date-specific percentage declines were significantly larger for AA than NHW for total visits (-38.92% [95% CI: -41.1, -36.8] versus -29.11% [95% CI: -30.8, -27.4]; p<0.001) and high-severity visits (-24.31% [95% CI: -26.2, -22.4] versus -19.49% [95% CI:-21.2, -17.8]; p<0.001), and larger for PUBLIC-SELF than PRIVATE for total visits (-36.32% [95% CI:-38.4, -34.3] versus 27.63% [95% CI:-29.2, -26.0]; p<0.001) and high-severity visits (-21.72% [95% CI: -23.5, -19.9] versus -20.01% [95% CI: -21.7, -18.3]; p = 0.04). In conclusion, significant differences by race and insurance status were observed in the decline in ED visits during the COVID19 pandemic, including high-severity visits.

We determine the minimal stimulatory element in the viral RNA required for 2A binding and show that 2A binds to this element with 1:1 stoichiometry and nanomolar affinity. We also demonstrate a critical role for bases upstream of the originally predicted stem-loop, providing evidence that an alternative pseudoknot-like conformation recently demonstrated for EMCV is a conserved feature of cardiovirus stimulatory elements.

With ongoing and future challenges posed to the field due to the pandemic, re-examining research priorities has emerged as a concern. As part of a wider project aiming to examine research priorities, here we aimed to qualitatively examine the documented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer researchers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a literature review with the aim of identifying non-peer-reviewed journalistic sources and institutional blog posts which qualitatively documented the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer researchers. We searched on 12th January 2021 using the LexisNexis database and Google, using terms and filters to identify English-language media reports and blogs, containing references to both COVID-19 and cancer research. The targeted search returned 751 results, of which 215 articles met the inclusion criteria. These 215 articles were subjected to a conventional qualitative content analysis, to document the impacts of the pandemic on the field of cancer research. Results: Our analysis yielded a high plurality of qualitatively documented impacts, from which seven categories of direct impacts emerged: (1) COVID measures halting cancer research activity entirely; (2) COVID measures limiting cancer research activity; (3) forced adaptation of research protocols; (4) impacts on cancer diagnosis, cases, and services; (5) availability of resources for cancer research; (6) disruption to the private sector; and (7) disruption to supply chains. Three categories of consequences from these impacts also emerged: (1) potential changes to future research practice; (2) delays to the progression of the field; and (3) potential new areas of research interest. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic had extensive practical and economic effects on the field of cancer research in 2020 that were highly plural in nature. Appraisal of cancer research strategies in a post-COVID world should acknowledge the potential for substantial limitations (such as on financial resources, limited access to patients for research, decreased patient access to cancer care, staffing issues, administrative delays, or supply chain issues), exacerbated cancer disparities, advances in digital health, and new areas of research related to the intersection of cancer and COVID-19.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer Researchers in 2020: A Qualitative Study of Events to Inform Mitigation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Code status orders impact clinical outcomes as well as patients and surrogates experiences.

Measles outbreaks have been associated with an increase in severe RSV infections in children younger than 6 months, probably as a result of measles-induced immunosuppression. A resurgence in measles cases was already occurring before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected global immunisation programmes, resulting in millions of children, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), missing out on their measles vaccine. This will leave many children living in the most vulnerable of circumstances highly susceptible to measles and RSV infections when current COVID-19 public health control measures are lifted.

In contrast to the classical PII encoding genes, in L. hilgardii genome the gene for PII homologue is located within the potABCD operon, encoding the ABC transporter for polyamines. Based on the unique genetic context and low sequence identity with genes of any other so-far characterized PII subfamilies, we termed this gene potN (Pot-protein, Nucleotide-binding).

We examined whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab, a monoclonal interleukin-6 receptor antibody, was associated with improved outcome. All patients received empiric antivirals, dexamethasone 6 mg/day for 7 days, antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg [two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart]. Outcome measures such as mortality on day-14, ICU length of stay, and rate of nosocomial acquired bacterial infections were also analyzed. Results: Patients were males (88.2%) aged 51 [interquartile range (IQR): 42.5-58.75)], with admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 4 score of 53 (IQR: 37.75-72.5), and had more than one comorbidity (62.3%). On admission, twenty nine patients (47.5%) were mechanically ventilated, and thirty two patients (52.5%) were receiving oxygen therapy. No serious adverse effects due to tocilizumab therapy were recorded. However, twelve patients (19.6%) developed nosocomial acquired infections.

Oral lesions, such as canker sores, are often used as an early marker of this disease condition. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, a teledentistry method is expected to assist in the management of patients with various diseases including aplastic anaemia. Purpose: This case report discusses the management of patients with aphthous-like ulcers related to aplastic anaemia in a 34-year-old woman, based on history, clinical examination, and blood tests through teledentistry. Case: The patient complained of a bleeding wound on the inner left cheek and corner of the left lip that appeared one month ago. There was an ulcer lesion that was bleeding easily in the buccal mucosa sinistra and the angular sinistra, as well as macules lesion on her hand and foot. The complete blood count test exhibits a low platelet level. Case management: The diagnosis was an aphthous-like ulcer related to aplastic anaemia. Patient was treated with topical antiseptic and anti-inflammatory mouthwashes for the oral lesions, as well as collaboration with the medical team. The lesions improved after the patient received a blood transfusion and drug therapy from the internist while she was hospitalized, but the lesions reappeared in other locations in the oral cavity when the platelet level dropped. Conclusion: Management of oral manifestations in patients with aphthous-like ulcers related to aplastic anaemia in the COVID-19 pandemic era can be done through teledentistry. However, this requires sensitivity from the dentist, patient compliance in following instructions, and the involvement of a multidisciplinary approach, such as collaboration with internists to achieve recovery.

METHODS: We utilize a system biology model of COVID-19 to analyze the effect of altering baseline patient characteristics on the outcome of immunomodulatory therapies. We create example parameter sets meant to mimic diverse patient types. For each patient type, we define the optimal treatment, identify biologic programs responsible for clinical responses, and predict biomarkers of those programs. FINDINGS: Model states representing older and hyperinflamed patients respond better to immunomodulation than those representing obese and diabetic patients. The disparate clinical responses are driven by distinct biologic programs. Optimal treatment initiation time is determined by neutrophil recruitment, systemic cytokine expression, systemic microthrombosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in older patients, and by RAS, systemic microthrombosis and trans IL6 signalling for hyperinflamed patients. For older and hyperinflamed patients, IL6 modulating therapy is predicted to be optimal when initiated very early (<4(th) day of infection) and broad immunosuppression therapy (corticosteroids) is predicted to be optimally initiated later in the disease (7(th) C 9(th) day of infection). We show that markers of biologic programs identified by the model correspond to clinically identified markers of disease severity. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that modelling of COVID-19 pathobiology can suggest biomarkers that predict optimal response to a given immunomodulatory treatment. Mathematical modelling thus constitutes a novel adjunct to predictive enrichment and may aid in the reduction of heterogeneity in critical care trials.

METHODS: A qualitative conventional content analysis approach was used to discover the nursing leadership style in the COVID-19 crisis. The present study was conducted in one hospital in Tehran, Iran. 20 Iranian nursing managers in all nursing management positions such as head nurse, matron and supervisor were interviewed. Semi-structured interview was conducted at one hospital in Iran, using reflective and open-ended questions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.

Methods: We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 104 studies with 5694 patients were included. Using RT-PCR results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients.

Using a framework modified from the World Health Organization's and the United States Pharmacopoeia's, the Bangladesh National Drug Policy (BNDP) was evaluated for provisions on quality assurance mechanisms that match regulatory functions. Newspaper, peer-reviewed and post-marketing surveillance reports were used to assess the extent of poor-quality antimicrobials in circulation. There are provisions for quality assurance in the BNDP. Newspaper reports identified the circulation of substandard antimicrobials and reported on actions by the government to seize fraudulent/falsified and expired products. Only six peer-review studies testing antimicrobial product quality were identified; the three studies with the larger sample size (over 10 samples tested) reported results of out-of-specifications products. This assessment found evidence of regulatory actions against poor-quality antimicrobials as well as news reports and studies suggesting quality concerns, but no current rigorous assessment of the extent in Bangladesh. We suggest a multi-pronged approach to regulatory system strengthening comprising three strategies: community-based surveillance, task-shifting, and technology-enabled consumer participation.","output":"The integrity of the antimicrobial supply chain in Bangladesh: assessing the regulatory environment and contextual challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, little is known about the morphologic and molecular changes in the testis of patients with COVID-19 and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility. We report here on the pathophysiology and molecular feature of testes obtained at autopsy from six men with COVID-19, as compared with those of testes from three men with age-matched, uninfected SARS-CoV-2. Our histopathological results showed that all COVID-19 patients had severe spermatogenesis damages compared with controls. Importantly, we detected the nuclear acid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, viral particles, and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in COVID-19 patient testes, and we also found ACE2 and TMPRSS2 significantly elevated in the testes from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed a prominent leukocyte infiltration, including CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD20+ B lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages, HLA-DR+ myeloid cells, and CD38+ plasma cells in the testes of COVID-19 patients. RNA-Seq analyses further revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to dysfunction of the genes that regulate the spermatogenesis and inflammation response-related pathways.

Influenza vaccines are known to be associated with some common minor adverse events of interest (AEIs), but it is not known if the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV), first offered in the 2018/2019 season, would be associated with more AEIs than other types of vaccines. OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the incidence of AEIs associated with different types of seasonal influenza vaccines offered in the 2018/2019 season. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study using computerized medical record data from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database. We extracted data on vaccine exposure and consultations for European Medicines AgencyCspecified AEIs for the 2018/2019 influenza season. We used a self-controlled case series design; computed relative incidence (RI) of AEIs following vaccination; and compared the incidence of AEIs associated with aTIV, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine. We also compared the incidence of AEIs for vaccinations that took place in a practice with those that took place elsewhere. RESULTS: A total of 1,024,160 individuals received a seasonal influenza vaccine, of which 165,723 individuals reported a total of 283,355 compatible symptoms in the 2018/2019 season. Most AEIs occurred within 7 days following vaccination, with a seasonal effect observed. Using aTIV as the reference group, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of AEIs (RI 1.46, 95% CI 1.41-1.52), whereas the live attenuated influenza vaccine was associated with a lower incidence of AEIs (RI 0.79, 95% CI 0.73-0.83). No effect of vaccination setting on the incidence of AEIs was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Routine sentinel network data offer an opportunity to make comparisons between safety profiles of different vaccines. Evidence that supports the safety of newer types of vaccines may be reassuring for patients and could help improve uptake in the future.","output":"Adverse Events of Interest Following Influenza Vaccination in the First Season of Adjuvanted Trivalent Immunization: Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) and its worldwide spread is posing one of the major threats to human health and the world economy.

STUDY DESIGN Preterm infants of gestational age <32 weeks (n = 193) were randomized to start resuscitation with either 30% oxygen (low-oxygen group) or 65% oxygen (high-oxygen group), after which the FiO2 was adjusted based on oxygen saturation values. The primary outcome was bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) assessed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Secondary outcomes included major neonatal illnesses and markers of oxidative stress. RESULTS The median gestational age of included infants was 28(6)/7 weeks (IQR, 26(5)/7-30(3)/7 weeks). The incidence of BPD was not significantly different between the low-oxygen and high-oxygen groups (24% vs. 17%; P = .15). The FiO2 in both groups was adjusted to a mean of 40% by 7 minutes in the low-oxygen group and by 11 minutes in the high-oxygen group.

In this study, to verify the role of DPP4 in the preservation of renal function, we performed a microarray analysis of the kidneys of WT and DPP4-deficient rats after STZ treatment, and gene expression analysis using rat kidneys, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and human renal cancer cells (CakI-1). The microarray analysis indicated that the expression levels of the transporter activity, heme-binding, and pheromone binding-related genes changed significantly. The results of gene expression analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in the expression levels of hemoglobin mRNA between the DPP4-deficient and WT rats; however, the expression levels of hemoglobin mRNA in the kidneys of DPP4-deficient rats tended to decrease when compared with those of both the non-STZ-treated and STZ-treated WT rats.

Therefore, the present study investigated the mental health status, risk factors, and protective factors for mental health problems in medical students in North China during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Methods: A WeChat-based survey, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and measures of social demographics, was performed twice. Risk and protective factors were identified by binary logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 702 effective questionnaires were collected in two separate surveys. In total, 24.55% of medical students were suffering anxiety to different degrees of severity, 13.18% were suffering depression in the first survey, and 3.71% wanted to give up working in primary medical care during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in the second survey. In contrast, during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, a risk factor for anxiety and depression was gender which is male, while being knowledgeable about the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and having a lower academic burden were both protective factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the communitys attitude, opinion, and willingness to pay for telemedicine and PC services during COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to create a website provision for telemedicine and PC services. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted, over five months (December 2020C April 2021), among the general population in Arabic countries, excluding pharmacists, physicians, and pharmacy students. RESULTS: A total of 1717 participants were involved, most of them were from Jordan (52.2%) and Iraq (24.8%). Sixty two percent of participants seek pharmacists advice whenever they have any medication changes and 45.1% of the participants agreed with the idea of paying pharmacists to decrease medication errors. Interestingly, 89.5% of participants encouraged the idea of creating a website that provides a PC, and 35.5% of them would pay for it.

Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patients stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.","output":"Host Response to SARS-CoV2 and Emerging Variants in Pre-Existing Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global temperature rises in response to accumulating greenhouse gases is a well-debated issue in the present time.

To address this pressing global issue, researchers are continuing to develop driver drowsiness detection systems that use a variety of measures. However, most research on drowsiness detection uses approaches based on a singular metric and, as a result, fail to attain satisfactory reliability and validity to be implemented in vehicles. METHOD: This study examines the utility of drowsiness detection based on singular and a hybrid approach. This approach considered a range of metrics from three physiological signals - electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG) - and used subjective sleepiness indices (assessed via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) as ground truth. The methodology consisted of signal recording with a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), pre-processing, extracting, and determining the important features from the physiological signals for drowsiness detection. Finally, four supervised machine learning models were developed based on the subjective sleepiness responses using the extracted physiological features to detect drowsiness levels. RESULTS: The results illustrate that the singular physiological measures show a specific performance metric pattern, with higher sensitivity and lower specificity or vice versa. In contrast, the hybrid biosignal-based models provide a better performance profile, reducing the disparity between the two metrics. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the study indicates that the selected features provided higher performance in the hybrid approaches than the singular approaches, which could be useful for future research implications. Practical Applications: Use of a hybrid approach seems warranted to improve in-vehicle driver drowsiness detection system.

This independence is ensured, among other things, by a stable and sufficient funding of the national courts, which has become a significant challenge. The resolution of such issues has been sought in recent decades, but the problem of court financing has become especially acute in the context of the economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, which occurred in 2020. This has led to somewhat hopeless feelings about the chosen way of forming the policy of Ukrainian courts financing and its implementation. Our study attempts to analyze certain aspects of the existing mechanism of financing the judiciary in Ukraine, in particular, through the prism of financial support for judges and assistant judges during the coronavirus pandemic. The functions which they perform can be attributed to the main ones during the administration of justice. The authors propose the analysis of the case on the protection of the right of assistant judges to a decent salary, which lasted for years in all courts of the state. In connection with the coronavirus pandemic in Ukraine, a law was passed reducing the salaries of judges, which is also analyzed in the article. The search for a new, more modern approach to resolving the issue of a stable financial independence of the judiciary will help to solve urgent problems and ensure a real rule of law in Ukraine.

The need for new antibiotics is high, while the arsenal of available agents is decreasing, especially for the treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are offering a promising route for novel antibiotic development and deep learning techniques can be utilised for successful AMP design. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) generative model and a bidirectional LSTM classification model were constructed to design short novel AMP sequences with potential antibacterial activity against E. coli. Two versions of the generative model and six versions of the classification model were trained and optimised using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation. These models were used to generate sets of short novel sequences that were classified as antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial. The validation accuracies of the classification models were 81.6-88.9% and the novel AMPs were classified as antimicrobial with accuracies of 70.6-91.7%. Predicted three-dimensional conformations of selected short AMPs exhibited the alpha-helical structure with amphipathic surfaces.

Pulmonary blood volume is, however, technically difficult to assess, generally requiring invasive methodology for quantification. Prior studies are limited in size and participant enrollment was selective;therefore, variation in the general population is largely unknown. We performed contrast-enhanced dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in a multicenter, community-based cohort to describe variation in pulmonary perfused blood volume (PBV) in the community. MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) recruited adults from six sites. The MESA Lung Study invited all MESA participants attending Exam 6 (2017-18), excluding those with kidney disease and contrast allergy, to undergo DECT at functional residual capacity via Siemens Flash or Force scanner: CareDose on, pitch 0.55, 0.25 sec exposure, 0.5mm slice thickness, iterative reconstruction (Admire) with Qr40 Kernel. Half concentration 370mg/ml Iopamidol was delivered at 4ml/s for the full scan, starting 17 seconds prior to scanning, including a 4 sec breath hold. PBV was calculated by material decomposition and normalized with iodine concentration in the pulmonary trunk. Generalized linear regression models included age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, weight, smoking status, site, and education.ResultsDECT scans were acquired for 714 participants, 36 of which were excluded due to image quality. Mean age of the remaining 678 participants was 71 years (range 63 - 79), 55% were male, 51% were ever smokers, and the race/ethnic distribution was 41% White, 29% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 13% Asian. Mean PBV was 468 + 151mL. The strongest demographic correlate was lower PBV with greater age (-30 mL per 10 years, 95% CI: -43, -18, p&lt;0.001). Pulmonary PBV was positively associated with height, weight, and male sex (all P&lt;0.001). PBV was lower in former compared to never smokers (p =0.04) and in Black than White participants (p=0.002), but not in Hispanic or Asian participants. There were no consistent differences across education or study site. Results were similar after adjustment for lung function and percent emphysema on CT.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first assessment of pulmonary PBV in a large, multiethnic, general community sample. Pulmonary PBV assessed by contrast-enhanced DECT was substantially reduced with advancing age and varied with body size, sex, former smoking, and, to a lesser extent, Black race.

The implications are evolutionary and epidemiological but also economic for pathogens that cause disease in crops.

We use two frameworks, one that simulates the proportional occurrence of the pathogen in the vector population with the option to eliminate vectors by a single insecticidal treatment, and one that includes vector population dynamics and the potential for multiple insecticidal sprays in a season to suppress vectors. We parameterize the models with published data on vector manipulation, crop yields as affected by the age of the plant at infection, commodity prices and costs of vector control for three pathosystems. Using the first framework, maximum returns for treating vectors are greater with vector manipulation than without it by approximately US$10 per acre (US$24.7/ha) in peas infected by Pea enation mosaic virus and Bean leaf roll virus, and approximately US$50 per acre (US$124/ha) for potatoes infected by Potato leaf roll virus. Using the second framework, maximum returns for controlling the psyllid vectors of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum are 50% greater (approximately US$400/acre, US$988/ha) but additional returns for multiple weekly sprays diminish more with vector manipulation than without it.

This is supported by evidence that is now emerging, where initial reports identify common risk factors and rare genetic variants associated with high risk for severe/ life-threatening COVID-19. Impressive global efforts have focused on either identifying common genetic factors utilizing short-read sequencing data in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or whole-exome and genome studies to interrogate the human genome at the level of detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels. However, these studies lack the sensitivity to accurately detect several classes of variants, especially large structural variants (SVs) including copy number variants (CNVs), which account for a substantial proportion of variation among individuals. Thus, we investigated the host genomes of individuals with severe/life-threatening COVID-19 at the level of large SVs (500bp-Mb level) to identify events that might provide insight into the inter-individual clinical variability in clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: Optical genome mapping using Bionano Saphyr system was performed on thirty-seven severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). To extract candidate SVs, three distinct analyses were undertaken. First, an unbiased whole-genome analysis of SVs was performed to identify rare/unique genic SVs in these patients that did not appear in population datasets to determine candidate loci as decisive predisposing factors associated with severe COVID-19. Second, common SVs with a population frequency filter was interrogated for possible association with severe COVID-19 based on literature surveys. Third, genome-wide SV enrichment in severely ill patients versus the general population was investigated by calculating odds ratios to identify top-ranked genes/loci. Candidate SVs were confirmed using qPCR and an independent bioinformatics tool (FaNDOM). Results: Our patient-centric investigation identified 11 SVs involving 38 genes implicated in three key host-viral interaction pathways: (1) innate immunity and inflammatory response, (2) airway resistance to pathogens, and (3) viral replication, spread, and RNA editing. These included seven rare/unique SVs (not present in the control dataset), identified in 24.3% (9/37) of patients, impacting up to 31 genes, of which STK26 and DPP4 are the most promising candidates. A duplication partially overlapping STK26 was corroborated with data showing upregulation of this gene in severely ill patients. Further, using a population frequency filter of less than 20% in the Bionano control dataset, four SVs involving seven genes were identified in 56.7% (21/37) of patients. Conclusion: This study is the first to systematically assess and highlight SVs' potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 severity. The genes implicated here identify novel SVs, especially STK26, and extend previous reports involving innate immunity and type I interferon response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study also shows that optical genome mapping can be a powerful tool to identify large SVs impacting disease outcomes with split survival and add valuable genomic information to the existing sequencing-based technology databases to understand the inter-individual variability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Host genome analysis of structural variations by Optical Genome Mapping provides clinically valuable insights into genes implicated in critical immune, viral infection, and viral replication pathways in patients with severe COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the impact of epilepsy, myasthenia gravis (MG), and multiple sclerosis (MS) on pregnancy and family planning decision-making in a cohort of Saudi women.

Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 M of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 m) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 M). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 M), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 M) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 M). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.","output":"Inhibition of aminopeptidases N, A and W A re-evaluation of the actions of bestatin and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone secreted from fully differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes that inhibits phosphate reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. The full-length (i.e., intact) protein mediates FGF23 endocrine functions, while endoproteolytic cleavage at a consensus cleavage sequence for the proprotein convertases (PCs) inactivates FGF23. Two PCs, furin and PC5, were shown to cleave FGF23 in vitro at RHTR(179), but whether they are fulfilling this function in vivo is currently unknown. To address this question, we used here mice lacking either or both furin and PC5 in cell-specific manners and mice lacking the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) in all cells. Our analysis shows that furin inactivation in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a 25% increase in circulating intact FGF23, without any significant impact on serum phosphate levels, whether mice are maintained on a normal or a low phosphate diet. Under conditions of iron deficiency, FGF23 is normally processed in control mice, but its processing is impaired in mice lacking furin in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In contrast, FGF23 is normally cleaved following erythropoietin or IL-1 injections in mice lacking furin or both furin and PC5, and in PACE4-deficient mice. Altogether, these studies suggest that furin is only partially responsible for FGF23 cleavage under certain conditions in vivo. The processing of FGF23 may therefore involve the redundant action of multiple PCs or of other peptidases in osteoblasts, osteocytes and hematopoietic cells.","output":"In Vivo Analysis of the Contribution of Proprotein Convertases to the Processing of FGF23"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many women stand to lose no-cost birth control.","output":"Supreme Court Upholds Rules Allowing Some Employers to Opt Out of Contraceptive Coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This hospital-based study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status and dietary habits for COVID-19 patients, the amount of nutrients provided to the patients in the hospital and to detect the predictors of severity among COVID-19 patients in Jordan.

The assay was optimized by selecting the best batch and concentration of fetal bovine serum, -mercaptoethanol concentration, cell density, BrdU incubation time and antigen presenting cell type. Cats were vaccinated with the attenuated Nobivac vaccine Tricat and the peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation responses were quantified upon in vitro restimulation with inactivated and infectious feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and felid herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1). Proliferation signals were detected with inactivated FeHV-1 in the CD8(+) but not in the CD8(?)

METHODS Human ARPE19 cells were incubated with 25 M N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) and irradiated with blue light. Expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and XBP1s were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. STF-083010 was used to suppress XBP1s expression. ARPE19 cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and flow cytometry. Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) was detected by Western blot. Changes in the morphology of ARPE19 cells were identified by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS Blue light-induced A2E-containing ARPE19 cell damage caused a transient elevation of GRP78 and XBP1s, while RIP3 rose in the late stage. STF-083010 effectively inhibited XBP1s expression and brought about the aggravation of apoptosis together with an alleviation of RIP3 expression. Most of the dying cells exhibited apoptotic morphology. CONCLUSION A2E, along with blue light, brought about apoptosis and necroptosis of ARPE19 cells, and XBP1s was transiently elevated. The suppression of XBP1s induced ARPE19 cell death by promoting apoptosis rather than necroptosis.

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all ages, particularly for newborns and children under the age of 5 (goal 3b), it is essential to generate and use quality data for evidence-based decision making to overcome barriers inherent in immunization systems. In Pakistan, only 66 % of children receive all basic vaccinations, and in Sindh province, the number is even lower at 49 %. In 2012, IRD developed and piloted Zindagi Mehfooz (Safe Life; ZM) ElR, an Android-based platform that records and analyses individual-level child data in real-time. In 2017 in collaboration with Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) Sindh, ZM was scaled-up across the entire Sindh province and is currently being used by 2521 government vaccinators in 1539 basic health facilities, serving >48 million population. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to demonstrate how big immunization data from the ZM-EIR is being leveraged in Sindh, Pakistan for actionable decision making via three use cases (a) improving performance management of vaccinators to increase geographical coverage, (b) quantifying the impact of provincial accelerated outreach activities, and (c) examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization coverage to help devise a tailored approach for future efforts. METHODS: From October 2017 to April 2020, more than 2.9 million children and 0.9 million women have been enrolled, and more than 22 million immunization events have been recorded in the ZM-EIR. We extracted de-identified data from ZM-EIR for January 1, 2019 - April 20, 2020, period. Given the needs of each use case, monthly and daily indicators on vaccinator performance (attendance and compliance), daily immunization visits, and the number of antigens administered were calculated. Geo-coordinate data of antigen administration was extracted and displayed on geographic maps using QGIS. All generated reports were shared at fixed frequency with various stakeholders, such as partners at EPI-Sindh, for utilization in decision making and informing policy. RESULT: Our use-cases demonstrate the use of EIR data for data-driven decision making. From January - December 2019, the monthly monitoring of program indicators helped increase the vaccinator attendance from 44% to 88%, while an 85 % increase in geographical coverage was observed in a polio-endemic super high-risk union council (SHRUC) in Karachi. The analysis of daily average antigens administered during accelerated outreach efforts (AOE) as compared to routine activities showed an increase in average daily Pentavalent-3, Measles-1, and Measles-2 vaccines administered by 103%, 154%, and 180% respectively. These findings helped decide to continue the accelerated effort in high-risk areas (compared to the entire province) rather than discontinuing the activity due to high costs. During COVID-19 lockdown, the daily average number of child immunizations reduced from 16,649 to 4335 per day, a decline of 74% compared to 6 months preceding COVID-19 lockdown. ZM-EIR data is currently helping to shape the planning and implementation of critical strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The big data for vaccines generated through EIRs is a powerful tool to monitor immunization work-force and ensure chronically missed communities are identified and covered through targeted strategies. Geospatial data availability and analysis is changing the way EPI review meetings occur with stakeholders, taking data-driven decisions for better planning and resource allocation. In the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, as governments gradually begin to shift from containing the outbreak to strategizing a plan for sustaining the essential health services, the countries that will emerge most successful are likely the ones who can best use technology and real-time data for targeted efforts.","output":"Using a low-cost, real-time electronic immunization registry in Pakistan to demonstrate utility of data for immunization programs and evidence-based decision making to achieve SDG-3: Insights from analysis of Big Data on vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been few studies performed to examine the pathophysiological differences between different types of psychosis, such as between delusional disorder () and schizophrenia (SZ).

Home visits and PLA meetings will be facilitated by auxiliary nurse midwives. The hypothesis is as follows: Haemoglobin of women at 30  2 weeks gestation is  0.4 g/dL higher in the intervention arm than in the control. A sample of 842 women (421 per arm, average 15.6 per cluster) will provide 88% power, assuming SD 1.2, ICC 0.09 and CV of cluster size 0.27. Outcomes are captured at 30  2 weeks gestation. Primary outcome is haemoglobin concentration (g/dL). Secondary outcomes are as follows: anaemia prevalence (%), mid-upper arm circumference (cm), mean probability of micronutrient adequacy (MPA) and number of ANC visits at a health facility. Indicators to assess pathways to impact include number of IFA tablets consumed during pregnancy, intake of energy (kcal/day) and dietary iron (mg/day), a score of bioavailability-enhancing behaviours and recall of one nutrition knowledge indicator.

SETTING: A multicenter study including three Indianapolis area academic hospitals. PATIENTS: Two-hundred forty consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were admitted to one of three hospitals. One-hundred nine critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received routine subcutaneous chemical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome of this study was to determine the frequency of venous thromboembolism and the degree of inflammatory and coagulation marker elevation associated with venous thromboembolism development. Descriptive statistics outlined the frequency of venous thromboembolism at any time during severe coronavirus disease 2019. Clinical course and laboratory metrics were compared between patients that developed venous thromboembolism and patients that did not develop venous thromboembolism. Hypercoagulable thromboelastography was defined as two or more hypercoagulable parameters. MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred nine patients developed severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring ICU care.

Nucleases-based genome editing (aka gene editing) depends on cellular responses to a targeted double-strand break (DSB). The first truly targetable reagents were zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) showing that arbitrary DNA sequences within a mammalian genome, could be addressed by protein engineering, ushering in the era of genome editing. ZFNs that are fusions of zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and FokI cleavage domain, resulted from the basic research on Type IIs FokI restriction enzyme, which showed a bipartite structure with a separable DNA-binding domain and a non-specific cleavage domain. Studies on 3-finger ZFNs established that the preferred substrates were paired binding sites, which doubled the size of the target recognition sequence from 9 to 18 bp that is large enough to specify a unique genomic locus in plant and mammalian cells, including human cells. Subsequently, a ZFN-induced DSB was shown to stimulate homologous recombination in frog eggs. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that are based on bacterial TALEs fused to FokI cleavage domain expanded the capability. ZFNs and TALENs have been successfully used to modify a multitude of recalcitrant organisms and cell types that were unapproachable previously attesting to the success of protein engineering, long before the arrival of CRISPR. The recent technique to deliver a targeted DSB to cellular genomes are RNA-guided nucleases as exemplified by the Type II prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs that use protein motifs for DNA sequence recognition, CRISPR-Cas9 depends on RNA-DNA recognition. The advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which include ease of RNA design for new targets and dependence on a single constant Cas9 protein, have led to its wide adoption by research labs around the world. The 2020 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanualle Charpentier for harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 system to provide a simplified technique for genome editing. The programmable nucleases have also been shown to cut at off-target sites with mutagenic consequences, which is a serious concern for human therapeutic applications. Therefore, applications of genome editing technologies to human therapeutics will ultimately depend on risk versus benefit analysis and informed consent","output":"Genome Editing Revolution in Life Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implicit racial bias is a persistent and pervasive challenge within healthcare education and training settings. A recent systematic review reported that 84% of included studies (31 out of 37) showed evidence of slight to strong pro-white or light skin tone bias amongst healthcare students and professionals. However, there remains a need to improve understanding about its impact on healthcare students and how they can be better supported. This narrative review provides an overview of current evidence regarding the role of implicit racial bias within healthcare education, considering trends, factors that contribute to bias, and possible interventions. Current evidence suggests that biases held by students remain consistent and may increase during healthcare education. Sources that contribute to the formation and maintenance of implicit racial bias include peers, educators, the curriculum, and placements within healthcare settings. Experiences of implicit racial bias can lead to psychosomatic symptoms, high attrition rates, and reduced diversity within the healthcare workforce. Interventions to address implicit racial bias include an organizational commitment to reducing bias in hiring, retention, and promotion processes, and by addressing misrepresentation of race in the curriculum. We conclude that future research should identify, discuss, and critically reflect on how implicit racial biases are enacted and sustained through the hidden curriculum and can have detrimental consequences for racial and ethnic minority healthcare students.","output":"Understanding Healthcare Students Experiences of Racial Bias: A Narrative Review of the Role of Implicit Bias and Potential Interventions in Educational Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last 12-months during the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued public health instructions with the hope of mitigating the spread of the virus.

The steadily rising demand at EDs creates a constant challenge to provide adequate quality of care while maintaining standards and productivity. Managing hospital demand effectively requires an adequate knowledge of the future rate of admission. We develop a novel predictive framework to understand the temporal dynamics of hospital demand. METHODS: We compare and combine state-of-the-art forecasting methods to predict hospital demand 1, 3 or 7 days into the future. In particular, our analysis compares machine learning algorithms to more traditional linear models as measured in a mean absolute error (MAE) and we consider two different hyperparameter tuning methods, enabling a faster deployment of our models without compromising performance. We believe our framework can readily be used to forecast a wide range of policy relevant indicators. RESULTS: We find that linear models often outperform machine learning methods and that the quality of our predictions for any of the forecasting horizons of 1, 3 or 7 days are comparable as measured in MAE. Our approach is able to predict attendances at these emergency departments one day in advance up to a mean absolute error of 14 and 10 patients corresponding to a mean absolute percentage error of 6.8% and 8.6% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Simple linear methods like generalized linear models are often better or at least as good as ensemble learning methods like the gradient boosting or random forest algorithm. However, though sophisticated machine learning methods are not necessarily better than linear models, they improve the diversity of model predictions so that stacked predictions can be more robust than any single model including the best performing one.","output":"A unified machine learning approach to time series forecasting applied to demand at emergency departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A disruption of the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the lung (gut-lung axis) has been implicated as a driver of severity during respiratory-related diseases. Lung injury causes systemic inflammation, which disrupts gut barrier integrity, increasing the permeability to gut microbes and their products. This exacerbates inflammation, resulting in positive feedback. To test the possibility that a disrupted gut contributes to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, we used a systems biology approach to analyze plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and controls. Severe COVID-19 is associated with a dramatic increase in tight junction permeability and translocation of bacterial and fungal products into blood. This intestinal disruption and microbial translocation correlate strongly with increased systemic inflammation and complement activation, lower gut metabolic function, and higher mortality.

Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0). The accurate differential diagnosis provided by this novel combination of viral- and bacterial-induced proteins has the potential to improve management of patients with acute infections and reduce antibiotic misuse.","output":"A Novel Host-Proteome Signature for Distinguishing between Acute Bacterial and Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of COVID-19 affects both physical and mental health of pregnant women. This study focuses on their psychological status, and analyzes the main factors affecting their emotions of pregnant women so as to provide guidance for psychological counseling and social intervention during epidemics. METHODS: Multiple researchers distributed a questionnaire online via the Internet. Pregnant women volunteered, and the questionnaire was automatically collected in the background. RESULTS: The 298 valid questionnaires recovered showed that 82 cases of pregnant women were in states of anxiety, accounting for 27.51%, of which 78.05% were mild (82 cases), 19.51% were moderate (16 cases), and 2.44% were severe (2 cases). Moreover, 31.21% of pregnant women were in states of depression (93 cases), of which 52.69% were mild (49 cases), 40.86% were moderate (38 cases), and 6.45% were severe (6 cases). The risk factors for states of anxiety or depression were fear of fetal malformation or genetic disease, history of adverse pregnancy, can't do routine prenatal examination, and insufficient support and care from husbands and families. Besides, 16 cases had sought psychological help during the epidemic, among whom 62.50% (10 cases) experienced anxiety, 68.75% (11 cases) had depression.

METHODS: This analysis reports herein further studies based on time-course microarray analysis with focus on malaria-induced host immune response. RESULTS: The results show that in early malaria, selected immune response-related genes were up-regulated including   and  interferon-related genes, as well as genes of IL-15, CD36, chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, S100A8/9, CXCL9, and CXCL11), TRAIL and IgG Fc receptors. During acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes included   and  interferon-related genes, IL-8, IL-1b IL-10 downstream genes, TGFB1, oncostatin-M, chemokines, IgG Fc receptors, ADCC signalling, complement-related genes, granzymes, NK cell killer/inhibitory receptors and Fas antigen. During recovery, genes for NK receptorsand granzymes/perforin were up-regulated. When viewed in terms of immune response type, malaria infection appeared to induce a mixed TH1 response, in which  and  interferon-driven responses appear to predominate over the more classic IL-12 driven pathway. In addition, TH17 pathway also appears to play a significant role in the immune response to P. falciparum. Gene markers of TH17 (neutrophil-related genes, TGFB1 and IL-6 family (oncostatin-M)) and TH (IFN- and NK cytotoxicity and ADCC gene) immune response were up-regulated. Initiation of TH immune response was associated with an IFN- response, which ultimately resulted in moderate-mild IFN- achieved via a pathway different from the more classic IL-12 TH1 pattern.

To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing effective cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BCs). METHODS: In our study, we explored the use of alternative antigen trafficking through use of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to enhance vaccine efficacy against HER2 and other model antigens in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: We found that inclusion of this domain in plasmid vaccines effectively trafficked antigens to endolysosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II presentation. Additionally, this augmented the expansion/activation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also led to elevated levels of antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. Significantly, vaccination with HER2-LAMP produced tumor regression in ~30% of vaccinated mice with established tumors in an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, compared with 0% of HER2-WT vaccinated mice. This therapeutic benefit is associated with enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era.

The agencys broad functions, including coordination among 194 members, cannot be performed by any other entity. However, despite experts well-articulated concerns that the agencys legitimacy and authority in global health matters have been undermined, a decades-long freeze on member assessments means that WHO priorities are disproportionately influenced by a few powerful donors. A STRUCTURAL DEFECT: To overcome inertia in addressing well-known limitations, it may be helpful to consider the weaknesses in WHOs financing mechanism as a persistent structural defect. This perspective strengthens the focus on corrections needed to remove the defect. In our view, the main features of the structural defect are the self-imposed constraints that foster the perceptionif not the realitythat the agencys legitimacy is compromised. These constraints include WHOs inadequate level of financing; lack of direct control over 80% of its funds; and unbalanced participation, such that over 60% of financing originates from only 9 donors. With renewed commitment, however, member countries can remove these constraints. REMOVING THE STRUCTURAL DEFECT: To meaningfully strengthen structural integrity of the financing mechanism, restore WHOs autonomy, and minimize concerns about wealthy-donor supremacy, it will be necessary to define specific requirements and implement restrictions on financial contributions. We make five recommendations, including tripling total financing; ensuring that 70% or more of financial support derives from member assessments; limiting contributions from individual members to a maximum of 4% of total WHO financing; and limiting donations from individual partners to a maximum of 3% of total WHO financing (1% for earmarked donations). Although some might consider these measures impractical, they are justified by the magnitude of the crises the world faces, by member states increased economic strength in recent decades, and by the importance of shielding the WHOs financing structure from perceived neocolonialism. This necessary step calls for an adjustment of priorities: the higher level of assessed contributionfrom nearly all members regardless of wealthrequired to reach the proposed targets would still represent only a small fraction of most members annual military expenditures. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic, with its devastating toll on human life and global economic stability, presents an opportunity for reflection and refocusing. Realigning WHOs financial structure to its founders vision, as proposed here, would likely safeguard both the agencys autonomy and member states trust, while alleviating concerns about undue influence from powerful donors. Removing the persistent structural defect in financing would empower WHO to lead and coordinate global response to meet the inevitable challenges of the coming decades.

The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. It is also not known to what extent the natural production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is protective against re-infection.Methods: A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. New infections post antibody testing were recorded to determine if the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protect against re-infection.Results: A total of 2063 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. 300 HCW had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11/231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). HCW therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (Odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.3% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies. 18.7% of HCW had an asymptomatic infection. There were 38 new infections with SARS-CoV-2 in HCW who were previously antibody negative and 1 symptomatic RT-PCR positive re-infection in a HCW who had detectable antibodies 76 days prior to re-infection. The presence of antibodies was therefore associated with an 85% reduced risk of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.35, p=0.026).Conclusion: In this study, HCW were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.

The issues of food safety and food poisoning are being increasingly emphasised, particularly in developed countries. Infection/contamination with many agents i.e., bacterial, parasitic and viral entities can result in foodborne illness. This article will focus mainly on viral agents of infection. A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents. Despite these constraints, it is now evident that there are both well-established and emerging viruses implicated in foodborne infections, and the role of molecular detection and characterisation is becoming increasingly important.","output":"Viruses Associated With Foodborne Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since November 2019, the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for several cases worldwide, becoming pandemic in March 2020.

Public hospitals have set adapted strategies dedicated to overcoming the overload of COVID-19 patients, and our Oncology and Hematology Center (OHC) has implemented a flexible adapted strategy aiming to reduce the burden of COVID-19. We report our single-center experience on the detailed infection control measures undertaken to minimize virus transmission. Methods: we reviewed all patients treated at the OHC from March 2nd to April 20th, 2020 as measures were taken since the detection of the first COVID-19 case to ensure the protection of patients and healthcare providers, especially a screening zone for any patient entering the center. The patient's data were retrospectively collected and anonymized. Results: we notified a significant decrease in patients' admissions during the lockdown period at the different units of our center. The screening area received a total of 5267 patients during our study period, with an average of 105 patients per day. Interestingly, no healthcare professional was infected and only 8 patients showed symptoms of fever and cough, and all of them had a negative test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR). Thus, the OHC is considered as a COVID-19 free center with zero cases among patients and healthcare providers.

This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","output":"Surfactant Proteins A and D: Trimerized Innate Immunity Proteins with an Affinity for Viral Fusion Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak shows that pandemics and epidemics can seriously wreak havoc on supply chains (SC) around the globe.

A deep learning model was constructed utilizing a stacked 1-D convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pre-processed genomic sequencing data of the four SARS-CoV-2 variants were first fed to three stacked convolution-pooling nets to extract local linkage patterns in the sequences. Then a 2-layer MLP was used to compute the correlations between the input and output. Finally, a logistic regression model transformed the output and returned the probability values. Learning curves and stratified 10-fold cross-validation showed that the proposed classifier enables robust variant classification. External validation of the classifier showed an accuracy of 0.9962, precision of 0.9963, recall of 0.9963 and F1 score of 0.9962, outperforming other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest.

SETTING Quarantine hospital for patients with SARS in Hong Kong. PATIENTS 267 consecutive patients hospitalized from 26 February to 31 March 2003 for probable or confirmed SARS. MEASUREMENTS Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic measures; 3-month mortality rate. RESULTS According to our case definition, there were 227 cases of confirmed SARS and 40 cases of probable SARS. Common presenting symptoms were fever (99% of patients), chills (74%), malaise (63%), and myalgia (50%). Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (73%), thrombocytopenia (50%), hyponatremia (60%), and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (47%) and C-reactive protein (75%). During hospitalization, incidence of diarrhea (53%), anemia (53%), and acute renal failure (6%) increased. Sixty-nine patients (26%) required intensive care because of respiratory failure. The 3-month mortality rate was 12% (95% CI, 8% to 16%). Factors contributing to mortality were respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and nosocomial sepsis. On multivariate Cox regression, age older than 60 years (relative risk, 5.10 [CI, 2.30 to 11.31]; P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 3.8 micro kat/L at presentation (relative risk, 2.20 [CI, 1.03 to 4.71]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality.

Mitigation efforts, like shelter-in-place orders, have taken a particular toll on parents who have had to navigate disruptions in work and/or school schedules. Research from high-income countries demonstrates increased parental anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout resulting from the pandemic. It is unclear if these outcomes are the same for parents in high-risk communities in low-income countries where pre-pandemic conditions were deleterious. This study addresses this gap and examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on parents in high-risk communities in Guatemala. METHODS: A total of 330 individuals from 11 districts in Guatemala participated in the study and were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health impairment. Chi-squares were conducted for bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed differences between groups on burnout, with parents more often reporting feelings of burnout than nonparents (p < .001). Binary regression demonstrated that non-parents were 70% less likely to endorse feelings of stress as compared to parents (OR = .285; p = .014). CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the unique mental health impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on parents in high-risk communities. In high-risk communities, parental stress is a pressing problem that, if unaddressed, has the potential to result in even greater psychological distress and child maltreatment. Training community healthcare providers to assess and address parental stress can lead to increased community capacity and the development of a community-based network to serve as a first line of support for parents and their children.","output":"Mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on parents in high-risk, low income communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) is a virus that can spread rapidly from human to human.

OBJECTIVES to analyze COVID-19 epidemic data by gender and age in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden, characterized by having implemented different pandemic containment policies, with the aim of observing any characteristics that can be interpreted with the lens of sex/gender differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS we used confirmed cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and Sweden from respective national surveillance databases. Mortality data for Italy were also analysed. The period of investigation was March-May 2020. As indicators, we used the case fatality ratio adjusted for time delay and SMR for mortality. RESULTS women are more vulnerable to COVID- 19 infection in the 30-60-year age group. Case fatality ratio is higher in men than women, with a ratio men/women equal to 1.7 in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and 1,4 in Germany. The ratio increases in the lower age groups. The analysis of the mortality data observed/expected in Italy in the same period with respect to 2015-2019 shows a comparable excess with SMR equal to 132 for men and 127 for women. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 affects both genders with some differences in the incidence, higher in women, and lethality, higher in men. These differences highlight the need to better understand the sex/gender and age interaction both for epidemiological surveillance and for a better gender-appropriateness of the ongoing prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This would be possible if all health indicators (symptoms, past illnesses, primary and hospital-level health care, hospitalization, etc.) were provided by age and gender. Analysis of the causes of death could help to better understand the increase in mortality for both genders, in particular for women, for whom a lower lethality for COVID-19 appears from data.","output":"[Sex/gender differences in COVID-19 lethality: what the data say, and do not say]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anxiolytics (N05B) are one of the most widely used pharmacological groups.

In this work, we investigate the possible causes. If we think of TV robots (robotic cameras, dollys) as social robots, their level of adoption in the industry would depend on how Social they are, which we can improve through positive perception and an effective Human-Robot Interaction framework. To validate this, we interviewed a crew of camera operators about TV robots. 60% reported negative feelings;fears of loss of jobs and relevance, but 60% wanted to learn more. Based on that, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT)- enabled Robotic Camera Dolly (IRCD) for the operators, with a companion interview/guidance protocol;the Pre and Post Interview Protocol, to monitor their reactions. Next, we deployed the IRCD at their TV station, where they completed a set of filming tasks using the IRCD. There was a jump in perception, with 60% positive feelings, 95% wanting to learn more, and 95% successfully completing their robot-powered filming tasks. Also, the IRCD registered a 0.15s response time and 5s video delay time, well within industry limits. These results show that positive perception and effective HRI could stimulate the adoption of Robotics in the TV Film industry.

We synthesized also AgNPs with natural cinnamon bark extract (Cinn) in combination with PI and coated biodegradable Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) sutures with the new materials separately. These compounds (TCA-AgNP, TCA-AgNP-PI, Cinn-AgNP, and Cinn-AgNP-PI) and their dip-coated PGA sutures were tested against 10 reference strains of microorganisms and five antibiotics by zone inhibition with disc- and agar-well-diffusion methods. The new compounds TCA-AgNP-PI and Cinn-AgNP-PI are broad spectrum microbicidal agents and therefore potential coating materials for sutures to prevent Surgical Site Infections (SSI). TCA-AgNP-PI inhibits the studied pathogens stronger than Cinn-AgNP-PI in-vitro and on coated sutures.

With high Interleukin -6 (IL-6) levels reported in COVID-19 related deaths in China, IL-6 is considered to be the key player in COVID-19 cytokine storm. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, is used on compassionate grounds for treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm. The aim of this study was to assess effect of tocilizumab on mortality due to COVID-19 cytokine storm. METHOD: This retrospective, observational study included patients of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent hypoxia (defined as saturation 94% or less on supplemental Oxygen of 15 L per minute through non-rebreathing mask or PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200) who were admitted to a tertiary care center in Mumbai, India, between 31st March to 5th July 2020. In addition to standard care, single Inj. Tocilizumab 400 mg was given intravenously to 151 consecutive COVID-19 patients with persistent hypoxia, from 13th May to 5th July 2020. These 151 patients were retrospectively analysed and compared with historic controls, ie consecutive COVID-19 patients with persistent hypoxia, defined as stated above (N = 118, from our first COVID-19 admission on 31st March to 12th May 2020 i.e., till tocilizumab was available in hospital). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed for identifying predictors of survival. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 26. RESULTS: Out of 269 (151 in tocilizumab group and 118 historic controls) patients studied from 31st March to 5th July 2020, median survival in the tocilizumab group was significantly longer than in the control group; 18 days (95% CI, 11.3 to 24.7) versus 9 days (95% CI, 5.7 to 12.3); log rank p 0.007. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, independent predictors of survival were use of tocilizumab (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.427-0.903, P 0.013) and higher oxygen saturation. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab may improve survival in severe COVID-19 pneumonia with persistent hypoxia.

When using controlling apps (e.g., a smartphone app), Duenna makes sure that only legitimate SHS users are allowed to operate their Internet of things (IoT) devices. Duenna is built upon a behavioral anomaly detection (BAD)-based approach. In particular, we hypothesize that SHS users usually operate their home IoT devices in typical and distinctive patterns. Therefore, users that attempt to operate devices differently from such a regular behavior are considered malicious. Technically, Duenna operates in two modes. In an initialization operation, Duenna first collects and processes the historical cyber and physical activities of an SHS user in addition to the historical states of the SHS itself to build a set of incremental anomaly detection (AD) models. Then, in an interactive operation, the trained AD models are, then, used as a baseline from which anomalous commands (i.e., outliers) are detected and rejected, while regular commands (i.e., targets) are considered legitimate and allowed to be executed. Through an empirical evaluation conducted on real-world data, Duenna exhibits high authentication rates ensuring both security and user experience. The findings obtained from such evaluation show that a user behavior-based approach is a promising security scheme that could be integrated into existing SHS platforms.","output":"Anomalous behavior detection-based approach for authenticating smart home system users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine has been in existence for decades with little traction for global mainstream medicine. However, COVID-19 has exposed the importance of providing continued care for patients while minimizing the risk of exposure during pandemics.

There has been tremendous growth and innovation in various digital applications that facilitate telehealth as the platforms continue to improve. Even in the absence of a pandemic, telemedicine allows for care of patients who may live in remote areas or have issues with transportation and comorbidities prohibiting ambulation. This study is based on a questionnaire for healthcare providers who have been exposed to telemedicine during COVID-19.

METHODS: Our ethics committee created an ethical watch system based on 24/7 shifts to assist practitioners in their daily decisions. We discuss the challenges faced by patients with cancer during the pandemic, such as access to critical care and ethical dilemmas in the context of resource scarcity, as well as the issue of isolation of patients. We also debate the restrictions in access to oncology care in a health context strongly 'prioritised' against COVID-19. RESULTS: In all areas of an ethical dilemma, either for sorting out access to critical care or for the dramatic consequences of prolonged isolation of patients, our common thread was our attempt to protect, whenever possible, the principles of deontological ethics by strictly resisting utilitarian pressure. Respecting democratic health decision-making processes is a cornerstone of ethically relevant decisions, including in the context of a sanitary crisis. CONCLUSION: The role of an ethics committee related to real-life situations includes not only a reflexive perspective in respect of fundamental principles, but also the help to enlighten and resolve ethical dilemmas in complex clinical situations.

METHODS Data from 2400 participants (age = 59.3  6.9 yr, body mass index = 36.1  5.9 kgm) with accelerometry data from the Look AHEAD trial were included in the analyses. Participants randomized to ILI were instructed to reduce caloric intake and progress to 175 minwk of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA), whereas those randomized to Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) served as the control group. PA was measured at baseline, year 1, and year 4 using an RT3 accelerometer, and bout-related MVPA (PA 3 METs, accumulated in bouts of 10 min in duration) was calculated. RESULTS Despite no differences at baseline (ILI = 93.4  152.7 vs DSE = 88.4  143.6 minwk), bout-related MVPA was significantly greater in ILI compared with DSE at year 1 (151.0  213.5 vs 87.5  145.1 minwk, P < 0.0001) and year 4 (102.9  195.6 vs 73.9  267.5 minwk, P < 0.001), and more ILI participants achieved 175 minwk at year 1 (29.1% vs 16.3%, P < 0.001) and year 4 (18.3% vs 10.0%, P < 0.001).

The current literature suggests that people affected by COVID-19 may have a high burden of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attack, irrational anger, impulsivity, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal behavior. Moreover, several factors associated with mental health problems in COVID-19 are found, which include age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, place of living, close contact with people with COVID-19, comorbid physical and mental health problems, exposure to COVID-19 related news and social media, coping styles, stigma, psychosocial support, health communication, confidence in health services, personal protective measures, risk of contracting COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the epidemiological distribution of mental health problems and associated factors were heterogeneous among the general public, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare providers.

The RAS is primarily responsible for blood pressure control via the classic pathway. Recently numerous other pathological processes have been described due to stimulation of this classic pathway.

The other clinical symptoms in decreasing rates were headache (10.8%), myalgia (5.4%), sore throat (3.2%), shortness of breath (3.2%), diarrhea (2.2%) and abdominal pain in one child. In 7 (7.5%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, coinfection was detected. Two were with rhinovirus/enterovirus, two were with Coronavirus NL63, one was with adenovirus, and one was with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In one patient, two additional respiratory agents (rhinovirus/enterovirus and adenovirus) were detected. There was a significantly longer hospital stay in patients with coinfection (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Although the coinfection rate was low in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in our study, we found coinfection as a risk factor for length of hospital stay in the coinfected patient group.","output":"Coinfection in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Children Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We conducted a real-world analysis of the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens for bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) in a Chinese population. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2017. Patients with BSIs caused by CR-GNB confirmed by in vitro susceptibility tests were enrolled, and patient medical record data on antimicrobial agents and microbiological and clinical outcomes were extracted. Results: A total of 175 individuals were included; 127 individuals (72.6%) received combination therapy (two or more antibiotics), while 48 individuals (27.4%) received monotherapy (single antibiotic). The all-cause 28-day mortality was 20.0%. Treatment success or presumed success rates were very similar between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups (58.3% versus 59.1%; P = 0.931). Combination therapy had a higher success rate trend than monotherapy in septic shock patients (40.7% versus 18.2%; P = 0.268). Improved therapeutic effects were observed in the active agent-containing group, although the differences were not significant. Conclusion: Combination therapy likely has better therapeutic effects on critical BSIs caused by CR-GNB than monotherapy.

Evidence pointed out the fact that virus might first originated in bats in China and it took only 2 months to spread over almost every country of the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to beta coronavirus and is enveloped, positive sense, and single-stranded RNA virus. The treatment would be difficult as SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus the mutation rate is higher in comparison with the DNA viruses. The virus infection also leads to generation of effective protective immune response of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and so on that may help in virus elimination. The speed of the global spread of the current pandemic is of major concern and it has created a significant threat to economic and human health across the world. In India, the infection spreads with an infection and fatality rates of the disease are 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively.

The continuous ongoing research and clinical trials paved the way for vaccines. But, the vaccine efficacy in the long run is still questionable due to the mutating coronavirus, which makes drug re-positioning a reasonable alternative. COVID-19 has hence fast-paced drug re-positioning for the treatment of COVID-19 and its symptoms. This work builds computational models using matrix completion techniques to predict drug-virus association for drug re-positioning. The aim is to assist clinicians with a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right set of antivirals for the mutated isolate. The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide, which is a novel Tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to its original counterpart (older version) Tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail, the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also demonstrate how the drugs to be used against the virus would vary as SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time by predicting the drugs for the mutated strains, suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction. We believe this work would open up possibilities for applying machine learning models to clinical research for drug-virus association prediction and other similar biological problems.","output":"A computational approach to aid clinicians in selecting anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Thrombotic events (TE) represent one of the major complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective is to evaluate vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in COVID-19 patients, and compare the findings with healthy controls. The secondary objective is to evaluate if there are differences in OCTA parameters between COVID-19 patients with and without associated TE. METHODS: Cross-sectional case-control study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with and without TE related to the infection and age-matched healthy controls. Ophthalmological examination and OCTA were performed 12 weeks after diagnosis. Demographic data and medical history were collected. Macular OCTA parameters in the superficial retinal plexus were analyzed according to ETDRS sectors. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included, 19 (20%) COVID-19 patients with associated TE, 47 (49.5%) COVID-19 patients without TE, and 29 (30.5%) healthy controls. Fifty-three (55.7%) were male, mean age 54.4 (SD 10.2) years. COVID-19 patients presented significantly lower VD than healthy controls: central (p = 0.003), inner ring (p = 0.026), outer ring (p = 0.001). PD was also significantly decreased: outer ring (p = 0.003), full area (p = 0.001). No differences in OCTA parameters were found between COVID-19 patients with and without TE. CONCLUSIONS: OCTA represents a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of microvascular changes in COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower VD and PD compared to healthy controls. However, no differences were found between COVID-19 when considering TE. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate the retinal microvascular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the vasculature of other organs.","output":"Reduced macular vessel density in COVID-19 patients with and without associated thrombotic events using optical coherence tomography angiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Derangements in coagulation profile due to on-going anticoagulant medication can complicate the most primitive physiology in a woman, ovulation. Unmonitored anticoagulant therapy can lead to an array of complications, one of which is intraperitoneal haemorrhage secondary to numerous medical and surgical conditions. The resultant haemoperitoneum can cause sudden hypovolemic shock, especially in a patient with compromised cardiovascular status. This report narrates the case of a 30 years old nulliparous female patient on anticoagulant therapy, operated for multiple cardiac defects and developed massive haemoperitoneum as a consequence of ovulation. The patient presented in shock to the Emergency Department with unstable haemodynamic status. A multi-disciplinary approach to the case converged on ruptured functional ovarian cyst as a working diagnosis. Conservative management of haemoperitoneum was decided upon, whereby correcting shock and providing pro-coagulant therapy along with blood products was the main line of management. All efforts failed soon after when the cyst wall ruptured catastrophically, leading to collapse of the general condition of the patient. Surgical approach was undertaken and a ruptured ovarian cyst wall was identified to be the cause. The cyst wall was subsequently repaired electrosurgically and the patient recovered well with an uneventful postoperative period. However, the characteristic feature of this case is the lack of follow-up due to lockdown restrictions of this continuum, the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The spatial location of the increased stiffness among plantar flexors and its variability among survivors remain unknown. This study assessed the mechanical properties of the lower leg muscles in stroke survivors during passive dorsiflexions. Stiffness was estimated through the measurement of the shear modulus. Two experiments were independently conducted, in which participants lay supine: with the knee extended ( experiment 1, n = 13 stroke survivors and n = 13 controls), or with the knee flexed at 90 ( experiment 2, n = 14 stroke survivors and n = 14 controls). The shear modulus of plantar flexors [gastrocnemius medialis (three locations), gastrocnemius lateralis (three locations), soleus (two locations), flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus), peroneus longus] and dorsiflexors (tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus) was measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography during passive dorsiflexions (2/s). At the same ankle angle, stroke survivors displayed higher shear modulus than controls for gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis (knee extended) and soleus (knee flexed). Very low shear modulus was found for the other muscles. The adjustment for muscle slack angle suggested that the increased shear modulus was arising from consequences of contractures. The stiffness distribution between muscles was consistent across participants with the highest shear modulus reported for the most distal regions of gastrocnemius medialis (knee extended) and soleus (knee flexed). These results provide a better appreciation of stiffness locations among plantar flexors of stroke survivors and can provide evidence for the implementation of clinical trials to evaluate targeted interventions applied on these specific muscle regions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The shear modulus of 13 muscle regions was assessed in stroke patients using elastography. When compared with controls, shear modulus was increased in the gastrocnemius muscle (GM) when the knee was extended and in the soleus (SOL) when the knee was flexed. The distal regions of GM and SOL were the most affected. These changes were consistent in all the stroke patients, suggesting that the regions are a potential source of the increase in joint stiffness.","output":"Effects of stroke injury on the shear modulus of the lower leg muscle during passive dorsiflexion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An escalating pandemic of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health, and effective antivirals are needed. Umifenovir (Arbidol) is an indole-derivative molecule, licensed in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections.

We evaluated the sensitivity of different coronaviruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, to umifenovir using in vitro assays. Using a plaque assay, we revealed an antiviral effect of umifenovir against seasonal HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses in Vero E6 cells, with estimated 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of 10.0  0.5 M and 9.0  0.4 M, respectively.

Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms.

Three findings emerged. First, participants felt that the total institution of prison prepared them for similar experiences such as pandemic-related isolation. Second, shifts in community supervision formatting, such as those forced by the pandemic, lessened the coercive nature of community supervision, expressed by participants as an increase in autonomy. Third, establishment of institutional connections while incarcerated alleviated institutional avoidance resulting from hyper-surveillance, specifically in the domain of healthcare, which is critical when a public health crisis strikes.

We observe that basal spacing is a manifestation of the symmetry of the crystal. Dehydration of nitrate intercalated LDH, which proceeds from an orthorhombic symmetry to a monoclinic symmetry with no decrease in the interlayer spacing, is attributed to sliding of the hydroxyl layers in the ab-plane due to the increase in the ? value. This sliding stabilizes the interlayer through weak long-range electrostatic forces that mainly contribute to the stabilization of the layered structure at separations much larger than the effective radius of hydrogen bonds.

The dog-human coevolutionary process has led to the development of common cognitive abilities and a marked sociability. In this study, performed through a national survey, we investigated the influence of the first lockdown in the human-dog relationship and to what extent the owners were able to perceive the discomfort of their dog. How much could the lockdown affect our dogs emotional states? How do owners rate their dogs quality of life during restrictions? How much did the affectivity and the perception of ones dog as demanding or expensive before and during the lockdown vary in the human-dog relationship? These and other questions were proposed in the survey. The survey analysis highlighted a stability in the interaction and a decrease in the dogs costs perceived by the owners, considering the human-dog relationship. Furthermore, the evaluation of symptoms revealed a moderate percentage increase in anxious behavior in the dog, probably due to the change of routine. Overall, the human sample did not seem particularly worried about any discomfort experienced by their dog during quarantine.

METHOD This retrospective non-interventional observational study of data from the OPAL dataset included patients with AS (ICD code M45, M45.0 or M08.1), aged 18 to 95 years and had completed  1 sleep questionnaire between 1 January 2019 and 30 September 2020. The prevalence of insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Multivariate Apnoea Prediction Index (MAPI), respectively. Propensity score (PS) matching based on sex, age and symptom duration increased comparability between patients administered tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and interleukin 17A inhibitors (IL-17Ai). RESULTS Four hundred ninety-five patients were included. The mean ISI total score in the overall population was 8.6  6.2. Self-reported moderate or severe clinical insomnia was present in 16% and 3.2% of patients, respectively. The mean MAPI score was 0.4  0.3, self-reported apnoea was identified in 31.5% of patients and the mean FACIT-Fatigue score was 36.1  10.7. In the PS matched population, the only treatment-related difference was the mean MAPI score (IL-17Ai 0.4  0.3 and TNFi 0.3  0.2, p = 0.046). Those with poor disease control (BASDAI  4) were more likely (odds ratio [OR] 7.29, 95% CI 2.37 to 22.46, p = 0.001) to have a greater severity of insomnia symptoms than those with good disease control. CONCLUSION In this real-world AS cohort, poor disease control was associated with sleep disturbance. Little difference in sleep disturbance was observed between biologic TNFi and IL-17Ai treatment. Key Points ? Sleep disturbance and fatigue are common in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. ? In our real-world cohort, self-reported apnoea was reported in one-third of patients; and one in five patients reported moderate to severe insomnia. ? Those with poor disease control were more likely to experience greater sleep disturbance than those with good disease control.","output":"Prevalence of sleep disturbance and the association between poor disease control in people with ankylosing spondylitis within the Australian clinical setting (ASLEEP study): a real-world observational study using the OPAL dataset."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have been a public health problem in recent decades and contribute significantly to the clinical and economic burden globally.

However, technological advances have been made and the whole genome sequencing (WGS) method has been shown to be an essential part of routine diagnostics in clinical mycobacteriology laboratories.

A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity. METHODS: We used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically examine associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions. RESULTS: In Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of leading from the front rather than top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of intervention type a leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success.

This novel assay is advantageous over an antiviral assay in providing precise cellular M(Pro) inhibition information to assess an M(Pro) inhibitor. We used this assay to analyze 30 known M(Pro) inhibitors.

Our results also revealed that MPI5, MPI6, MPI7, and MPI8 have high cellular and antiviral potency. As the one with the highest cellular and antiviral potency among all tested compounds, MPI8 has a remarkable cellular M(Pro) inhibition IC(50) value of 31 nM that matches closely to its strong antiviral effect with an EC(50) value of 30 nM.

The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of -oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. OBJECTIVE We further characterize the effect of -rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. METHODS A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to -rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. RESULTS MEP amplitude is modulated by -phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the -rhythm negative peak. CONCLUSION The choice of stimulation intensity influences the observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation by -phase.

The disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Until now, several vaccines and a few drugs have been approved for the prevention and treatment for COVID-19. Recently, the effect of some macrolides including clarithromycin (CAM) on COVID-19 has attracted attention. CAM is known to have diverse effects including immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects, autophagy inhibition, steroid sparing effect, reversibility of drug resistance, antineoplastic effect, antiviral effect as well as bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect. Many patients with COVID-19 died due to an overwhelming response of their own immune system characterized by the uncontrolled release of circulating inflammatory cytokines (cytokine release syndrome [CRS]). This CRS plays a major role in progressing pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. It is noteworthy that CAM can suppress inflammatory cytokines responsible for CRS and also has anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect. Considering the rapidly progressive global disease burden of COVID 19, the application of CAM for treating COVID-19 needs to be urgently evaluated. Recently, an open-labeled non-randomized trial using CAM for treating COVID-19 (ACHIEVE) was initiated in Greece in May, 2020. Its results, though preprint, indicated that CAM treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 was associated with early clinical improvement and containment of viral load.

Currently, measures of precision of regression models' predictions are usually based on the notion of mean error, where by error we mean a deviation of a prediction from an observation. However, these mean based measures of models' performance have two drawbacks. Firstly, they ignore the length of the prediction, which is crucial when dealing with chaotic systems, where a small deviation at the beginning grows exponentially with time. Secondly, these measures are not suitable in situations where a prediction is made for a specific point in time (e.g. a date), since they average all errors from the start of the prediction to its end. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new measure of models' prediction precision, a divergence exponent, based on the notion of the Lyapunov exponent which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed approach enables the measuring and comparison of models' prediction precision for time series with unequal length and a given target date in the framework of chaotic phenomena.

METHODS: It is a prospective cohort investigation of patients who received a response from the Health Centers in the southeast region (RS) of the metropolitan area (AMBA) from April 8 to September 30, 2020. A Situation Room was used epidemiological with two monitoring and follow-up boards, one for bed management and the other for patient management. RESULTS: During the analyzed period, 2,588 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were admitted, 1,943 with suspected COVID-19 pathology, and 1,464 subjects with other pathologies. 55% of the patients were men and the mean age was 51 years. There were 82.8% patients with pre-existing diseases, hypertension and diabetes were the most frequent. 14% were hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit. The mortality of the cohort was 15.05%, mortality was higher for male patients, over 60 years of age, and with the presence of pre-existing diseases. CONCLUSION: Our cohort is younger than other published works. Older people, men, and people with comorbidities are at increased risk for COVID-19-related mortality.

The secondary aim was to explore whether the intervention was associated with clinically significant improvements to clinical and social variables known to co-occur with social anxiety. METHOD: A multidisciplinary team comprising of mental health clinicians, researchers, young adult fiction writers, a comic artist and young people with a lived experience of social anxiety developed the Entourage platform in collaboration. Entourage combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques for social anxiety with an engaging, social-media-based interface that allows users to build social connections, while also receiving expert clinical moderation and support from peer workers. Acceptability, feasibility and safety outcomes of Entourage were tested in a 12-week pilot study with 89 young people (48.3% male; age M = 19.8 years, SD = 3.3 years). Eligible participants were recruited via liaison with four headspace early-intervention centres in north-western Melbourne. RESULTS: 56.8% of the sample reported social anxiety symptoms in the severe or very severe range at baseline. Results demonstrated the Entourage intervention was feasible, safe, and potentially acceptable, with 98.6% of participants reporting they would recommend Entourage to another young person experiencing social anxiety. Usage results were also comparable across male and non-male participants. Results showed that young people reliably and significantly improved on clinical and social variables. In particular, young males showed a clinically significant improvement on social anxiety symptoms (d = 0.79, p < .001), depression (d = 0.71, p < .001), belongingness (d = 0.58, p = .001), increased feelings of social connectedness (d = 0.46, p = .004) and decreased loneliness (d = 0.46, p = .006). Non-male participants also experienced a significant increase in social connectedness (d = 0.76, p < .001), alongside reduced social anxiety (d = 0.78, p < .001) and experiential avoidance (d = 0.81, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Entourage is a highly engaging and potentially effective intervention that represents a novel combination of features designed both to reduce social anxiety symptoms and improve social connection among young people. Entourage demonstrated some acceptability, feasibility and safety, with encouraging benefits to clinical and social variables. Entourage also showed favorable results for the engagement and support of young men with social anxiety symptoms.","output":"Leveraging the social network for treatment of social anxiety: Pilot study of a youth-specific digital intervention with a focus on engagement of young men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Telemedicine has been available for more than 20 years and is playing an increasing role in clinical care However, few studies have evaluated the value of telemedicine in neurosurgical consultations and in guiding neurosurgical care METHODS In this prospective observational study, we examined our experience with emergency video telemedicine consultations for neurosurgical patients at a rural hospital system Our system uses secure and HIPAA-compliant video conferencing to connect providers and patients to a remote neurosurgery consultant, and operates one out of two days RESULTS During a ten-month period, 229 neurosurgical telemedicine consultations were performed Two-thirds of the patients had intracranial pathology, 28% had spinal pathology and 3% of the consults were for patients who returned after care at our institution or required clearance for another procedure Five patients required transfer within the hospital system and 12 out of the hospital system for a higher level of care (total 7 4%) Patients that required transfer most frequently had intracranial pathology (70%) The number of patients transferred out was less than in the year before telemedicine was available CONCLUSION Telemedicine consultation for neurosurgery is feasible for a variety of neurosurgical pathologies, improves patient access to neurosurgery expertise, and facilitates appropriate transfers to a higher level of care when required Our findings are especially relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of delivering quality medical care when physical patient contact is not possible","output":"Feasibility and Value of Telemedicine Neurosurgical Consultations in a Rural Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of some mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can increase the spread and pathogenicity due to the conformational changes and increase the stability of Spike protein.

According to available evidence, the S494P variant is observed in several SARS-CoV-2 strains from Michigan, USA. To investigate how the S494P natural mutation alters receptor binding affinity in RBD, we performed structural analysis of wild-type and mutant spike proteins using some bioinformatics and computational tools. The results show that S494P mutation increases the spike protein stability. Also, applying docking by HADDOCK displayed higher binding affinity to hACE2 for mutant spike than wild type possibly due to the increased -strand and Turn secondary structures which increases surface accessibly surface area (SASA) and chance of interaction.

We discuss the efforts taken by Dr. Minkara and a team of access assistants to develop accessible methods for teaching a largely visual course, including the use of assistive technologies, such as alternative text, braille, and text-to-speech software. Outside perspectives from teaching assistants, access assistants, and students are also discussed. Student feedback was collected in an end-of-term survey and analyzed to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. Evidenced by student feedback on their experience, we demonstrate that Dr. Minkara's visual impairment altered student perceptions about blindness in education and led to a more interactive and engaging learning environment for her students. This evidence also shows that students were overwhelmingly in support of more blind educators in STEM. We present this account and share our developing toolbox to demonstrate that a career in higher education can (and should) be accessible if given the right modifications.

Meeting these responsibilities is critical in the field of global health, where study abroad programs are often designed to provide healthcare services in under-resourced communities. Leaders in global health have thus formed working groups to study the ethical implications of overseas programming and have led the way in establishing socially responsible best practices for study abroad. Their recommendations include development of bidirectional programming that is designed for mutual and equitable benefits, focused on locally identified needs and priorities, attentive to local community costs, and structured to build local capacity to ensure sustainability. Implementation remains a key challenge, however. Sustainable, bidirectional programming is difficult and costly. In the present study, authors questioned how technology could be used to connect students of global health in distant countries to make socially responsible global health programming more accessible. Drawing on empirical research in the learning sciences and leveraging best practices in technology design, the authors developed a Virtual Exchange in Global Health to connect university students in the U.S. with counterparts in Lebanon, who worked in teams to address humanitarian problems in Syrian refugee camps. Early results demonstrate the value of this approach. At dramatically lower cost than traditional study abroad-and with essentially no carbon footprint-students recognized complementary strengths in each other through bidirectional programming, learned about local needs and priorities through Virtual Reality, and built sustaining relationships while addressing a difficult real-world problem. The authors learned that technology could effectively facilitate socially responsible global health programming and do so at low cost.

This could lead to an increase in the fraction and severity of multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates in healthcare facilities, especially in intensive care units (ICU). However, detailed epidemiological investigations, possibly including whole genome sequencing (WGS), are required to confirm the increase in antibiotic resistance and changes, if any, in the population and clonal structures of bacterial pathogens. In this study, we performed a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic characterization of selected multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates obtained from the patients of a dedicated COVID-19 ICU in Moscow, Russia. Hybrid short- and long-read sequencing allowed us to obtain complete profiles of genomic antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants, as well as to reveal the plasmid structure. We demonstrated the genomic similarity in terms of cgMLST profiles of the isolates studied with a clone previously identified in the same facility.

Despite calls from a number of scholars, empirical insights into the complex structural and cultural predictors of why decision aids (DAs) become routinely embedded in health care settings remains limited and highly variable across implementation contexts. METHODS: We examined associations between reach, a widely used indicator (from the RE-AIM model) of implementation success, and multi-level site characteristics of nine LVAD clinics engaged over 18 months in implementation and dissemination of a decision aid for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) treatment. Based on data collected from nurse coordinators, we explored factors at the level of the organization (e.g. patient volume), patient population (e.g. health literacy; average sickness level), clinician characteristics (e.g. attitudes towards decision aid; readiness for change) and process (how the aid was administered). We generated descriptive statistics for each site and calculated zero-order correlations (Pearsons r) between all multi-level site variables including cumulative reach at 12 months and 18 months for all sites. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to examine any latent factors governing relationships between and among all site characteristics, including reach. RESULTS: We observed strongest inclines in reach of our decision aid across the first year, with uptake fluctuating over the second year. Average reach across sites was 63% (s.d. = 19.56) at 12 months and 66% (s.d. = 19.39) at 18 months. Our PCA revealed that site characteristics positively associated with reach on two distinct dimensions, including a first dimension reflecting greater organizational infrastructure and standardization (characteristic of larger, more established clinics) and a second dimension reflecting positive attitudinal orientations, specifically, openness and capacity to give and receive decision support among coordinators and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Successful implementation plans should incorporate specific efforts to promote supportive and mutually informative interactions between clinical staff members and to institute systematic and standardized protocols to enhance the availability, convenience and salience of intervention tool in routine practice.

We performed a quality improvement study to monitor and improve face-mask compliance among healthcare personnel (HCP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in West Haven, Connecticut. PATIENTS: HCP including physicians, nurses, and ancillary staff. METHODS: Face-mask compliance was measured through direct observations during a 4-week baseline period after universal masking was mandated. Frontline and management HCP completed semistructured interviews from which a multimodal intervention was developed. Direct observations were repeated during a 14-week period following implementation of the multimodal intervention. Differences between units were evaluated with &#967;2 testing using the Bonferroni correction. Face-mask compliance between baseline and intervention periods was compared using time-series regression. RESULTS: Among 1,561 observations during the baseline period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 82.2% (range, 80.8%-84.4%). Semistructured interviews were performed with 16 HCP. Qualitative analysis informed the development of a multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership. Among 2,651 observations during the intervention period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 92.6% (range, 84.6%-97.9%).

Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times. One such system, the R-mix? shell vial is discussed herein. The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix? testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix? in a high volume clinical virology laboratory. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed. All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix? shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV. A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made. RESULTS: A total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses. Sensitivity of R-mix? for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days. In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone. CONCLUSIONS: The R-mix? system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1C3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD. Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection.

Implementing a program with national extension to supply hospitals with this blood component is a great challenge mainly in a middle-income economy. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop and implement a Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Program which met established quality standards and was adapted to a reality of limited resources. METHODS: A multicentric convalescent plasma collection program was developed and implemented, based on four main sequential procedures: selective donor recruitment, pre-donation antibody screening (Anti-SARS-CoV-2- Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott), convalescent plasma collection by apheresis or whole-blood processing and distribution to the hospitals according to local demand. RESULTS: From the 572 candidates submitted to the pre-donation antibody screening, only 270 (47%) were considered eligible for plasma donation according to the established criteria. Higher levels of total antibody were associated with the donor age being above 45 years old (p = 0.002), hospital admission (p = 0.018), and a shorter interval between the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and plasma donation (p < 0.001). There was no association between the ABO and Rh blood groups and their antibody levels. Of the 468 donations made, 61% were from the collection of whole-blood and 39%, from apheresis.

Although there are many efficient antiviral agents, they still have drawbacks such as development of virus resistance and accumulation within off-target organs. Encapsulation of antiviral agents into nanoparticles (NPs) has been shown to improve bioavailability, control release, and reduce side effects. However, there is little quantitative understanding of how the uptake of NPs into virally infected cells compares to uninfected cells. In this work, the uptake of fluorescently labeled polymer NPs was investigated in several models of rhinovirus (RV) infected cells. Different multiplicities of RV infections (MOI) and timings of NPs uptake were also investigated. In some cases, RV infection resulted in a significant increase of NPs uptake, but this was not universally noted. For HeLa cells, RV-A16 and RV-A01 infection elevated NPs uptake upon increasing the incubation time, whereas at later timepoints (6 h) a reduced uptake was noted with RV-A01 infection (owing to decreased cell viability). Beas-2B cells exhibited more complex trends: decreases in NPs uptake (cf. uninfected cells) were observed at short incubation times following RV-A01 and RV-A16 infection. At later incubation times (4 h), we found a marked decrease of NPs uptake for RV-A01 infected cells but an increase in uptake with RV-A16 infected cells. Where increases in NPs uptake were found, they were very modest compared to results previously reported for a hepatitis C/ Huh7.5 cell line model. An increase in RV dose (MOI) was not associated with any notable change of NPs uptake. We argue that the diverse endocytic pathways among the different cell lines, together with changes in virus nature, size, and entry mechanism are responsible for these differences. These findings suggest that NPs entry into virally infected cells is a complex process, and further work is required to unravel the different factors which govern this. Undertaking this additional research will be crucial to develop potent nanomedicines for the delivery of antiviral agents.","output":"An investigation of rhinovirus infection on cellular uptake of poly (glycerol-adipate) nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrasonic irradiation of liquids, such as water-alcohol solutions, results in cavitation or the formation of small bubbles. Cavitation bubbles are generated in real solutions without the use of optical traps making our system as close to real conditions as possible. Under the action of the ultrasound, bubbles can grow, oscillate, and eventually, they collapse or decompose. We apply the mathematical method of separation of motions to interpret the acoustic effect on the bubbles. While in most situations, the spherical shape of a bubble is the most energetically profitable as it minimizes the surface energy, when the acoustic frequency is in resonance with the natural frequency of the bubble, shapes with the dihedral symmetry emerge. Some of these resonance shapes turn unstable, so the bubble decomposes. It turns out that bubbles in the solutions of different concentrations (with different surface energies and densities) attain different evolution paths. While it is difficult to obtain a deterministic description of how the solution concentration affects bubble dynamics, it is possible to separate images with different concentrations by applying the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. An ANN was trained to detect the concentration of alcohol in a water solution based on the bubble images.

An underexplored and intriguing property of exercise is its actions on the body's 24 h or circadian rhythms. Molecular clock cells in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) use electrical and chemical signals to orchestrate their activity and convey time of day information to the rest of the brain and body. To date, the long-lasting effects of regular physical exercise on SCN clock cell coordination and communication remain unresolved. Utilizing mouse models in which SCN intercellular neuropeptide signaling is impaired as well as those with intact SCN neurochemical signaling, we examined how daily scheduled voluntary exercise (SVE) influenced behavioral rhythms and SCN molecular and neuronal activities. We show that in mice with disrupted neuropeptide signaling, SVE promotes SCN clock cell synchrony and robust 24 h rhythms in behavior. Interestingly, in both intact and neuropeptide signaling deficient animals, SVE reduces SCN neural activity and alters GABAergic signaling. These findings illustrate the potential utility of regular exercise as a long-lasting and effective non-invasive intervention in the elderly or mentally ill where circadian rhythms can be blunted and poorly aligned to the external world.","output":"Timed daily exercise remodels circadian rhythms in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychiatric-Mental Health nurses can build cultural competence when caring for clients who are Sexual and Gender Minorities (LGBTQIA+) in the following ways: by learning how health care pathologized core aspects of Sexual and Gender Minorities' (SGM) identities; by understanding historical and current SGM minority stressors and consequent health disparities and inequities; and by framing health disparities and inequities as forms of cultural violence.

Several recent studies have reported elevated aPTT in COVID-19 patients with a thrombotic tendency, suggesting that the test results may be due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA). LA, one of the antiphospholipid antibodies, is included in the diagnostic criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and these syndromes are characterized by a tendency to thrombosis, so it is important to ascertain the meaning of LA in SARS-COV-2 infection. Here, we would like to investigate the changes in LA and the characteristics of coagulation-related factors in COVID-19 patients who have undergone LA testing. Methods: From March 2020 to June 2021, we conducted a medical record review of clinical information and laboratory data for COVID-19 patients at our hospital. Among the 140 confirmed patients, 110 patients who underwent lupus anticoagulant testing were included in the analysis. We also performed a subgroup analysis of COVID-19 patients who were regularly screened for LA. Results: Most of the patients in our study were mild, with 95 survivors except for the deaths of 15 patients. Lupus anticoagulant was identified in 71.6% of survivors and 40.0% of deaths. In the LA confirmatory test of survivors, DRVVT positive 98.5% and SCT positive 5.9% were found (Fig 1). When comparing coagulation parameters according to LA results in survivors, aPTT, CRP, and fibrinogen were found to be statistically significant (all P < 0.05). LA-positive patients had higher aPTT, CRP, and fibrinogen, and D-dimer was no different from LA-negative patients (Table 1). Of the 67 LA-positive patients, 25 patients did not follow up, and 12 patients were unable to clearly determine the duration of the negative transition. Among the 30 patients who underwent a follow-up LA test, short-term regular follow-up of LA testing was performed on patients from March 2021 to June 2021, and additional subgroup analysis was performed on these patients. All patients were confirmed to be DRVVT positive and had no other anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)-related antibodies, such as anti-cardiolipin antibodies or anti-beta-2-gylcoprotein. LA disappeared rapidly within 4 weeks in all patients (range: 2-24 days). As the LA test result converted from positive to negative, aPTT decreased with a statistically significant difference (P=0.003, Fig 2). Conclusions: As previously reported, LA was found in a high proportion of COVID-19 patients. This is the first study to confirm that the proportion of LA positivity (71.6%) is high in Korean COVID-19 patients. Most of the LA positivity disappeared within 4 weeks instead of 12 weeks. The association between LA and thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 patients appears to be low. Presumably, the transient appearance of LA, which is rapidly disappearance in survivors at a high rate, may indicate that other autoantibodies due to the activation of the immune response were detected in the LA test, can be considered as a good indicator of prognosis. It is only necessary to note that there is no delay in anticoagulant treatment due to aPTT prolongation in the early stage due to LA. In summary, the clinical significance of high LA positive rates and rapid negative transitions in COVID-19 patients is currently unknown but needs confirmation.

While the morphological, molecular, and genetic pathways leading to OA have been examined extensively; the effects of these injuries on joint kinematics, and thus disease progression, have yet to be fully characterized. To this end, we sought to understand the kinematics in the DMM and ACLT joints compared to intact joints subjected to controlled tibial compressive loading. We hypothesized that the DMM and ACLT models would result in different patterns of joint instability compared to intact joints, thus explaining the different patterns of OA initiation and severity in these models. Cadaver adult C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either a DMM or ACLT in their right knee joints, while the left limbs remained as intact controls. All limbs were labeled with fiducial markers, and the rigid body kinematics of the tibia and femur were examined using roentgen stereophotogrammetry (RSA) with application of compressive loads from 0 to 9 N. DMM and intact joints demonstrated similar kinematics under compressive loading, in contrast to ACLT joints, which dislocated even before load application. These results demonstrate the importance of rigorous kinematic analysis in defining the role of joint instability in animal models of OA and suggest significant differences in DMM and ACLT joint instabilities in the context of controlled mechanical loading. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Feed samples were spiked with PEDV and then heated to 120C145C for up to 30 min or irradiated at 0C50 kGy. Another set of feed samples spiked with PEDV and mixed with Ultracid P (Nutriad), Activate DA (Novus International), KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifood), Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition), sugar or salt was incubated at room temperature (~25C) for up to 21 days. At the end of incubation, the virus titers were determined by inoculation of Vero-81 cells and the virus inactivation kinetics were modeled using the Weibull distribution model. The Weibull kinetic parameter delta represented the time or eBeam dose required to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For thermal processing, delta values ranged from 16.52 min at 120C to 1.30 min at 145C. For eBeam processing, a target dose of 50 kGy reduced PEDV concentration by 3 log. All additives tested were effective in reducing the survival of PEDV when compared with the control sample (delta = 17.23 days). Activate DA (0.81) and KEM-GEST (3.28) produced the fastest inactivation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among undergraduate students and their relationships with social networking sites usage during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online survey was used to recruit 456 participants for this cross-sectional descriptive study. Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data on students' demographics, depression, anxiety, stress, and social networking usage. The results revealed that the majority of students had symptoms of depression (74.1%), anxiety (59.6%), and stress (61.2%). Female students had higher depression and anxiety symptoms than males. Senior-level students' psychological distress symptoms were significantly different from those of junior level. The largest percentage of students (91.9%) used social networking sites for entertainment. The academic usage of social networking sites was negatively (p < .05) correlated with depression and stress scores, while entertainment usage was positively correlated with anxiety. Age was not found to be significantly correlated with psychological distress. Academic and entertainment use of social networking sites were successfully associated with psychological distress symptoms after controlling for demographics. During this unprecedented time of undergraduate students course of study, they were experiencing higher than average distress symptoms. These symptoms could be mitigated by continuing the regular academic activities and delivering the most accurate up-to-date information on the COVID-19 through social networking sites.","output":"The relationship between social networking sites usage and psychological distress among undergraduate students during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weight loss is key to controlling the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components, i.e., central obesity, hypertension, prediabetes and dyslipidaemia. The goals of our study were two-fold. First, we characterised the relationships between eating duration, unprocessed and processed food consumption and metabolic health. During 4 weeks of observation, 213 adults used a smartphone application to record food and drink consumption, which was annotated for food processing levels following the NOVA classification. Low consumption of unprocessed food and low physical activity showed significant associations with multiple MS components. Second, in a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we compared the metabolic benefits of 12 h time-restricted eating (TRE) to standard dietary advice (SDA) in 54 adults with an eating duration > 14 h and at least one MS component. After 6 months, those randomised to TRE lost 1.6% of initial body weight (SD 2.9, p = 0.01), compared to the absence of weight loss with SDA (?1.1%, SD 3.5, p = 0.19). There was no significant difference in weight loss between TRE and SDA (between-group difference ?0.88%, 95% confidence interval ?3.1 to 1.3, p = 0.43). Our results show the potential of smartphone records to predict metabolic health and highlight that further research is needed to improve individual responses to TRE such as a shorter eating window or its actual clock time.","output":"The Effects of Time-Restricted Eating versus Standard Dietary Advice on Weight, Metabolic Health and the Consumption of Processed Food: A Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial in Community-Based Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present a similar syndrome to an influenza infection, which may complicate diagnosis and clinical management of these two important respiratory infectious diseases, especially during the peak season of influenza. A rapid and convenient point-of-care test (POCT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is of great importance for prompt and efficient control of these respiratory epidemics. Herein, a multichannel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform was developed based on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) array for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1). The developed MEIA was constructed with eight channels and allowed rapid detection on a single array. On the SPCE surface, monoclonal antibodies against influenza A(H1N1) hemagglutinin (HA) protein or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were coated to capture the target antigens, which then interacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody to form an immuno-sandwich complex. The results showed that the MEIA exhibited a broader linear range than ELISA and comparable sensitivity for A(H1N1) HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The detection results on 79 clinical samples for A(H1N1) suggested that the proposed MEIA platform showed comparable results with ELISA in sensitivity (with a positive rate of 100% for positive samples) but higher specificity, with a false-positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples versus that of 40.5% with ELISA. Thus, it offers great potential for the on-the-spot differential diagnosis of infected patients, which would significantly benefit the efficient control and prevent the spread of these infectious diseases in communities or resource-limited regions in the future.","output":"Multichannel Immunosensor Platform for the Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinct SARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/or vaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediated response is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responses against SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2{delta} and SARS-CoV-2o pseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories, including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2{delta}, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, the variant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and that individuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposure exhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that the interplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape the antigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future vaccine design. Author SummaryNeutralising antibodies provide protection against viruses and are generated because of vaccination or prior infections. The main target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies is a protein called Spike, which decorates the viral particle and mediates viral entry into cells. As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, mutations accumulate in the spike protein, allowing the virus to escape antibody-mediated immunity and decreasing vaccine effectiveness. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants have appeared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing various waves of infection through the population and infecting-in some cases-people that had been previously infected or vaccinated. Since the antibody response is highly specific, individuals infected with different variants are likely to have different repertoires of neutralising antibodies. We studied the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants using sera from vaccinated people as well as from people infected with different variants. We show that potency of the antibody response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants depends on the particular variant that infected each person, the exposure type (infection or vaccination) and the number and order of exposures. Our study provides insight into the interplay between virus evolution and immunity, as well as important information for the development of better vaccination strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth and potency of antibody-mediated immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease potentially leading to long lasting respiratory symptoms and has resulted in over 4 million deaths worldwide.

In recent years, behavioural economic principles have been used to design novel interventions that increase physical activity. Immediate financial rewards, for instance, can motivate an individual to change physical activity behaviour by lowering the opportunity costs of exercise. This systematic review will summarise the evidence about the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions for improving physical activity in adults. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EconLit, SPORTDiscus, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception using a comprehensive, electronic search strategy. The search strategy will include terms related to 'financial incentive' and 'physical activity'. Only randomised controlled trials that investigate the effect of financial incentives on physical activity in adult populations and that are written in the English language will be included. Two review authors will independently screen abstracts and titles, complete full text reviews and extract data on objective and self-reported physical activity outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and associated cases reported in Ontario between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. All outbreaks were manually classified into two-digit North American Industry Classification System codes. We obtained monthly denominator estimates from the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey to estimate the incidence of outbreak-associated cases per 100 000 000 hours among individuals who reported the majority of hours were worked outside the home. We performed this analysis across industries and in three distinct time periods. RESULTS: Overall, 12% of cases were attributed to workplace outbreaks among working-age adults across our study period. While incidence varied across the time periods, the five industries with the highest incidence rates across our study period were agriculture, healthcare and social assistance, food manufacturing, educational services, and transportation and warehousing.

Although both types of learning have their place in an educational system it is important to be able to distinguish between these two approaches to learning and identify options which can dislodge students from rote learning and motivate them towards meaningful learning. The tutor-web is an online drilling system. The design aim of the system is learning rather than evaluation. This is done by presenting students with multiple-choice questions which are selected randomly but linked to the students' performance. The questions themselves can be generated for a specific topic by drawing correct and incorrect answers from a collection associated with a general problem statement or heading. With this generating process students may see the same question heading twice but be presented with all new answer options or a mixture of new and old answer options. Data from a course on probability theory and statistics, taught during COVID-19, are analysed to separate rote learning from meaningful learning. The analyses show non-rote learning, but even with large question databases, students' performance is better when they are presented with an answer option they have seen before. An element of rote learning is thus exhibited but a deeper learning is also demonstrated. The item database has been seeded with hints such that some questions contain clues to cue the students towards the correct answer. This ties in with the issue of meaningful learning versus rote learning since the hope is that a new hint will work as a cue to coax the student to think harder about the question rather than continue to employ rote learning. Preliminary results indicate that hints are particularly useful for students with poor performance metrics.","output":"Identifying rote learning and the supporting effects of hints in drills"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the extensive long-term care services for older people, the Nordic countries have been labelled caring states as reported (Leira, Welfare state and working mothers: the Scandinavian experience, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992). The emphasis on services and not cash benefits ensures the Nordics a central place in the public service model (Anttonen and Sipil?, J Eur Soc Policy 6:87C100, 1996). The main feature of this ideal model is public social care services, such as home care and residential care services, which can cover the need for personal and medical care, as well as assistance with household chores. These services are provided within a formally and professionally based long-term care system, where the main responsibility for the organization, provision and financing of care traditionally lays with the public sector. According to the principle of universalism (in: Antonnen et al. (eds), Welfare state, universalism and diversity, Elgar, Cheltenham, 2013), access to benefits such as home care and residential care is based on citizenship and need, not contributions nor merit. Also, care services should be made available for all and generally be used by all, with no stigma associated. Vab? and Szebehely (in: Anttonen (ed), Welfare State, universalism and diversity, Edward Elgar Publishing, London, 2012)) further argue that the Nordic service universalism is more than merely issues of eligibility and accessibility, in that it also encompasses whether services are attractive, affordable and flexible in order to meet a diversity of needs and preferences. However, recent decades have seen a continuous tendency towards prioritization of care for the most frail, contributing to unmet need, informalization of care and privatization in the use of topping up with market-based services. These changes have raised questions about increasing inequalities within Nordic long-term care systems. We investigate in the article what effect changes have for equality across social class and gender, for users and informal carers.

Large sets are more expensive, take longer preparation time due to instrument counting and as a consequence take more total operating time. Furthermore, more instruments need to be unnecessarily purchased, stored and cleaned post procedure. Simple paediatric plastic surgery procedures including nailbed repair or laceration repair require limited and largely replicating operative instrument set. We have therefore introduced Small Minor Plastic Surgical set (MS) containing only 10 instruments. We audited its effectiveness and introduced a revised version of the set as per feedback, permanently arranged into theatre operative set collection. METHODS: MS set was introduced and used at senior surgeons discursion for paediatric plastic surgical procedures. Feedback was gathered from the surgeon and scrub nurse via specially designed questionnaire at post operation and theatre team debrief. Suggested alterations were implemented and New Minor Surgical (NMS) set was introduced and re-audited using revised questionnaire. RESULTS: 61% of surgeons and 89% of scrub personnel thought MS set contained everything that was needed for the case. Following revision 91% of surgeons and 95% of scrub nurses thought NMS set contained all necessary equipment for the operation.

Human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to infect people via binding to spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 4 post-transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at days 3, 6, and 12 post-infection compared to Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in interferon-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T cell populations including Cd3g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several KEGG pathways were enriched in the dataset, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of COVID-19 patients. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.

The world is experiencing a major demographic shift towards an older, obese, and physically inactive populace. Risk factor assessments based on pandemic data indicate that those at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include older males, and people of all ages with obesity and related comorbidities such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Aging in and of itself leads to negative changes in innate and adaptive immunity, a process termed immunosenescence. Obesity causes systemic inflammation and adversely impacts immune function and host defense in a way that patterns immunosenescence. Two primary prevention strategies to reduce the risk for COVID-19 at both the community and individual level include mitigation activities and the adoption of lifestyle practices consistent with good immune health. Animal and human studies support the idea that, in contrast to high exercise workloads, regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves immunosurveillance against pathogens and reduces morbidity and mortality from viral infection and respiratory illnesses including the common cold, pneumonia, and influenza. The odds are high that infectious disease pandemics spawned by novel pathogens will continue to inflict morbidity and mortality as the world's population becomes older and more obese. COVID-19 is indeed a wake-up call, a tocsin, to the world that primary prevention countermeasures focused on health behaviors and hygiene demand our full attention and support.","output":"COVID-19: A tocsin to our aging, unfit, corpulent, and immunodeficient society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mark Foster discusses a newly released report","output":"Safeguarding pressures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several cases of pigmented mammary Paget's disease (PMPD) mimicking cutaneous malignant melanoma have been reported.

While the cause of these disparities is multifactorial, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the structural barriers to health and health care and the gaps in public health infrastructure within the United States. The most long-standing inequities are rooted in discriminatory practices, current and historical, which have excluded and disenfranchised many of the most vulnerable populations in the nation. These systemic barriers are themselves a public health crisis, resulting in increased mortality rates in communities of color from both COVID-19 and cancer. While implementing programs to temporarily improve cancer equity locally or regionally is laudable, it is imperative to develop a public health strategy focused on alleviating the root causes of health inequities to improve the health and well-being of every citizen and ensure readiness for the next public health emergency.","output":"Improving Equity in Cancer Care in the Face of a Public Health Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers. Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 x 109/L and 1.04 x 109/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.

METHODS: Loss of sense of smell and/or taste was reported by 26 of 63 COVID-19 patients (41%), whereas only 31% of the patients experiencing hyposmia had simultaneous symptoms of rhinitis. Smell tests were performed in 14 of these patients and taste tests in 10. The measurements were conducted in a patient care setting in an early COVID-19 cohort. RESULTS: An olfactory disorder was present in 10/14 patients, before as well as after nasal decongestion. In 2 of these patients, hyposmia was the leading or only symptom of SARS-CoV?2 infection. All tested patients reported recovery of smell and/or taste within 8 to 23 days. CONCLUSION: The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1C3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. There were no indications of an increased incidence of dysgeusia. These early data may help in the interpretation of COVID-19-associated hyposmia as well as in the counseling of patients, given the temporary nature of hyposmia observed in this study. Furthermore, according to the current experience, hyposmia without rhinitic obstruction can be the leading or even the only symptom of a SARS-CoV?2 infection.","output":"Tempor?re Hyposmie bei COVID-19-Patienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The flexible capacitive pressure sensors are one of the most essential and famous devices with vast applications in automobile, aerospace, marine, healthcare, wearables, consumer, and portable electronics. The fabrication of pressure sensors in a cleanroom is expensive and time-consuming; however, the sensitivity, linearity, and other performance factors of those pressure sensors are exceptional. Moreover, sometimes we require sensors that are not expensive and can be fabricated rapidly where the other performance factors do not need to be highly remarkable. In this modern era, household materials and DIY (Do-it-yourself) techniques are quite helpful, highly utilized. They are recommended to fabricate low-cost sensors and healthcare devices for personalized medicine and low-cost consumer electronics. Different flexible capacitive pressure sensors are presented and experimentally characterized for acoustic and air-pressure monitoring in this thesis. The design criteria of a cantilever-based capacitive pressure sensor are discussed. The three different designs are analysed with aspect ratios of 1.5, 1.0, and 0.67. The sensor with an aspect ratio of 0.67 shows maximum sensitivity (mechanical and electrical), better response time, and the 1st and 2nd mode of resonant frequencies is comparatively less than the other two. The cantilever designs are susceptible to slight pressure; therefore, the diaphragm-based normal mode capacitive pressure sensor is introduced in the second chapter, which defines the design criteria of diaphragm shapes. The five different diaphragms analysed are circular, elliptical, pentagon, square, and rectangular shapes.

The authors have limited knowledge of its impact on mental health. The present study aimed to examine the level and extent of psychological distress of SARS survivors following 1-month recovery, to explore patients' negative appraisals of the impact of SARS, and to evaluate the associations between psychological distress and negative appraisals. METHOD The Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and a newly developed measure, the SARS Impact Scale (SIS), were mailed to 453 Hong Kong Chinese SARS survivors discharged from hospital for 4 weeks or more. RESULTS A total of 425 patients received the questionnaires and 180 (mean age 36.9 years; 120 women) gave valid replies. The response rate was 42.4 %. The participants also represented 13.6 % of all adult survivors in Hong Kong. About 35 % of respondents reported 'moderate to severe' or 'severe' ranges of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. It was found that those working as healthcare workers or having family members killed by SARS were more prone to develop subsequent high levels of distress. Factor analyses extracted three meaningful factors of the SIS, namely 'survival threat', 'physical impact', and 'social impact'. Negative appraisals at the acute phase and 1-month recovery significantly accounted for substantial portions of variances for anxiety and depressive symptoms, after the effects of other psychosocial variables were controlled. CONCLUSIONS Psychological distress of SARS survivors at 1-month recovery is real and significant. Negative appraisals may play a pivotal role in the development of psychological distress for SARS survivors, at least in the short term.","output":"Psychological distress and negative appraisals in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has stretched ICU resources in an unprecedented fashion and outstripped personal protective equipment supplies. The combination of a novel disease, resource limitations, and risks to medical personnel health have created new barriers to implementing the ICU Liberation (A for Assessment, Prevention, and Manage pain; B for Both Spontaneous Awakening Trials and Spontaneous Breathing Trials; C for Choice of Analgesia and Sedation; D for Delirium Assess, Prevent, and Manage; E for Early Mobility and Exercise; and F for Family Engagement and Empowerment [ABCDEF]) Bundle, a proven ICU care approach that reduces delirium, shortens mechanical ventilation duration, prevents post-ICU syndrome, and reduces healthcare costs. This narrative review acknowledges barriers and offers strategies to optimize Bundle performance in coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA EXTRACTION: The most relevant literature, media reports, and author experiences were assessed for inclusion in this narrative review including PubMed, national newspapers, and critical care/pharmacology textbooks. DATA SYNTHESIS: Uncertainty regarding coronavirus disease 2019 clinical course, shifts in attitude, and changes in routine behavior have hindered Bundle use. A domino effect results from: 1) changes to critical care hierarchy, priorities, and ICU team composition; 2) significant personal protective equipment shortages cause; 3) reduced/restricted physical bedside presence favoring; 4) increased depth of sedation and use of neuromuscular blockade; 5) which exacerbate drug shortages; and 6) which require prolonged use of limited ventilator resources. Other identified barriers include manageable knowledge deficits among non-ICU clinicians unfamiliar with the Bundle or among PICU specialists deploying pediatric-based Bundle approaches who are unfamiliar with adult medicine. Both groups have been enlisted to augment the adult ICU work force to meet demand. Strategies were identified to facilitate Bundle performance to liberate patients from the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We acknowledge current challenges that interfere with comprehensive management of critically ill patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Rapid response to new circumstances precisely requires established safety mechanisms and protocols like the ABCDEF Bundle to increase ICU and ventilator capacity and help survivors maximize recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 as early as possible.","output":"Strategies to Optimize ICU Liberation (A to F) Bundle Performance in Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Size- and time-dependent particle removal efficiency (PRE) of different protective respiratory masks were determined using a standard aerosol powder with the size of particles in the range of an uncoated SARS-CoV-2 virus and small respiratory droplets.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 164 emergency surgery patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1, 2020, to January 20, 2020. For this report, the final date of follow-up was February 5, 2020. The associated clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, demographic, radiologic, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 164 emergency surgery patients, the median age was 41 years (interquartile range, 29-89), and 136 (82.9%) were women. The associated main clinical symptom included fever (93 [56.7%])dry cough (56 [34.2%]), fatigue (86 [52.4%]), nausea (78 [47.6%]), and dizziness (77 [47%]). Of 54 emergency surgery patients infected with COVID-19, the median age was 46 years (interquartile range: 25-89), and 45 (83.3%) were women. The pathologic clinical symptoms investigated included fever (54 [100%]), fatigue (48 [88.9%]), nausea (52 [96.3%]), dizziness (46 [85.2%]), and dry cough (44 [81.5%]). The lymphopenia (0.37  109/L [interquartile range: 0.23-0.65]) and increased C-reactive protein (24.7  109/L [interquartile range: 13.57-38]) were observed. The preoperative fever and postoperative fever in emergency surgery patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this study. Of 54 emergency surgery patients with COVID-19, 15 (27.8%) showed preoperative fever, 54 (100%) had postoperative fever. Of 110 emergency surgery patients without COVID-19, 5 (4.5%) had preoperative fever, 31 (28.2%) patients had postoperative fever.

Results: We found that statistically significant differences among the Covid-19 perceptions of individuals. The effect size showed that this difference is at a large level. As the variances did not evenly distribute, the Dunnett C multiple comparison tests were applied. According to this, the highest mean in Georgia and India, the lowest mean in Germany and the USA. Conclusion: The majority have the national and international awareness required to cope with the pandemic. However, the source of the virus has still not been explained so it has been observed that the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories is also high. As a result, people need more reliable sources of information, especially the World Health Organization should make more precise explanations to people about the origin of Covid-19 and updated information should be made available to people constantly. In addition, although a long time passed after the appearance of the Covid-19, people are still confused.

Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of mortality, morbidity, admission of Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and severe COVID-19. Results: Nine studies were included in meta-analysis with 6 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 3 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (obese and non-obese). Most studies were conducted in China (55.5%) with remaining studies from French, Germany, and United States (US). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 0.55 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.07-1.03, P=0.02). BMI [a?]30 (obese) was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.06-3.34, P=0.03). Multivariate meta-regression analysis by including three moderators: age, hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) showed the association between obesity and composite poor outcome was affected by age with regression coefficient =-0.06 and P=0.02. Subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies for several outcomes. Conclusion: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.

Inhalable vaccines have the potential to address these distribution and compliance issues as they are less likely to require cold storage, avoid the use of needles, and can elicit potent localized immune responses with only a single dose. Alveolar macrophages represent attractive targets for inhalable vaccines as they are abundant within lung mucosa (90-95% of all immune cells), are important mediators of mucosal immunity, and evidence suggests may be key cellular players in early Covid-19 pathogenesis. Here, we report inhalable coronavirus mimetic particles (CoMiP) designed to rapidly bind to, and be internalized by, alveolar macrophages to deliver nucleic acid encoded viral antigens. Inspired by the SARS-CoV-2 virion structure, CoMiPs package nucleic acid cargo within an endosomolytic peptide envelope that is wrapped in a macrophage-targeting glycosaminoglycan coating. Through this design, CoMiP carriers mimic several important features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion, particularly surface topography and macromolecular chemistry. As a result, CoMiPs effect pleiotropic transfection of macrophage and lung epithelial cells in vitro with multiple antigen-encoding plasmids. In vivo immunization yields increased mucosal IgA levels within the respiratory tract of CoMIP vaccinated mice.Funding: Funding for this work was provided by the COVID Research Seed Fund from the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences and Materials Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University.Declaration of Interests: None to declare.

This stems in large part from the inseparable, high-contact nature of many services. During a pandemic, multiple forms of contact C customer-to-customer, customer-to-employee, employee-to-employee, and customer/employee-to-air/surfaces C can lead to serious illness or death. The urgent need for increased separability and decreased contact have led to a wave of service adaptations (firms efforts to improve safety) and service transformations (innovations that bolster safety while offering additional benefits that are superior to what existed previously). COVID-19 has made service safety paramount, with most attention being paid to minimizing disease transmission. However, safety needs in a pandemic extend beyond physical to include interrelated domains of emotional, financial, and information safety. Physical safety is the absence of harm or injury. Emotional safety is relief from mental distress arising from pandemic-related personal traumas. Financial safety concerns minimizing economic insecurity related to the pandemic. Information safety refers to peoples sense of confidence that they have the information they need to make good decisions, information that is trustworthy. We describe the unique service transformations addressing these safety concerns of Hong Kong International Airport, Henry Ford Health System (Detroit), Innocent Bystander (Australia), and Service Now that are likely to continue after the pandemic has passed.

However, the incidences of kidney abnormalities were significantly different, from 0.5 to 75.4% in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The association of kidney injury with prognosis remain controversial. Methods: : In this retrospective cohort study, laboratory confirmedCOVID-19inpatients with severe type were enrolled. Demographic, clinicaland laboratory data were collected. Association of estimated glomerular fifiltration rate (eGFR)with 28-days mortality was analyzed. Results: : The total 28-days mortality of hospitalizationwas 22.3% (79/354). Non-survivors had a significantly declined eGFR levels than survivors (75.95 [IQR: 47.22,92.84] ml/min/1.73m 2 vs. 96.43 [IQR: 84.11,108.47] ml/min/1.73m 2 , P <0.001). The 28-days mortality in declined eGFR group (<90 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) was significantly higher than that in normal eGFR group (38.5% vs. 10.7%, P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the independent risk factors of 28-days outcome included lower eGFR (OR: 3.97, 95%CI: 1.42-11.11), elevated WBC (OR: 7.08, 95%CI: 3.15-15.90), lymphopenia (OR: 2.58, 95%CI: 1.21-5.49)andIL-6 (OR: 7.90, 95%CI: 2.19-28.49).

We used a microsimulation model to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccination program in South Africa. We varied vaccination coverage, pace, acceptance, effectiveness, and cost as well as epidemic dynamics. Providing vaccine to at least 40% of the population and prioritizing accelerated vaccine rollout prevented >9 million infections and >73,000 deaths and reduced costs due to fewer hospitalizations. Further, the vaccination program was cost-saving even at the lowest examined levels of acceptance (50%), effectiveness against infection (20%), effectiveness against symptomatic disease (30%), and effectiveness against severe/critical disease requiring hospitalization (40%), and with vaccination costs of up to USD25/person. In summary, a COVID-19 vaccination program would reduce both deaths and health care costs in South Africa across a wide range of assumptions.

The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","output":"What Happened to Patients With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

He is a 37-year old Latin-American male who had been treated with radiation, CyBorD regimen, AHCT and bortezomib therapy before being referred to our service. It was decided to administer daratumumab therapy and subsequently perform the transplant. Placement of central venous access, fluid infusion, conditioning regimen with melphalan and previously cryopreserved autograft infusion were carried out in an outpatient basis. Following second AHCT, the patient demonstrated clinical, VEGF, hematological response and remains SARS-CoV-2 infection-free and in POEMS remission with excellent quality-of-life at last follow up (6 months). We evidenced that thanks to an outpatient transplant program, the best therapeutic modalities can be offered to patients with hematologic malignancies in the context of present or future pandemics. Finally, high-complexity patients with HIV infection should have access to the same treatment strategies as non-infected patients. A second AHCT in the outpatient setting is feasible, safe and highly effective to treat patients with relapsed POEMS syndrome.","output":"Successful second outpatient autologous hematopoietic cell transplant for relapsed POEMS syndrome in a patient with coexisting HIV, HBV and syphilis infections during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) represents the second most common neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of dance therapy (DT) aimed at improving non-motor symptoms in PD. METHODS: Studies were performed through PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and Science Direct from inception to October 27, 2021. The data were screened independently by two reviewers, and the quality of the papers was assessed using the Cochrane manual. The included studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials, reporting random-effects standardized mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals as the effect size. I2 statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. The main outcomes included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA), Baker Depression Scale (BDI), Parkinson's Fatigue Scale (FPS-16), and Apathy Scale (AS). RevMan 5.3 software was integrated for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine literatures were analyzed for the meta-analysis with a total of 307 patients. Random effects showed that DT significantly improved cognitive of PD (MD = 1.50, 95% CI [0.52, 2.48], P = 0.0003; I2 = 51%). However, this meta-analysis demonstrated that dance therapy had no significance for improving depression (MD = - 1.33, 95% CI [- 4.11, 1.45], P = 0.35; I2 = 79%), fatigue (MD = 0.26, 95% CI [- 0.31, 0.83], P = 0.37; I2 = 0%), and apathy (MD = 0.07, 95% CI [- 2.55, 2.69], P = 0.96; I2 = 50%).

However, a major issue when using compartmental mathematical models concerns the time-invariant formulation of hyper-parameters that prevent the model from following the evolution over time of the epidemiological phenomenon under investigation. In order to cope with this problem, the present work suggests an alternative hybrid approach based on Machine Learning that avoids recalculation of hyper-parameters and only uses an initial set. This study shows that the proposed hybrid approach makes it possible to correct the expected loss of accuracy observed in the compartmental model when the considered time horizon increases. As a case study, a basic compartmental model has been designed and tested to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations during the first and the second pandemic waves in Lombardy, Italy. The model is based on an extended formulation of the contact function that allows modelling of the trend of personal contacts throughout the reference period. Moreover, the scenario analysis proposed in this work can help policy-makers select the most appropriate containment measures to reduce hospitalizations and relieve pressure on the health system, but also to limit any negative impact on the economic and social systems.","output":"Limits of Compartmental Models and New Opportunities for Machine Learning: A Case Study to Forecast the Second Wave of COVID-19 Hospitalizations in Lombardy, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection and growth are dependent on initiating signaling and enzyme actions upon viral entry into the host cell. Proteins packaged during virus assembly may subsequently form the first line of attack and host manipulation upon infection. A complete characterization of virion components is therefore important to understanding the dynamics of early stages of infection. Mass spectrometry and kinase profiling techniques identified nearly 200 incorporated host and viral proteins. We used published interaction data to identify hubs of connectivity with potential significance for virion formation. Surprisingly, the hub with the most potential connections was not the viral M protein but the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), which is one of the novel virion components identified by mass spectrometry. Based on new experimental data and a bioinformatics analysis across the Coronaviridae, we propose a higher-resolution functional domain architecture for nsp3 that determines the interaction capacity of this protein. Using recombinant protein domains expressed in Escherichia coli, we identified two additional RNA-binding domains of nsp3. One of these domains is located within the previously described SARS-unique domain, and there is a nucleic acid chaperone-like domain located immediately downstream of the papain-like proteinase domain. We also identified a novel cysteine-coordinated metal ion-binding domain. Analyses of interdomain interactions and provisional functional annotation of the remaining, so-far-uncharacterized domains are presented. Overall, the ensemble of data surveyed here paint a more complete picture of nsp3 as a conserved component of the viral protein processing machinery, which is intimately associated with viral RNA in its role as a virion component.","output":"Proteomics analysis unravels the functional repertoire of coronavirus nonstructural protein 3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paramyxoviruses (some of which are also called parainfluenza viruses) cause a wide variety of diseases in animals.

Several of the most devastating diseases of animals, such as rinderpest, Newcastle disease, and canine distemper, are caused by paramyxoviruses. Some of the animal paramyxoviruses, such as the Hendra and Nipah viruses, are emerging zoonotic pathogens of major public health concern.

The members of this virus family are enveloped and have genomes consisting of a single segment of negative-sense RNA that contains 6C10 genes encoding up to 12 proteins. Although there are many animal paramyxoviruses, only a few effective vaccines are currently available. In the last decade, methods of producing many animal paramyxoviruses entirely from cDNA clones (reverse genetics) have been developed.

Previous research has provided evidence for an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In Germany, however, only scarce data on correlates and predictors for PTSD symptomatology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCW) are available. Methods: This research is part of a large prospective web-based survey (egePan-VOICE study) among HCW in Germany. The current sample (N = 4,724) consisted of physicians (n = 1,575), nurses (n = 1,277), medical technical assistants (MTA, n = 1,662), and psychologists (n = 210). PTSD symptomatology was measured using the abbreviated version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6). In addition, sociodemographic, occupational, COVID-19-related, psychological (e.g., depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety), as well as work-related variables were assessed. Results: Our findings revealed significant higher PTSD symptoms with medium effect sizes among HCW reporting an increased self-report burden during the pandemic, increased fear of becoming infected or infecting relatives with the virus, sleep problems, feeling physically or mentally exhausted, as well as increased levels of depressiveness and generalized anxiety. According to multiple linear regression analysis, the most relevant predictors for higher IES-6 scores were increased level of generalized anxiety and depressiveness, increased fear of infecting relatives, as well as medical profession (MTA compared to physicians).

There is substantial variation in the degree to which different parts of England areas were exposed - by chance - to delayed referrals of COVID-19 cases to to the contact tracing system. We show that more affected areas subsequently experienced a drastic rise in new COVID-19 infections and deaths alongside an increase in the positivity rate and the number of test performed, as well as a decline in the performance of the contact tracing system. Conservative estimates suggest that the failure of timely contact tracing due to the data glitch is associated with more than 125,000 additional infections and over 1,500 additional COVID-19-related deaths.

MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","output":"Acceptability of no-test medical abortion provided via telemedicine during Covid-19: analysis of patient-reported outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and is still posing a severe health risk to the public. Accurate and efficient segmentation of pneumonia lesions in CT scans is vital for treatment decision-making. We proposed a novel unsupervised approach using cycle consistent generative adversarial network (cycle-GAN) which automates and accelerates the process of lesion delineation. The workflow includes lung volume segmentation,\\"synthetic\\"healthy lung generation, infected and healthy image subtraction, and binary lesion mask creation. The lung volume volume was firstly delineated using a pre-trained U-net and worked as the input for the later network. The cycle-GAN was developed to generate synthetic\\"healthy\\"lung CT images from infected lung images. After that, the pneumonia lesions are extracted by subtracting the synthetic\\"healthy\\"lung CT images from the\\"infected\\"lung CT images. A median filter and K-means clustering were then applied to contour the lesions. The auto segmentation approach was validated on two public datasets (Coronacases and Radiopedia). The Dice coefficients reached 0.748 and 0.730, respectively, for the Coronacases and Radiopedia datasets. Meanwhile, the precision and sensitivity for lesion segmentationdetection are 0.813 and 0.735 for the Coronacases dataset, and 0.773 and 0.726 for the Radiopedia dataset. The performance is comparable to existing supervised segmentation networks and outperforms previous unsupervised ones.

The segmentation result can serve as a baseline for further manual modification and a quality assurance tool for lesion diagnosis.

Central to meeting testing demands are specimens that can be easily and reliably collected and laboratory capacity to rapidly ramp up to scale. We and others have demonstrated that high and consistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in saliva from COVID-19 inpatients, outpatients, and asymptomatic individuals. As saliva collection is non-invasive, extending this strategy to test pooled saliva samples from multiple individuals could thus provide a simple method to expand testing capacity. However, hesitation towards pooled sample testing arises due to the dilution of positive samples, potentially shifting weakly positive samples below the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 and thereby decreasing the sensitivity. Here, we investigated the potential of pooling saliva samples by 5, 10, and 20 samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on samples tested, we conservatively estimated a reduction of 7.41%, 11.11%, and 14.81% sensitivity, for each of the pool sizes, respectively. Using these estimates we modeled anticipated changes in RT-qPCR cycle threshold to show the practical impact of pooling on results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. In tested populations with greater than 3% prevalence, testing samples in pools of 5 requires the least overall number of tests. Below 1% however, pools of 10 or 20 are more beneficial and likely more supportive of ongoing surveillance strategies.","output":"Pooling saliva to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aims to evaluate whether influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 Data from the Italian cross-sectional web-based survey (EPICOVID19), based on a self-selection sample of individuals aged 18, were considered The probability of a positive SARS-CoV-2 NPS test result as a function of influenza or anti-pneumococcal vaccination was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, stratifying analysis by age (&lt;65 years, 65 years) From April 2020, 170,731 individuals aged &lt;65 years and 28,097 65 years filled out the EPICOVID19 questionnaire Influenza and anti-pneumococcal vaccinations were received, respectively, by 16% and 2% of those &lt;65 years, and by 53% and 13% of those 65 years SARS-CoV-2 NPS testing was reported by 6680 participants Anti-pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations were associated with a decreased probability of a SARS-CoV-2 NPS positive test in the younger participants (OR = 0 61, 95% CI 0 41C0 91;OR = 0 85, 95%CI 0 74C0 98;respectively) A significantly lower probability of a positive test result was detected in the individuals 65 years who received anti-pneumococcal vaccination (OR = 0 56, 95%CI 0 33C0 95) These results need to be confirmed by further investigations, but they are relevant given the probable coexistence of influenza, bacterial infections, and COVID-19 over the coming autumnCwinter season","output":"The Association between Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccinations and SARS-Cov-2 Infection: Data from the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rethinking of the contours of state intervention, especially in social sectors like health The argument for rolling back the state has become questionable even among mainstream commentators Kerala's experience shows how public investment in healthcare and a participatory mode of governance with empowered local governments can help in pandemic mitigation A truly federal set-up with shared responsibilities between the centre and states is better suited to deal with situations like the present one rather than a centralised system","output":"Challenges in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: fn individuals with mental disorders, the COVID-19 pandemic involves acute distress and the risk of long-term effects.

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","output":"Policy disparities in fighting COVID-19 among Japan, Italy, Singapore and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementation research is a multidisciplinary field that addresses the complex phenomenon of how context influences our ability to deliver evidence-informed healthcare. There is increasing realisation of the importance of applying robust implementation research to scale-up life-saving interventions that meet health-related sustainable development goals. However, the lack of high-quality implementation research is impeding our ability to meet these targets, globally. Within implementation research, theory refers to the proposed hypothesis and/or explanation of how an intervention is expected to interact with the local context and actors to bring about change. Although there is increasing interest in applying theory to understand how and why implementation programmes work in real-world settings, global health actors still tend to favour impact evaluations conducted in controlled environments. This may, in part, be due to the relative novelty as well as methodological complexity of implementation research and the need to draw on divergent disciplines, including epidemiology, implementation science and social sciences. Because of this, implementation research is faced with a particular set of challenges about how to reconcile different ways of thinking and constructing knowledge about healthcare interventions. To help translate some of the ambiguity surrounding how divergent theoretical approaches and methods contribute to implementation research, we draw on our multidisciplinary expertise in the field, particularly in global health. We offer an overview of the different theoretical approaches and describe how they are applied to continuously select, monitor and evaluate implementation strategies throughout the different phases of implementation research. In doing so, we offer a relatively brief, user-focused guide to help global health actors implement and report on evaluation of evidence-based and scalable interventions, programmes and practices.","output":"A guide to systems-level, participatory, theory-informed implementation research in global health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In March 2020, Stockholm, Sweden was hit by a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly. Methods Five companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR. Results Among home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%). Conclusions Personnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employees likely to be pre-symptomatic for COVID-19 can be readily identified by screening.

Overall, the greatest increase in COVID-19 incidence was in northern Colorado, i.e., Weld County, which reported the highest rates in the Urban Front Range. Social and health determinants associated with higher COVID-19-related deaths were population density and asthma, indicative of urban areas, and poverty and unemployment, suggestive of rural areas.

The use of dexamethasone has proven benefit, although the risks and benefits are not fully characterized nor is the optimal dose of steroid. The benefits of steroids may include reduced inflammation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the risk might include increased viral replication and/or risk of secondary infection. Using a retrospective review of our ICU experience (prior to RECOVERY NEJM publication) we sought to characterize the relationship between steroid use and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients in order to test the hypothesis that steroid dose may be associated with worse ICU outcomes in some patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of our ICU experience from a large academic medical center. We defined secondary infection as positive bacterial or fungal culture from blood stream, urine or sputum deemed by the clinical team to require intervention. Among 130 consecutive patients who received critical care for COVID-19, we identified 41 who had received steroids in the ICU. Among these, 13 had received steroids prior to secondary infection (GP1) whereas 13 had secondary infection documented prior to receiving steroid (GP2) and 15 received steroids without secondary infection (GP3). Results: We observed mortality in all patients involved in this study (n=130) of 27.7%. Among patients who received steroids (n=41) of 29.3% vs. patients who never received steroids (n=89) of 27%. Mortality specific to the steroids groups was 15.4% for GP1 (n=13) vs. 53.8% for GP2 (n=13) vs. 20% for GP3 (n=15). Conclusions: We did not observe an impact of steroid dosage on the risk of secondary infection in a critically ill cohort of COVID-19 patients. We did observe a high mortality among patients who received steroids following documented secondary infection, but further work will be required to determine if this finding reflects confounding by indication i.e. whether steroids are a marker of sicker patients. Optimal steroid dosage in COVID remains unclear, but higher doses (as were given in the DExa-ARDS study) should be rigorously studied.","output":"The effect of steroid dosing on risk of secondary infection in COVID-19 critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A system of 5,020 robotic fiber positioners was installed in 2019 on the Mayall Telescope, at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

The main objective of the present study was to assess the risk of exercise addiction among a Saudi Arabian sample of regular exercisers and to investigate possible associations between their inability to exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (due to the closure of public gyms, swimming pools, and health clubs) and depression, anxiety, and loneliness. A total of 388 regular-exercising Saudis participated in an online cross-sectional survey over three months (December to February 2021). The study sample comprised 89.9% (males) and 10.1% (females), with a mean age of 28.59 years (SD  6.69). A 36-item online self-report survey was used for data collection. The prevalence of being at risk of exercise addiction among participants of the present study was 13.1%. Positive significant associations were noted between risk of exercise addiction and depression (r = .41; p < .01), risk of exercise addiction and anxiety (r = .20; p < .01), and risk of exercise addiction and loneliness (r = .17; p < .01). The findings of the present study suggest that those individuals at risk of exercise addiction might also be at an elevated risk of developing negative psychological impact owing to the disruption of the amount of exercise engaged in due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and therefore these high-risk individuals should receive appropriate psychological support to help them overcome the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic.

We aim to describe the incidence, associated variables, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for all critically ill adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) admitted to the ICU at a large academic medical center with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13, 2020 and April 18, 2020 were prospectively collected. Patients with serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations greater than 1000 U/L were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Patients were further stratified as having moderate (serum CK concentration 1000-4999 U/L) or severe (serum CK concentration &#8805;5000 U/L) rhabdomyolysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify outcomes and variables associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis. RESULTS: Of 235 critically ill COVID-19 patients, 114 (48.5%) met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Patients with rhabdomyolysis more often required mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), prone positioning (P < 0.001), pharmacological paralysis (P < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (P = 0.010), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (P = 0.025). They also had longer median ICU length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and hospital LOS (P < 0.001). No difference in mortality was observed. Male sex, patients with morbid obesity, SOFA score, and prone positioning were independently associated with rhabdomyolysis.

METHODS This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. RESULTS The ICU group had higher rates of preexisting comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P<0.05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P=0.012, 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P=0.002, 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P=0.008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P<0.001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (OR [95% CI]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P=0.998]).

As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.","output":"Reverse genetic characterization of the natural genomic deletion in SARS-Coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1 open reading frame 7b reveals an attenuating function of the 7b protein in-vitro and in-vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mass screening for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Iran on March 23, 2020, with the purpose of improving early detection of patients for their own health and to prevent onward transmission to others In this study, we evaluated the impact of the change towards mass screening on new cases reported, cases recovered, and deaths due to COVID-19 METHODS: This study analyzed the daily reports on the number of new cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, cases recovered, and deaths due to COVID-19 provided to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran Changes in trends on these outcomes were evaluated using interrupted time series analysis RESULTS: From February 19 to May 6, 2020, a total of 519544 COVID-19 tests were done and 101650 diagnoses were made (case/ test ratio 19 6%) For the same period, 6418 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported (case fatality ratio 6 3%) The number of cases detected increased significantly over the period of scale-up of mass screening (P=0 003), as did the number of recovered cases (P=0 001) The number of deaths due to COVID-19 did not change before versus after mass screening CONCLUSION: Following the scale-up of mass screening for COVID-19 in Iran, the rate of new cases detected and reported recovered accelerated significantly Mass screening is likely to have detected many mild and asymptomatic cases that were infectious Our data support the role that mass screening, coupled with isolation and contract tracing, can have in slowing the COVID-19 epidemic","output":"Impact of Mass Screening on the Number of Confirmed Cases, Recovered Cases, and Deaths Due to COVID-19 in Iran: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Blood purification through the removal of plasma solutes by adsorption to beads of charcoal or resins contained in a cartridge (hemoperfusion) has a long and imperfect history.

METHODS: We performed a narrative assessment of the literature with focus on the technology, characteristics, and principles of hemoperfusion. We assessed publications in ex vivo, animal, and human studies. We synthesized such literature in a technical and state-of-the-art summary. RESULTS: Early hemoperfusion studies were hampered by bioincompatibility. Recent technology, however, has improved its safety. Hemoperfusion has been used with positive effects in chronic dialysis and chronic liver disease. It has also demonstrated extraction of a variety of toxins and drugs during episodes of overdose. Trials with endotoxin binding polymyxin B have shown mixed results in septic shock and are under active investigation. The role of non-selective hemoperfusion in sepsis or inflammation remains. Although new technologies have made sorbents more biocompatible, the research agenda in the field remains vast. CONCLUSION: New sorbents markedly differ from those used in the past because of greater biocompatibility and safety.

METHODS: Using a framing theory approach, we analysed how screening and diagnostic AI was represented in the media and the frequency with which media articles addressed the benefits and the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSIs) of screening and diagnostic AI. RESULTS: All the media articles coded (n = 136) fit into at least one of three frames: social progress (n = 131), economic development (n = 59), and alternative perspectives (n = 9). Most of the articles were positively framed, with 135 of the articles discussing benefits of screening and diagnostic AI, and only 9 articles discussing the ethical, legal, and social implications.

Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody to Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. An increasing number of studies across the world is reporting the use of tocilizumab in treating COVID-19 patients or at risk of developing cytokine storm. Apart from clinical and laboratory parameters, High Resolution Computed Tomographic (HRCT) chest scan is a promising tool to identify patients very early in the course of COVID-19 disease. Aim: The purpose of this retrospective research study is to find whether high chest CT Severity Score (CTSS) on HRCT thorax scan predict the clinical requirement of tocilizumab injection in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, during the period from May 2020 to July, 2020, 250 patients with confirmed Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed of COVID-19 on first or repeat sample and who also underwent HRCT scan of the chest, were assigned chest CTSS. From data obtained, patients were categorised into two groups based on mild and severe CTSS. Patients with higher CTSS have a higher future possibility of developing the cytokine storm and hence the requirement of tocilizumab can be reliably predicted. All statistical analysis was performed in IBM SPSS version 20. Results: Out of a total of 250 patients, 72 patients were given tocilizumab injection. The average CTSS was 29.86.38 in the tocilizumab injection group. Only 8% of patients with mild CTSS received tocilizumab injection while 60% of patients with severe CTSS received tocilizumab injection (p<0.001). Out of 72 patients who received tocilizumab injection, 16.7% had mild CTSS while 83.3% had severe CTSS (p<0.001). Average values of inflammatory markers like CRP, D-Dimer, Ferritin, LDH, and IL-6;were significantly higher in severe CTSS and tocilizumab group (p<0.001). Conclusion: CTSS may be used as a new decisive tool in triaging in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Categorising patients in mild and severe CTSS early in the disease course, even before the marked worsening of laboratory parameters and development of cytokine storm may help initiate early treatment and thereby save many lives.","output":"Prediction of clinical requirement of tocilizumab injection in COVID-19 patients with high chest CT severity score - A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on angiotensin-converting enzyme II.

Each session was completed virtually with a certified exercise oncology trainer. Fitness and psychological parameters were measured preexercise and postexercise intervention. Overall, participants completed 4949 of 5892 prescribed exercise sessions.

Due its high morbility and mortality, it is necessary to summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients to provide more theoretical basis for future treatment. In the current study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the risk factors for the severity of illness. A total of 101 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Leishenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was classified into three sub-types: moderate (n = 47), severe (n = 36), and critical (n = 18); their clinical data were collected from the Electronic Medical Record. We showed that among the 101 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 62 years (IQR 51-74); 50 (49.5%) patients were accompanied by hypertension, while 25 (24.8%) and 22 (21.8%) patients suffered from diabetes and heart diseases, respectively, with complications. All patients were from Wuhan who had a definite history of exposure to the epidemic area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, percentage of neutrophils (N%) > 75%, CRP > 4 mg/L, D-dimer > 0.55 mg/L, IL-2R > 710 U/mL, IL-8 > 62 pg/mL, and IL-10 > 9.1 pg/mL were independent variables associated with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified the independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, including older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, higher levels of N%, CRP, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-8, and IL-10, providing evidence for more accurate risk prediction.","output":"Clinical characteristics and related risk factors of disease severity in 101 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current COVID-19 pandemic presents a substantial obstacle to cancer patient care.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). Although this analysis represents patients with cardiac comorbidities (hypertension), the inclusion of biomarkers from other pathophysiologies implicated in COVID-19 (e.g., D-dimer for thrombotic events, CRP for infection or inflammation, and PCT for bacterial co-infection and sepsis) may improve future predictions for a more general population. These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data. Clinical decision support tools for COVID-19 have strong potential to empower healthcare providers to save lives by prioritizing critical care in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.","output":"Clinical decision support tool and rapid point-of-care platform for determining disease severity in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections can cause serious diseases for humans and animals. Accurate and early detection of viruses is often crucial for clinical diagnosis and therapy. Aptamers are mostly single-stranded nucleotide sequences that are artificially synthesized by an in vitro technology known as the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). Similar to antibodies, aptamers bind specifically to their targets. However, compared with antibody, aptamers are easy to synthesize and modify and can bind to a broad range of targets. Thus, aptamers are promising for detecting viruses and treating viral infections. In this review, we briefly introduce aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) and describe their applications in rapid detection of viruses and as antiviral agents in treating infections. We summarize available data about the use of aptamers to detect and inhibit viruses. Furthermore, for the first time, we list aptamers specific to different viruses that have been screened out but have not yet been used for detecting viruses or treating viral infections.

Existing resource trading could facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, may often incur unexpected negotiation latency and energy consumption, trading failures and unfair pricing, due to the unpredictable nature of the resource trading process. Motivated by these challenges, an efficient futures-based resource trading mechanism for edge computing-assisted UAV network is proposed, where a mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contract is devised to promote resource trading between an MEC server (seller) and a UAV (buyer). Two key problems i.e. futures contract design before trading and power optimization during trading are studied. By analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource supply, demand, and air-to-ground communication quality, the contract design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize both the seller's and the buyer's expected utilities, while estimating their acceptable risk tolerance. Accordingly, we propose an efficient bilateral negotiation scheme to help players reach a trading consensus on the amount of resources and the relevant price. For the power optimization problem, we develop a practical algorithm that enables the buyer to determine its optimal transmission power via convex optimization techniques. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed mechanism offers both players considerable utilities, while outperforming the onsite trading mechanism on trading failures and fairness, negotiation latency, and cost.","output":"Let' s Trade in The Future!

Primary risk factors of interest were an influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to infection and oseltamivir prescriptions (filled on the day diagnosis, the following day, or 2-5 days). A multivariable logistic regression model was run to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalizations within 30 days of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2 395 498 influenza infections, 0.27% were hospitalized. Of those prescribed oseltamivir the day of diagnosis, 0.13% were later hospitalized, compared to 0.67% among those who filled prescriptions the following day and 11.8% when filled within 2 to 5 days. Upon adjustment, oseltamivir prescriptions filled on the day of diagnosis were associated with significantly decreased odds of hospitalization (OR 0.51 CI 0.48-0.55).

BACKGROUND New Zealand's nursing workforce is becoming increasingly multicultural as foreign nurses make up an essential part of the New Zealand health workforce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the contributions that nurses have made in providing frontline services to the public. However, little has been documented about challenges and experiences of this minority ethnic group - Chinese nurses - who have been working as registered nurses in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study utilised an anonymous online questionnaire and a thematic approach to establishing understandings of the experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity in working through the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 51 Chinese nurses completed this survey. A self-explanatory checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys (CHERRIES) was used for the purpose of the quality of this online survey. RESULTS The result showed that 47.06% participants (n=24) reported negative experiences including racial discrimination, workplace bullying and judgement, while 52.94% (n=27) participants reported positive working experiences including supports received in the workplace and positive recognition by the pubic in New Zealand. CONCLUSION Ethnic-minority nurses are key assets to the New Zealand health system. It is important to understand their experiences and challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure they are supported and protected from any physical and emotional injury. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE COVID-19 has brought additional challenges and concerns to nurses who are working on the frontline of health services. Having knowledge of nurses' working experiences will help with their job satisfaction and has potential implications for the sustainability of the New Zealand nursing workforce and retention strategies to address nursing workforce shortages which is foreseeable in New Zealand.","output":"Experiences of New Zealand Registered Nurses of Chinese Ethnicity During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Greater than or equal to 8 mm was often used as the safe diameter of primary duct closure (PDC) after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) in previous studies, but it is impossible to verify the source of this safe diameter, and lack of evidence for the safe diameter of PDC.

Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O3 pollution suggested that super-regional (i.e. central and eastern China) and regional (i.e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O3 levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O3 formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Its goal during a pandemic was to keep patients from seeking unnecessary in-person care from emergency departments and urgent care clinics, especially when dental practices were closed or limited to providing essential urgent and emergency oral health care. METHODS: The Adams School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed the Carolina Dentistry Virtual Oral Health Care Helpline using a quality improvement framework with faculty and staff member feedback. The process included establishing infrastructure (phone, video, protocols, referrals, documentation), personnel (scheduling, training, calibration), and internal and external communication. The authors collected retrospective information for descriptive evaluation of the first month's operations. RESULTS: There were 337 telephone calls answered, of which 65 (19%) were administrative and 272 (81%) were related to dental concerns. Dental pain (54%) was the most prevalent reason for calling. Triage and Providers referred 107 of 175 callers (61%) to the school's urgent care center. Of the 79 callers who received teleconsultations from virtual providers, 33 (42%) did not require additional follow-up, and 7 (9%) needed a follow-up phone call. Overall, 4 people were referred to community clinics, and 4 were referred to the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The Helpline was launched quickly and improved through quality improvement cycles, and it provided a needed community dental service.

These RACsw,ch are compared to the maximum tested concentration of more realistic exposure scenarios. However, the actual exposure duration could be notably shorter (e.g. hours) than the standard study. This, by purpose leads to an overly conservative Tier 1 RA. This discrepancy can be addressed in a RA using the time-weighted average concentration (TWAc). In Europe, the applicability of TWAc for a particular RA is evaluated using a complex decision scheme. Due to controversial discussions on this scheme, we propose an alternative approach: We use TWAc-check to test whether the use of a TWAc is appropriate for aquatic RA. TWAc-check is based on the idea that the TWAc concept is just a model for aquatic RA. TWAc-check works by testing how well the TWAc model predicts experimental data from peak exposure experiments with predicted-measured diagrams. Overestimated effects are accepted since the conservatism of the TWAc model is prioritized over the goodness of fit. We illustrate the applicability of TWAc-check by applying it to various data sets for different species and substances. We demonstrate that the applicability is case dependent. Specifically, TWAc-check correctly identifies that the use of TWAc is not appropriate for early onset of effects or delayed effects. The proposed concept shows that the time window is a decisive factor as to whether or not the model is acceptable and can be used as a potential refinement option prior to the use of TK/TD models.

All studies containing infected COVID-19 pregnant women who had given birth were included, and the search was done up to April 14, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 21 articles were reviewed, and clinical characteristics of 90 pregnant patients and 92 neonates born to mothers infected with COVID-19 were reviewed. The most common symptoms included fever, cough, and dyspnea. The main laboratory findings included leukocytosis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein. The most commonly reported complications were preterm labor and fetal distress. Three mothers were admitted to ICU and required mechanical ventilation; among them, one died, and one was on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Diagnosis and treatment of TB infection requires completion of a sequence of steps, collectively termed the TB infection care cascade. There has been no systematic attempt to comprehensively summarise literature on the paediatric TB infection care cascade. METHODS We performed a scoping review of the paediatric TB infection care cascade. We systematically searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane and Embase databases. We reviewed articles and meeting abstracts that included children and adolescents 21 years old who were screened for or diagnosed with TB infection, and which described completion of at least one step of the cascade. We synthesised studies to identify facilitators and barriers to retention, interventions to mitigate attrition and knowledge gaps. RESULTS We identified 146 studies examining steps in the paediatric TB infection care cascade; 31 included children living in low-income and middle-income countries. Most literature described the final cascade step (treatment initiation to completion). Studies identified an array of patient and caregiver-related factors associated with completion of cascade steps. Few health systems factors were evaluated as potential predictors of completion, and few interventions to improve retention were specifically tested. CONCLUSIONS We identified strengths and gaps in the literature describing the paediatric TB infection care cascade.

This study describes development of instrumentation and techniques for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using laser-assisted soldering technology. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Anesthetized 20 kg to 25 kg female Yorkshire pigs underwent laparoscopy with a 3-trocar technique. Parietex TET, Parietex TEC, and Prolene mesh segments (5 x 5 cm) were embedded in 55% collagen solder. Segments were inserted by using a specially designed introducer and affixed to the peritoneum by using prototype laser devices (1.45 micro, 4.5 W continuous wave, 5-mm spot, 55 degrees C set temperature) and a custom laparoscopic handpiece (IPOM). Parietex PCO mesh was inserted and affixed using the Endo-hernia stapler (Control). Animals were recovered and underwent second-look laparoscopy at 6 weeks. Mesh sites were harvested after animals were euthanized. RESULTS The mesh-solder constructs were easily inserted and affixed in an IPOM approach. Prolene mesh tended to curl at its edges as the solder was melted. Postoperative healing was similar to that in Control segments in all cases. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Collagen-based tissue soldering permits normal wound healing and may mitigate or reduce the use of staples or other foreign bodies for laparoscopic mesh fixation, prevent tissue ischemia and possibly nerve entrapment, which result in severe postoperative pain and morbidity.

Crucially, recent findings suggest that this effect can be detected in bilingual infants before their first birthday indicating that it emerges as a result of early bilingual exposure and the experience of negotiating two linguistic systems in infants' environment. However, these conclusions are based on only two research studies from the last decade (Comishen, Bialystok, & Adler, 2019; Kovcs & Mehler, 2009), so to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding their replicability and generalizability. In addition, previous research does not shed light on the precise aspects of bilingual experience and the extent of bilingual exposure underlying the emergence of this early bilingual advantage. The present study addressed these two questions by assessing attentional control abilities in 7-month-old bilingual infants in comparison to same-age monolinguals and in relation to their individual bilingual exposure patterns. Findings did not reveal significant differences between monolingual and bilingual infants in the measure of attentional control and no relation between individual performance and degree of bilingual exposure.

Thus, this study indicates that bilingualism modulates attentional processes early on, possibly as a result of bilinguals' experience of encoding dual-language information from a complex linguistic input, but it does not lead to significant advantages in attentional control in the first year of life.","output":"The effects of bilingualism on attentional processes in the first year of life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant number of changes to elective and emergency neurosurgical practice.Materials and Methods: This paper reports the results of an online survey of Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS) members undertaken between 10th and 24th of June 2020 regarding changes in consent practice in response to COVID-19, as well as the physical challenges experienced while operating under higher levels of personal protective equipment (PPE).Results: Despite the real and substantial risks associated with COVID-19, 23% of surgeons reported they were not made any changes to their usual consent process, and 54% of surgeons indicated that they made reference to COVID-19-associated risks in their written consent documentation. 93% of neurosurgeons reported physical difficulties operating using PPE; 62% reported visors/goggles fogging up, 55% experienced 'overheating', 62% reported fatigue, and 82% of surgeons reported difficulty communicating with the theatre staff.Conclusions: This survey highlights discrepancies in the consent practice between neurosurgeons which needs to be addressed at both local and national levels. The PPE being used in neurosurgical operations is not designed for use with specialist equipment (82% of respondents reported having to remove PPE to use the microscope) and the reported physical difficulties using PPE intraoperatively could significantly impact on both neurosurgeon performance and patient outcomes.

Multiple infectious agents can contribute to this condition, with some viruses such as species A rotavirus (RVA) playing a major role. Studies on their occurrence and genetic diversity are essential for development of RVA vaccines. In this study, fecal samples from diarrheic suckling piglets originating from farms distributed throughout Spain were analyzed for RVA and four other common enteric pathogens using molecular methods. The individual prevalence was 89.4%, 64.4%, 44.9%, 33.7% and 4.4% for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, species A rotavirus, species C rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, respectively. Most specimens (96.9%) were positive for at least one of the target pathogens and concurrent infections were common. The molecular characterization of RVA positive specimens of specific genes used for genotyping revealed the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains circulating in swine herds in Spain. Comparison with genotypes contained in the commercial vaccine available in Spain showed differences in the identity of the predominant RVA genotypes from diarrheic piglets in the sampled pig farms. These findings contribute to the surveillance of RVA strains circulating in swine herds in Spain and may help optimize target vaccine design. ABSTRACT: Species A rotavirus (RVA) is a major viral pathogen causing diarrhea in suckling piglets. Studies on its genetic heterogeneity have implications for vaccine efficacy in the field. In this study, fecal samples (n = 866) from diarrheic piglets younger than 28 days were analyzed over a two-year period (2018C2019). Samples were submitted from 426 farms located in 36 provinces throughout Spain and were tested using real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for five enteric pathogens. The individual prevalence was 89.4%, 64.4%, 44.9%, 33.7% and 4.4% for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, species A rotavirus, species C rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, respectively. Most specimens (96.9%) were positive for at least one of the target pathogens, and more than 80% of samples harbored mixed infections. Nucleotide sequencing of 70 specimens positive for RVA revealed the presence of the VP7 genotypes G4, G9, G3, G5, G11 and the VP4 genotypes P7, P23, P6 and P13, with the combinations G4P7 and G9P23 being the most prevalent, and especially in the areas with the highest pig population. The study shows the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains as well as discrepancies with the genotypes contained in the vaccine available in Spain, and multiple amino acid differences in antigenic epitopes of different G- and P- genotypes with the vaccine strains. Further investigations are needed to determine the efficacy of the vaccine to confer clinical protection against heterologous strains.","output":"Occurrence of Rotavirus A Genotypes and Other Enteric Pathogens in Diarrheic Suckling Piglets from Spanish Swine Farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical and prognostic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic older patients with COVID-19 are of great interest since frail patients often show atypical presentation of illness. Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been proven to be a reliable tool for detecting early-phase COVID-19 pneumonic alterations. The current prospective bicentric study aimed to compare LUS score and 3-month overall mortality between asymptomatic and symptomatic older patients with COVID-19, according to frailty status. Patients were stratified according to LUS score tertiles and Clinical Frailty Scale categories. Survival rate was assessed by telephone interviews 3 months after discharge. 64 symptomatic (24 women, aged 80.0  10.8 years) and 46 asymptomatic (31 women, aged 84.3  8.8 years) were consecutively enrolled. LUS score resulted an independent predictor of 3-month mortality [OR 2.27 (CI95% 1.09C4.8), p = 0.03], and the highest mortality rate was observed in symptomatic and asymptomatic pre-frail and frail patients (70.6% and 66.7%, respectively) with greater LUS abnormalities (3rd tertile). In conclusion, LUS identified an acute interstitial lung involvement in most of the older asymptomatic patients.

However, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 can result in non-mortal complications that affect patient prognosis. To support patient risk stratification, we aimed to develop a prognostic system that predicts complications common to COVID-19. In this retrospective study, we used data collected from 3,352 COVID-19 patient encounters admitted to 18 facilities between April 1 and April 30, 2020, in Abu Dhabi (AD), UAE. The hospitals were split based on geographical proximity to assess for our proposed system's learning generalizability, AD Middle region and AD Western & Eastern regions, A and B, respectively. Using data collected during the first 24 hours of admission, the machine learning-based prognostic system predicts the risk of developing any of seven complications during the hospital stay. The complications include secondary bacterial infection, AKI, ARDS, and elevated biomarkers linked to increased patient severity, including d-dimer, interleukin-6, aminotransferases, and troponin. During training, the system applies an exclusion criteria, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection for each complication-specific model. The system achieves good accuracy across all complications and both regions. In test set A (587 patient encounters), the system achieves 0.91 AUROC for AKI and >0.80 AUROC for most of the other complications. In test set B (225 patient encounters), the respective system achieves 0.90 AUROC for AKI, elevated troponin, and elevated interleukin-6, and >0.80 AUROC for most of the other complications. The best performing models, as selected by our system, were mainly gradient boosting models and logistic regression.

The motivation of this technique is that it facilitates the diagnosis and classification of affected patients based on two categories namely mild (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) so as to facilitate allocation of medical facilities within the context of available limited resources. This is considering the fact that as the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing with limited facilities/resources to cope with pace at which confirmed cases arise, early recognition and classification of the level of severity of COVID-19 is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"COVID19 Infectious Disease Detection and Diagnosis System Using Case-Based Reasoning and Fuzzy Logic Inference Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Increased stress among medical personnel had been reported in previous virus outbreaks. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No qualitative assessment has yet described the physical and mental health conditions of frontline medical personnel in the COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods: Here, 251 frontline medical personnel involved in COVID-19 missions completed electronic questionnaires, consisting of 31 categorical variables related to their physical and mental health status, medical history and environmental conditions. We constructed a correlation amongst these variables through pairwise Kendall rank correlation coefficient test. Then, clusters of highly correlated variables were identified using the leading eigenvector. Finally, we used the network and clusters to clarify the correlations amongst variables. Results: This qualitative study identified the six clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by skin allergy. Cluster 2 was predominantly associated with anxiety. Cluster 3 consisted mostly of respiratory symptoms. The participants in cluster 4 had medical history. Cluster 5 and cluster 6 were characterized by disinfection and demography, respectively. Finally, we revealed three major findings. First, more than 80% of medical personnel worry about COVID-19-related infection and experience newly appearing anxiety (56.2%), airway or heart symptoms (34.3%) and skin allergies (20.3%). Second, COVID-19-related worry significantly associates with all variables in the anxiety and respiratory symptom clusters. Third, new-onset skin allergies did not associate with either disinfection or anxiety, but did associate with a previous history of allergies. Conclusions: COVID-19-related worry leads to physical and mental health problems amongst medical personnel.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and maximal surgical effort remain mainstays, but targeted therapies are becoming more widespread and new data have called into question the role of surgery for women with recurrent disease. Poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors have improved progression-free survival outcomes in both the frontline and recurrent settings, and their use has become increasingly widespread.

However, poor routine data undermines data-informed efforts to monitor and promote improvements in the quality of newborn care across hospitals. METHODS: Continuously collected routine patients data from structured paper record forms for all admissions to newborn units (NBUs) from 16 purposively selected Kenyan public hospitals that are part of a clinical information network were analysed together with data from all paediatric admissions ages 0C13 years from 14 of these hospitals. Data are used to show the proportion of all admissions and deaths in the neonatal age group and examine morbidity and mortality patterns, stratified by birth weight, and their variation across hospitals. FINDINGS: During the 354 hospital months study period, 90 222 patients were admitted to the 14 hospitals contributing NBU and general paediatric ward data. 46% of all the admissions were neonates (aged 0C28 days), but they accounted for 66% of the deaths in the age group 0C13 years. 41 657 inborn neonates were admitted in the NBUs across the 16 hospitals during the study period. 4266/41 657 died giving a crude mortality rate of 10.2% (95% CI 9.97% to 10.55%), with 60% of these deaths occurring on the first-day of admission. Intrapartum-related complications was the single most common diagnosis among the neonates with birth weight of 2000 g or more who died. A threefold variation in mortality across hospitals was observed for birth weight categories 1000C1499 g and 1500C1999 g. INTERPRETATION: The high proportion of neonatal deaths in hospitals may reflect changing patterns of childhood mortality. Majority of newborns died of preventable causes (>95%).

RESULTS: On March 11, 2020, the study included 1 488 605 adults with diabetes (median [IQR] age, 65 [55-74] years; 776 665 [52.2%] men), and on March 11, 2019, the study included 1 441 029 adults with diabetes (median [IQR] age, 65 [55-74] years; 751 459 [52.1%] men). After the onset of the pandemic, rates of major amputation in 2020-2021 decreased compared with 2019-2020 levels. The RR for the prepandemic period from January 1 to March 10 was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88-1.25), with RRs in the pandemic periods ranging from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.03) in May 20 to July 28 to 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.13) in October 7 to December 15. There were no consistent differences in demographic characteristics or comorbidities of patients undergoing amputation in the 2020-2021 vs 2019-2020 periods. Rates of comprehensive in-person diabetes care assessment and HbA(1c) measurement declined sharply and remained below 2019-2020 levels (eg, in-person assessment, March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.28-0.28). The rates of emergency department visits (eg, March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75), hospitalization (eg, March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87), open revascularization (eg, March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56-0.79), endovascular revascularization (March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81), and minor amputation (March 11 to May 19: RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83) initially dropped but recovered to 2019-2020 levels over the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study, disruptions in care related to the COVID-19 pandemic were not associated with excess leg amputations among people living with diabetes. As the pandemic ends, improved prevention and treatment of diabetic foot complications will be necessary to maintain these positive results.","output":"A Population-Based Analysis of Diabetes-Related Care Measures, Foot Complications, and Amputation During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent, painful, and malodorous abscesses and nodules predominantly in skin folds. HS is associated with substantial morbidity and poor quality of life. There are no curative therapies, and the only approved biologic drug has variable efficacy and requires high doses, making adjunct treatments crucial. An important risk factor for disease severity is obesity. Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review examining weight loss and dietary interventions, in HS. Our secondary objective was to examine nutritional supplements in HS.A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database. We included all study types in adults (>18 years), with a minimum sample size of 5, examining the effects of any dietary or weight loss intervention on HS severity. Two authors screened n = 1279 articles of which 9 met inclusion criteria. All included studies were observational and all interventions were associated with various measures of decreased HS severity. Patient-controlled weight loss and bariatric surgery were associated with HS regression, though a subset of patients with significant increase in panniculi experienced exacerbations and required excision of excess skin. Diets demonstrating benefit eliminated dairy and brewer's yeast. Nutritional supplements including zinc gluconate, vitamin D, and riboflavin had a suppressive, rather than curative, effect on HS lesions in single studies. Overall, the reviewed interventions show promise as potential adjunct treatments in a HS management plan.

Three conference abstract databases were also searched. We included any types of studies that reported characteristics of patients with MS with COVID-19. RESULTS: From an initial 2,679 publications and 3,138 conference abstracts, 87 studies (67 published articles and 20 abstracts) consisting of 4,310 patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 with MS met the inclusion criteria. The female/male ratio was 2.53:1, the mean (SD) age was 44.91 (4.31) years, the mean disease duration was 12.46 (2.27), the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 2.54 (0.81), the relapsing/progressive ratio was 4.75:1, and 32.9% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity.

Here we infected Syrian hamsters by authentic SARS-CoV-2 and built an ideal model to simulate the natural recovery process of SARS-CoV-2 infection from severe pneumonia1,2. We developed and applied a spatial transcriptomic sequencing technique with subcellular resolution and tissue-scale extensibility, i.e., Stereo-seq3, together with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to the entire lung lobes of 45 hamsters and obtained an elaborate map of the pulmonary spatiotemporal changes from acute infection, severe pneumonia to the late viral clearance and inflammation resolution. While SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive damages to the hamster lungs, including naive T cell infection and deaths related to lymphopenia, we identified a group of monocyte-derived proliferating Slamf9+Spp1+ macrophages, which were SARS-CoV-2 infection-inducible and cell death-resistant, recruiting neutrophils to clear viruses together. After viral clearance, the Slamf9+Spp1+ macrophages differentiated into Trem2+ and Fbp1+ macrophages, both responsible for inflammation resolution and replenishment of alveolar macrophages. The existence of this specific macrophage subpopulation and its descendants were validated by RNAscope in hamsters, immunofluorescence in hACE2 mice, and public human autopsy scRNA-seq data of COVID-19 patients.

The herb Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ or Lonicera japonica Thunb.) is used as an anti-inflammatory agent but the chemical quality of FLJ and its medicinal efficacy has not been consistent. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes and metabolic pathways to evaluate the active medicinal compounds in FLJ and hope that this approach can be used for a variety of medicinal herbs in the future. RESULTS We assess transcriptomic differences between FLJ and L. japonica Thunb. var. chinensis (Watts) (rFLJ), which may explain the variable medicinal effects. We acquired transcriptomic data (over 100 million reads) from the two herbs, using RNA-seq method and the Illumina GAII platform. The transcriptomic profiles contain over 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for each of the three flower development stages from FLJ, as well as comparable amount of ESTs from the rFLJ flower bud. To elucidate enzymatic divergence on biosynthetic pathways between the two varieties, we correlated genes and their expression profiles to known metabolic activities involving the relevant active compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and fatty acids. We also analyzed the diversification of genes that process the active compounds to distinguish orthologs and paralogs together with the pathways concerning biosynthesis of phenolic acid and its connections with other related pathways. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides both an initial description of gene expression profiles in flowers of FLJ and its counterfeit rFLJ and the enzyme pool that can be used to evaluate FLJ quality. Detailed molecular-level analyses allow us to decipher the relationship between metabolic pathways involved in processing active medicinal compounds and gene expressions of their processing enzymes. Our evolutionary analysis revealed specific functional divergence of orthologs and paralogs, which lead to variation in gene functions that govern the profile of active compounds.","output":"Genetic variation and metabolic pathway intricacy govern the active compound content and quality of the Chinese medicinal plant Lonicera japonica thunb."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) promotion and prevention (P&P) programmes' challenge lies in guaranteeing that follow-up strategies have a real impact on reducing CC-related mortality rates. CC P&P programme compliance and coverage rates are relevant indicators for evaluating their success and good performance; however, such indicators' frequency rates are considerably lower among women living in rural and border areas. This study was aimed at identifying factors associated with CC screening programme attendance for women living in Colombia's Amazon region. METHODS: This study (qualitative and quantitative phases) was carried out between September 2015 and November 2016; women residing in the border towns of Leticia and Puerto Nari?o participated in it. The first phase (qualitative) involved interviews and focus group discussions; this led to establishing factors related to CC P&P programme attendance which were used in the quantitative phase for designing a survey for determining the strength of association in a logistic regression model. The terms attendance and compliance were considered to apply to women who had followed the 1-1-3 scheme throughout their lives, i.e. a cytology examination every 3 years after receiving two consecutive negative annual cytology results. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 309 women (18-year-olds having an active sexual life, having resided in the target community for at least one year); 15.2% had suitable P&P programme follow-up. Screening programme attendance was positively associated with first intercourse after becoming 20 years-old (aOR: 3.87; 1.03-9.50 95%CI; p = 0.045), frequent contraceptive use (aOR: 3.11; 1.16-8.33 95%CI; p = 0.023), awareness of the age to participate in P&P programmes (aOR: 2.69; 1.08-6.68 95%CI; p = 0.032), awareness of cytology's usefulness in identifying cervical abnormalities (aOR: 2.43; 1.02-5.77 95%CI; p = 0.043) and considering cytology important (aOR: 2.64; 1.12-6.19 95%CI; p = 0.025). Women living in rural areas had a lower probability (aOR 0.43: 0.24-0.79 95%CI; p = 0.006) of adhering to CC P&P programmes. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings suggested the need for including novel strategies in screening programmes which will promote CC P&P activities going beyond hospital outpatient attendance to reach the most remote or widely scattered communities, having the same guarantees regarding access, opportunity and quality. Including education-related activities and stimulating the population's awareness regarding knowledge about CC prevention could be one of the main tools for furthering the impact of attendance at and compliance with P&P programmes.","output":"Cervical cancer screening programme attendance and compliance predictors regarding Colombia's Amazon region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines and discusses the biases and pitfalls of retrospective survey questions that are currently being used in many medical, epidemiological, and sociological studies on the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series from 2012 to 2014. SETTING Single tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS All cochlear implant recipients undergoing 1.5-T MRI without internal magnet removal. INTERVENTION(S) MRI after tight headwrap application. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient tolerance, complications, and characteristics of imaging artifact. RESULTS Nineteen ears underwent a total of 34 MRI scans. Two patients did not tolerate imaging with the headwrap in place and required magnet removal before rescanning. One subject experienced two separate episodes of polarity reversal in the same device from physical realignment (i.e., flipping) of the internal magnet requiring surgical repositioning. Three patients were discovered to have canting of the internal magnet after imaging. In all three cases, the magnet could be reseated by applying gentle firm pressure to the scalp until the magnet \\"popped\\" back into place. These patients continue to use their device without difficulty and have not required surgical replacement. In patients receiving head MRI, the ipsilateral internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle could be visualized without difficulty in 94% of cases. There were no episodes of cochlear implant device failure or soft tissue complications. CONCLUSION Under controlled conditions, 1.5-T MRI can be successfully performed in most patients without the need for cochlear implant magnet removal. In nearly all cases, imaging artifact does not impede evaluation of the ipsilateral skull base. Patients should be counseled regarding the risk of internal magnet movement that may occur in up to 15% of cases, even with tight headwrap application. If internal magnet polarity reversal occurs, a trial of reversing the external magnet can be considered. If canting or mild displacement of the internal magnet occurs, an attempt at reseating can be made by applying gentle firm pressure to the scalp over the internal magnet. If conservative measures fail, the magnet should be surgically repositioned to minimize interruption of device use and to prevent scalp complications.","output":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Cochlear Implant Magnet in Place: Safety and Imaging Quality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cholinergic transmission is essential for survival and reproduction, as it is involved in several physiological responses. In the auditory system, both ascending and descending auditory pathways are modulated by cholinergic transmission, affecting the perception of sounds. The auditory efferent system is a neuronal network comprised of several feedback loops, including corticofugal and brainstem pathways to the cochlear receptor. The auditory efferent system's -final and mandatory synapses that connect the brain with the cochlear receptor- involve medial olivocochlear neurons and outer hair cells. A unique cholinergic transmission mediates these synapses through 9/10 nicotinic receptors. To study this receptor, it was generated a strain of mice carrying a null mutation of the Chrna9 gene (9-KO mice), lacking cholinergic transmission between medial olivocochlear neurons and outer hair cells, providing a unique opportunity to study the role of medial olivocochlear cholinergic transmission in auditory and cognitive functions. In this article, we review behavioral and physiological studies carried out to research auditory efferent function in the context of audition, cognition, and hearing impairments. Auditory studies have shown that hearing thresholds in the 9-KO mice are normal, while more complex auditory functions, such as frequency selectivity and sound localization, are altered. The corticofugal pathways have been studied in 9-KO mice using behavioral tasks, evidencing a reduced capacity to suppress auditory distractors during visual selective attention. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary role of the auditory efferent system detecting vocalizations in noise and its role in auditory disorders, such as the prevention of age-related hearing loss.","output":"Corticofugal and Brainstem Functions Associated With Medial Olivocochlear Cholinergic Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This review aims to investigate the association of sex with the risk of multiple COVID-19 health outcomes, ranging from infection to death.

Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted using standardised electronic data extraction forms with the assessment of Newcastle Ottawa Scale for risk of bias. Pooled trends in infection, hospitalization, severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death rate were calculated separately for men and women and subsequently random-effects meta-analyses on relative risks (RR) for sex was performed. Results: Of 10,160 titles, 229 studies comprising 10,417,452 patients were included in the analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was high (6.9 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (RR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.07 to 1.21).

Somewhat surprisingly, the ablation of CCR2 and CCL2 resulted in starkly contrasting susceptibility to JE. CCR2 ablation induced enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation highly increased susceptibility to JE.

Based on 6,802 patients with all-seven-bacteria tested, 4.43% (95% CI: 3.94%?4.91%) had at least one bacteria-positive detection, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis were the leading bacterium in children aged <5 years and 5?17 years, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected in adults aged 18?59 and 60 years. The pathogen spectrum also differed statistically significantly between northern and southern China. Joinpoint analysis revealed age-specific positive rates, with enterovirus, herpes simplex virus and mumps virus peaking at 3?6 years old, while Japanese encephalitis virus peaked in the 60 years old. As age increased, the positive rate for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli statistically significantly decreased, while for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis it increased. INTERPRETATION: The current findings allow enhanced identification of the predominant AME-related pathogen candidates for diagnosis in clinical practice and more targeted application of prevention and control measures in China, and a possible reassessment of vaccination strategy.

Early reports from China have highlighted the risks associated with performing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present a rare complication of nasoseptal flap (NSF) necrosis associated with COVID-19, further emphasizing the challenges of performing these procedures in this era. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled NSF. The patient developed meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on postoperative day 13, requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fever and rhinorrhea. The patient was reexplored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Postoperatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of NSF necrosis in a patient with COVID-19. We postulate that the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may have contributed to vascular pedicle thrombosis and NSF necrosis. Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on the nasal tissues is still being elucidated, this case highlights some challenges of performing endoscopic skull base surgery in the era of COVID-19.","output":"Nasoseptal Flap Necrosis After Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery in the Setting of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present work is to establish an approximate analytical solution for the nonlinear Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered (SEIR) model applied to novel coronavirus COVID-19.

The aim of this paper is to present a case with COVID-like pneumonia, with fatal evolution. The clinical aspects were correlated with the autopsy findings and discussed on the background of the most recent data from the medical literature. A 13-month-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with acute severe shortness of breath and pulmonary bilateral ground-glass opacities and an almost complete opacified left lung. The patient suddenly deteriorated, and death was confirmed 3 h after admission. At autopsy, severe desquamative interstitial pneumonia was diagnosed and was associated with an unusual IgA glomerulonephritis. No SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the lung parenchyma by RT- PCR. This is a very unusual case of rapid deterioration of an infant with idiopathic desquamative interstitial pneumonia (IDP) and multiorgan involvement. Based on immunohistochemical stains, we hypothesize that, in IDP, the hyaline membranes arise from necrotizing desquamated pneumocytes. In the COVID-19 era, such cases are extremely difficult to diagnose; they can mimic SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injuries. This pattern of hyaline membrane formation might explain the poor response to oxygen therapy. The present case highlights the importance of autopsy in such challenging cases.","output":"COVID-19 Like Findings in a Fatal Case of Idiopathic Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia Associated With IgA Glomerulonephritis in a 13-Month-Old Child"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 affects healthcare and social care systems around the world, reports of infection among healthcare and social care workers continue to accumulate.","output":"COVID-19 highlights risks of healthcare and social care workers attending work while ill."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of millions across the globe.

Left untreated, OME can negatively affect language, development, learning, and health and wellbeing throughout the life-course. Currently, OME care includes observation for 3 months followed by consideration of surgical ventilation tube insertion. The use of a non-invasive, low-cost nasal balloon autoinflation device has been found beneficial in other populations but has not been investigated among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial will determine the effectiveness of nasal balloon autoinflation compared to no nasal balloon autoinflation, for the treatment of OME among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia. Children aged 3C16 years with unilateral or bilateral OME are being recruited from Aboriginal Health Services and the community. The primary outcome is the proportion of children showing tympanometric improvement of OME at 1 month. Improvement is defined as a change from bilateral type B tympanograms to at least one type A or C1 tympanogram, or from unilateral type B tympanogram to type A or C1 tympanogram in the index ear, without deterioration (type A or C1 to type C2, C3, or B tympanogram) in the contralateral ear. A sample size of 340 children (170 in each group) at 1 month will detect an absolute difference of 15% between groups with 80% power at 5% significance. Anticipating a 15% loss to follow-up, 400 children will be randomised. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes include tympanometric changes at 3 and 6 months, hearing at 3 months, ear health-related quality of life (OMQ-14), and cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation including perspectives of parents or carers, health care providers, and researchers on trial implementation will also be undertaken. DISCUSSION: INFLATE will answer the important clinical question of whether nasal balloon autoinflation is an effective and acceptable treatment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with OME.

Tools integrating host-protein expression have proven useful in determining infection etiology and hold potential for prognosticating disease severity. METHODS Adults with COVID-19 were recruited at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States. Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10; also known as CXCL10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes. A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Patients were assigned to 4 score bins. RESULTS Between March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the signature was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77; p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78; p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001).

Current anatomy curriculum at Paul L. Foster School of Medicine consists of self-taught PowerPoint material, clinical vignette-centered team-based learning, and prosection-based instruction (wet lab). This study examined the impact of video-based instruction using a student-designed muscle model on anatomy quiz scores and student perceptions of its effectiveness on learning outcomes.Methods: Students divided into Group 1 (54 students) and Group 2 (53 students) were assessed prior to and following a 3.5-minute model-based video on anterior forearm compartment musculature. Group 1 received video instruction and assessment prior to the wet lab. Group 2 received video instruction and assessment following the wet lab. Both groups took an identical five-question quiz covering locations and functions of various anterior forearm muscles.Results: Mean scores were higher than no intervention with exposure to video alone (0.73 points, p=0.01), wet lab alone (0.88 points, p=0.002) and wet lab plus video instruction (1.35 points, p=<0.001). No significant difference in scores was found between video or wet lab alone (p=1.00), or between either instruction method alone compared to a combination of the two methods (p=0.34, 0.09). Student survey opinions on the instruction method were positive.Conclusion: Video-based muscle model instruction is comparable to prosection-based lab with regards to score outcomes and was well received by students as both an independent learning tool and as a supplement to cadaveric lab. When compared to model-based instruction or prosection-based instruction alone, the supplementation of anatomical models with cadaveric prosection instruction was best.

In this metastasis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is essential. Interaction with the cancer cell microenvironment is primarily dependent on M1- and M2-polarized macrophage. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we revealed the EMT-associated activity of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages in A549 lung cancer cells. We established a co-culture model of A549 lung cancer cells utilizing THP-1-derived M1/M2 polarised macrophages to explore the involvement of macrophages in the immune response, apoptosis, and EMT in lung cancer. Although multiple polarising agents are routinely used for M1 and M2 conversion, we assessed a new possible polarising agent, hydrocortisone. CONCLUSIONS: M1 increased A549 cell sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors and decreased A549 cell viability by inducing apoptosis. EMT was induced in the presence of M2c macrophages in A549 cells by the levels of vimentin, fibronectin, E-cadherin, NF-kB, CCL-17. We also revealed the antiproliferative effects of bortezomib and ixazomib on A549 cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. Our findings could help develop an immunotherapeutic strategy by shedding light on a previously undiscovered part of the EMT pathway. Furthermore, additional investigation may reveal that polarising tumour-associated macrophages to M1 and eliminating the M2a or particularly the M2c subtype are effective anti-cancer strategies.","output":"Proteasome inhibitor immunotherapy for the epithelial to mesenchymal transition: assessing the A549 lung cancer cell microenvironment and the role of M1, M2a and M2c 'hydrocortisone-polarised' macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les tudes descriptives initiales sur la COVID-19 se sont concentres sur les formes graves des personnes hospitalises.

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with >2.6 million confirmed infections and >183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS: We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag time-for example, 23 days-there could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duarte's elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above.

METHODS The articulating instruments tested were Laparo-Angle (Cambridge Endoscopic Devices Inc, Framingham, MA), RealHand (Novare Surgical Systems Inc, Cupertino, CA), and Roticulator (Covidien Inc, Mansfield, MA). For each, we measured the angle between the end-effector and the shaft in proportion to the articulating force using a push-pull gauge. Two fixed-position configurations of the instruments were predetermined: the neutral and the fully articulated positions. The forces required to secure surgical ties for the ureter, renal artery, and renal vein were evaluated using kidneys harvested from a female pig. RESULTS The bending forces required to bend from the neutral position to 30 were 5.6  1.2 and 4.7  1.0 N with the Laparo-Angle and RealHand, respectively. Furthermore, the slippage forces in the fully articulated state were 1.8  0.3, 1.6  0.2, and 1.5  0.2 N in the above order.

Vaccination is a safe and effective method of prevention against many infectious diseases, including COVID\\\\19. Here we investigate the strategies for national COVID\\\\19 vaccination programmes across central and eastern Europe and the inclusion of PLWH in vaccination programmes. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group consists of experts in the field of infectious diseases from 24 countries in the region. Between 1 November 2020 and 19 March 2021 the group proceeded an on\\\\line survey consisting of 20 questions. RESULTS: Twenty\\\\two countries (out of 24 invited) participated in the survey and 20/22 countries in the period between December 2020 and March 2021 had already started their COVID\\\\19 vaccination programme. In total, seven different vaccines were used by participating countries. In 17/21 countries (81%), vaccinated persons were centralized within the national registry. In 8/21 countries (38%) PLWH were prioritized for vaccination (the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Montenegro, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) and the Czech Republic, Greece and Serbia had put in place national guidelines for vaccination of PLWH. In 14/20 countries (70%) vaccination was only provided by designated centres. Eighteen respondents (18/21; 85.7%) reported that they planned to follow up HIV patients vaccinated against COVID\\\\19, mainly by measuring antibody levels and checking COVID\\\\19 incidence (11/21; 52.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey\\\\based study suggests that there are significant differences in terms of prioritizing PLWH, the types of vaccines used, vaccination coverage, and the development and implementation of a vaccination programmes within the region. Regardless of heterogenicity and existing barriers within the region, systematic vaccination in PLWH should have the highest priority, especially in those with severe immunodeficiency, risk factors, and in the elderly, aiming for prompt and high vaccination coverage.","output":"National strategies for vaccination against COVID\\\\19 in people living with HIV in Central and Eastern European region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public health consequences of the conflict in Iraq will likely continue after the violence has subsided. Reestablishing public health security will require large investments in infrastructure and the creation of effective systems of governance. On the question of governance, the allocation of powers in the new constitution of Iraq is critical. Given the ease with which public health threats cross borders, the constitution needs to grant to the federal government the legal authority to manage such threats and simultaneously meet international requirements. Unfortunately, the draft constitution does not accomplish this objective. If politically possible, the constitution should be amended to provide the federal government with this authority. If not possible, the Iraqi federal government would have two options. It could attempt to use alternative constitutional powers, such as national security powers. This option would be contentious and the results uncertain. Alternatively, the federal government could attempt to establish collaborative relationships with regional governments. Residual sectarian tensions create potential problems for this option, however. Reflecting on the Iraqi situation, we conclude that other federalizing countries emerging from conflict should ensure that their constitutions provide the federal government with the necessary authority to manage threats to public health security effectively.","output":"Establishing public health security in a postwar Iraq: constitutional obstacles and lessons for other federalizing states."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in South Korea has affected the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up protocols of various cancers. This study investigated the patterns of delaying surgery for breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea and evaluated factors that may have affected the decision to delay surgery. Methods: From February 18 to April 18, 2020, which was the critical period for COVID-19 in South Korea, patients with breast cancer who were scheduled for surgery were evaluated in terms of their decision in delaying the procedure. The patients were divided into two groups: delaying and non-delaying surgery groups. The association between personal and clinicopathological factors and delaying surgery was evaluated. Results: In patients belonging to the delaying surgery group, the mean delay period was 15.9 (standard deviation [SD], 10.9) days. Patients in the non-delaying surgery group were relatively younger (p = 0.003), single (p = 0.038), had planned mastectomy (p = 0.041), received needle biopsy for diagnosis (p = 0.021), and had a higher clinical N stage (p = 0.049) and multifocal lesions of breast cancer (p = 0.020). However, there were no significant differences in terms of the pathological T and N stages between the two groups. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was no occurrence of nosocomial infection in the non-delaying surgery group and no statistical difference in pathological stage between the delaying and non-delaying surgery groups. Although patients in the delaying surgery group tended to be relatively older and married and had planned small-scale surgery with a good prognosis of breast cancer, the prognosis did not appear to have changed whether delaying or proceeding with surgery for breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Patterns of Delaying Surgery for Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Daegu, South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the nurses' feelings regarding the safe disassembly of mechanical ventilators used in patients with Covid-19 inside the intensive care unit.

In response to this disease, social distancing has been identified as an important means to reduce the potential for transmission of the disease. To this end, federal and local governments around the world have introduced stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on travel to non-essential businesses. Preliminary evidence suggests substantial variability in the impacts of these orders in the United States, both across states and over time. This study examines this issue using daily county-level vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) data for the 48 continental U.S. states and the District of Columbia. A two-way random effects model is estimated to assess changes in VMT from March 1 to June 30, 2020 as compared to baseline January travel levels. The introduction of stay-at-home orders was shown to significantly reduce VMT, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic. However, over time, these effects were shown to dissipate, which may be attributable to quarantine fatigue. Many of the stay-at-home orders were lifted, in whole or in part, and travel was also shown to be lower when restrictions were in place on certain non-essential businesses, particularly those related to retail and personal care. Travel was also lower in those areas where higher numbers of COVID-19 cases were reported, regardless of the status of such restrictions. Traffic levels also varied with respect to other characteristics, including median income, political leanings, and how rural the county was in nature.","output":"Examining Impacts of COVID-19 Related Stay-at-Home Orders through a Two-way Random Effects Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Changes in speech, language, and episodic and semantic memory are documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) years before routine diagnosis. Aims: Develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system detecting amyloid-confirmed prodromal and preclinical AD from speech collected remotely via participants' smartphones. Method: A convenience sample of 133 participants with established amyloid beta and clinical diagnostic status (66 A{beta} +, 67 A{beta} -; 71 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 62 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD) completed clinical assessments for the AMYPRED study (NCT04828122). Participants completed optional remote assessments daily for 7-8 days, including the Automatic Story Recall Task (ASRT), a story recall paradigm with short and long variants, and immediate and delayed recall phases. Vector-based representations from each story source and transcribed retelling were produced using ParaBLEU, a paraphrase evaluation model. Representations were fed into logistic regression models trained with tournament leave-pair-out cross-validation analysis, predicting A{beta} status and MCI/mild AD within the full sample and A{beta} status in clinical diagnostic subsamples. Findings: At least one full remote ASRT assessment was completed by 115 participants (mean age=69.6 (range 54-80); 63 female/52 male; 66 CU and 49 MCI/mild AD, 56 A{beta} + and 59 A{beta} -). Using an average of 2.7 minutes of automatically transcribed speech from immediate recall of short stories, the AI system predicted MCI/mild AD in the full sample (AUC=0.85 +/- 0.08), and amyloid in MCI/mild AD (AUC=0.73 +/- 0.14) and CU subsamples (AUC=0.71 +/- 0.13). Amyloid classification within the full sample was no better than chance (AUC=0.57 +/- 0.11). Broadly similar results were reported for manually transcribed data, long ASRTs and delayed recall. Interpretation: Combined with advanced AI language models, brief, remote speech-based testing offers simple, accessible and cost-effective screening for early stage AD.

Regression analyses indicate that authoritarian countries do not necessarily tend to have fewer COVID-19 deaths than their democratic counterparts after controlling for other factors, especially data transparency. The transparency variable itself, on the other hand, is positively correlated with the number of death cases more consistently (P <0.05).

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I 2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.

This association might be related to an impairment of cerebral autoregulation, which normally maintains cerebral blood flow independent of arterial blood pressure variations. METHODS Patients aged 30-55, fulfilling ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine with aura, were prospectively enrolled and compared with gender- and age-matched healthy controls without a history of migraine. Patients and controls with a history of stroke or any disease potentially impairing cerebral autoregulation were excluded. We assessed cerebral autoregulation with two different methods: Transfer function analysis, and the correlation coefficient index Mx. The transfer function phase and gain reflect responses of cerebral blood flow velocities to relatively fast fluctuations of arterial blood pressure, whereas Mx also reflects responses to slower arterial blood pressure fluctuations. RESULTS A total of 22 migraine with aura patients (median age [IQR]: 39.5 [12.5] years) and 22 controls (39 [9.75] years) were included. Transfer function parameters and Mx were not different between patients and controls. However, Mx was inversely correlated with age in patients ( = -0.567, p = 0.006) and not in controls ( = -0.084, p = 0.509). Mx was also inversely correlated with migraine with aura duration ( = -0.617, p = 0.002), suggesting improvement of cerebral autoregulation efficiency with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral autoregulation did not differ between patients and controls aged 30-55. However, cerebral autoregulation efficiency was strongly correlated with migraine with aura duration. Further studies in younger patients are needed to determine whether cerebral autoregulation is impaired early in the course of disease.

A well-functioning primary care system is crucial in epidemic situations as it plays an important role in the development of a system-wide response. METHODS: 2,187 Austrian and German GPs answered an internet survey on preparedness, testing, staff protection, perception of risk, self-confidence, a decrease in the number of patient contacts, and efforts to control the spread of the virus in the practice during the early phase of the COVID-pandemic (3rd to 30th April). RESULTS: The completion rate of the questionnaire was high (90.9%). GPs gave low ratings to their preparedness for a pandemic, testing of suspected cases and efforts to protect staff. The provision of information to GPs and the perception of risk were rated as moderate. On the other hand, the participants rated their self-confidence, a decrease in patient contacts and their efforts to control the spread of the disease highly. CONCLUSION: Primary care is an important resource for dealing with a pandemic like COVID-19. The workforce is confident and willing to take an active role, but needs to be provided with the appropriate surrounding conditions. This will require that certain conditions are met.

As the pandemic evolves there is limited understanding of a potential association between symptomatic viral infection and age. To date, there is no knowledge of the role children (prepubescent, ages 9-13 years) play as silent vectors of the virus, with themselves being asymptomatic. Throughout different time frames and geographic locations, the current evidence on COVID-19 suggests that children are becoming infected at a significantly lower rate than other age groupsas low as 1%. Androgens upregulate the protease TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease-2), which facilitates efficient virus-host cell fusion with the epithelium of the lungs, thus increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of severe COVID-19. Owing to low levels of steroid hormones, prepubertal children may have low expression of TMPRSS2, thereby limiting the viral entry into host cells. As the world anticipates a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the role of prepubescent children as vectors transmitting the virus must be interrogated to prepare for a potential resurgence of COVID-19. This review discusses the current evidence on the low incidence of COVID-19 in children and the effect of sex-steroid hormones on SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and clinical outcomes of pediatric patients. On reopening society at large, schools will need to implement heightened health protocols with the knowledge that children as the silent viral transmitters can significantly affect the adult populations.","output":"The Resilient Child: Sex-Steroid Hormones and COVID-19 Incidence in Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate and differences among various COVID-19 prevention primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in China and understand their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are helpful to provide important suggestions to further improve national COVID-19 vaccination rate. DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was designed and conducted among COVID-19 prevention and control management teams at PHC facilities in mainland China. In the self-designed questionnaires, each subject was asked to evaluate on a 1C10 scale (10=extremely important/acceptable/influential) the COVID-19 vaccination importance, acceptance and factors related to vaccine hesitancy. SETTING: Subjects from 31 provinces and autonomous regions including minorities across mainland China were invited to complete the questionnaire between 22 February 2021 and 2 March 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Were selected by multistage stratified sampling, 998 valid questionnaires (valid rate 99.11%) were collected. The respondents were divided into group A (5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(1)=718) and group B (>5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(2)=280). OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey on vaccination rate and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine included the following: (1) if the subjects think the vaccination is important in containment of COVID-19 pandemic (1C10 scale, 10=extremely important), (2) if they would accept COVID-19 vaccine (1C10 scale, 10=extremely acceptable) and (3) their opinions on 7 factors possibly related to vaccine hesitancy (1C10 scale, 10=extremely influential). All the items were designed based on the previous expert interviews. RESULTS: Our results showed vaccination rate was greater in group A (85.93%) than in group B (66.43%) (p<0.001). Detailed analyses revealed that in group A, male members were twice as likely to get vaccinated as compared with female members (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.07; 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.43, p=0.004). In group B, those who were at or under the median age had twice the odds of vaccination coverage compared with those who were over the median age (aOR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.33, p=0.010). In addition, those who were specialised in traditional Chinese medicine were less likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those who were specialised in general medicine, with the aOR: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.83, p=0.033). By analysing the factors that influenced the vaccination attitudes among the 998 respondents, we found no significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. However, further detailed analyses found that team members with undergraduate college education were less likely to score higher in COVID-19 vaccination importance than those with technical secondary school education (aOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.93, p=0.035); Furthermore, those with non-medical job titles had nearly twice the odds of giving a higher score for the uncertainty of vaccine efficacy compared with those with junior medical titles (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.016). Team members with a non-medical title were more likely to give a higher score for advice on social sources compared with those with a junior medical title (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.042). CONCLUSION: In PHC facilities, although there was a higher COVID-19 vaccination rate among COVID-19 prevention and control teams, some subgroups with different descriptive characters showed negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Because primary care workers in China are highly expected to receive the vaccination, and support and educate the public for COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, it is important and necessary to continue to educate them about their vaccination concerns and change their attitudes towards vaccination. Our findings are highly beneficial for designing public vaccination education strategies.","output":"Vaccination coverage among COVID-19 prevention and control management teams at primary healthcare facilities in China and their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine: a cross-sectional online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30304-0.].","output":"Correction to Lancet Rheumatol 2020; published online Aug 21. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30304-0"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiology characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) cases in Hainan were collected and analyzed for providing next stage control and prevention strategy in next stage Spatial and temporal distribution, population characteristic, cluster, the interval between onset, visiting clinic, admitted were analyzed Local cases and severe cases were also included in the analysis Result showed that a total of 168 confirmed cases, including 36 severe cases and 5 fatal cases were reported Cases were mainly distributed in Haikou, Sanya etc tourism cities and counties The first case occurred in Jan 13th and the epidemic peak occurred in Jan 24th Since Feb 6th, onset of illness has declined The male-to-female ratio was 0 9:1 The median age was 51 years Cases older than 50 years accounted for 54 8% Retirees accounted for 36 9%, which was highest in all cases Since Feb, the proportion of local cases rose dramatically The period from onset to visiting clinic (OTV), from first visiting clinic to diagnosis (VTF), from onset to diagnosis (OTD) and from onset to be admitted (OTA) was longer in local cases than imported cases Median age and the percentage of underlying diseases of severe/extreme cases were higher than mild/ordinary cases OTV of severe/extreme cases was longer than mild/ordinary cases, while for VTF, the former was shorter than latter The epidemic was divided into three stages Most of cases in the first stage were imported cases, while in the second stage most of cases were local cases There were few cases in the third stages We should strengthen personal protection and health monitoring for people in service industry, isolate the close contacts, and carry out publicity and education to raise the awareness of medical treatment for people, especially for old people Clinical doctors should monitor the state of the patients older than 60 years and with underlying diseases We should step up epidemic monitoring prevention and control measure for people return from holiday and immigrant to consolidate the effects of prevention and control work","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Hainan Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of South Africans utilise primary healthcare services (either in the state or private sector) for mental health concerns; hence, there is a need to objectively assess these doctors attitudes and knowledge of mental illness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 435 suspicious cases with COVID-19 which were recorded from the Imam Khomeini Hospital database between May 9, 2020 and December 20, 2020, have been taken into consideration. The Chi-square method was used to determine the most important features in diagnosing the COVID-19; eight selected data mining algorithms including multilayer perceptron (MLP), J-48, Bayesian Net (Bayes Net), logistic regression, K-star, random forest, Ada-boost, and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) were applied in data mining. Finally, the most appropriate diagnostic model for COVID-19 was obtained based on comparing the performance of the selected algorithms. RESULTS: As the result of using the Chi-square method, 21 variables were identified as the most important diagnostic criteria in COVID-19.

Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have pneumonia concomitant with local inflammation and sometimes a cytokine storm. Specific components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus trigger lung inflammation, and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs exacerbates this process, although much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study of lung type II pneumocyte cells (A549) demonstrated that ORF7, an open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, induced the production of CCL2, a chemokine that promotes the chemotaxis of monocytes, and decreased the expression of IL-8, a chemokine that recruits neutrophils. A549 cells also had an increased level of IL-6. The results of our chemotaxis transwell assay suggested that ORF7 augmented monocyte infiltration and reduced the number of neutrophils. We conclude that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 may have specific effects on the immunological changes in tissues after infection.

It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, have appropriate training, do not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, have continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, motivation of medical students must be evaluated in order to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate motivation of medical students to be part of the health team to help in the COVID19 pandemic. Methods and Findings: We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students perceptions about participating in care of patients with suspected infection due to coronavirus during the COVID19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) individual characteristics, year and geographic location of medical school; b) twenty eight statements responded on a 5 point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings of a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyse the data. Statements with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in COVID19 pandemic were related to sense of purpose or duty (It is the duty of the medical student to put himself at the service of the population in the pandemic), altruism (I am willing to take risks by participating in practical in the context of pandemic), perception of good performance and professional identity (I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic). Males had higher odds ratios than females (1.36 [95% CI: 1.24 to 1.49] to 1.68 [95% CI: 1.47 to 1.91]).

Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoofs Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE) framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens.","output":"How does a (Smart) Age-Friendly Ecosystem Look in a Post-Pandemic Society?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: : The severe disruptions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have necessitated a redistribution of resources to meet hospitals current service needs during this pandemic. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic, and its corresponding State of Emergency, on a tertiary traumatology emergency service. METHODS: : An observational study was performed at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Four different periods were studied, including the first 20 days of Spain's current State of Emergency, from March 14 to April 02, 2020 (Period 4). This period was compared to the 20-day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2). A total of 6,565 patient visits were analyzed: 1909 in Period 1 (29.1%), 2161 in Period 2 (32.9%), 1983 in Period 3 (30.2%), and 512 in Period 4 (7.8%). Variables collected included patient age and sex, insurance type, discharge destination and reason for hospital admission. RESULTS: : The patients mean age was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation (SD): 22.1), and 51.8% were women (3495/6565). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in total visits to the trauma emergency department, workplace accidents, traffic accidents and number of hospital admissions, particularly during Period 4. However, no statistically-significant differences were found in the number of osteoporotic hip fractures admitted between the four periods. The numbers of hospital admissions for osteoporotic hip fracture were 42 during Period 1, 41 during Period 2, 43 during Period 3 and 36 during Period 4. CONCLUSIONS: : While most traumatological presentations decreased in frequency over the course of the outbreak, the number of osteoporotic hip fractures remained stable. Thus, contingency plans in times of crisis need to be carefully targeted, and to keep in mind certain public health issues that do not decrease, despite a State of Emergency, like osteoporotic hip fractures.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on an Emergency Traumatology Service: Experience at a Tertiary Trauma Centre in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the unmet need for timely accurate diagnosis and prognosis of acute infections and sepsis, host-immune-response-based tests are being developed to help clinicians make more informed decisions including prescribing antimicrobials, ordering additional diagnostics, and assigning level of care. One such test (InSep?, Inflammatix, Inc.) uses a 29-mRNA panel to determine the likelihood of bacterial infection, the separate likelihood of viral infection, and the risk of physiologic decompensation (severity of illness). The test, being implemented in a rapid point-of-care platform with a turnaround time of 30 min, enables accurate and rapid diagnostic use at the point of impact. In this report, we provide details on how the 29-biomarker signature was chosen and optimized, together with its molecular, immunological, and medical significance to better understand the pathophysiological relevance of altered gene expression in disease. We synthesize key results obtained from gene-level functional annotations, geneset-level enrichment analysis, pathway-level analysis, and gene-network-level upstream regulator analysis. Emerging findings are summarized as hallmarks on immune cell interaction, inflammatory mediators, cellular metabolism and homeostasis, immune receptors, intracellular signaling and antiviral response; and converging themes on neutrophil degranulation and activation involved in immune response, interferon, and other signaling pathways.","output":"The Optimization and Biological Significance of a 29-Host-Immune-mRNA Panel for the Diagnosis of Acute Infections and Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood donor genetics and lifestyle affect the quality of red blood cell (RBC) storage. Heterozygotes for beta-thalassaemia (Thal+) constitute a non-negligible proportion of blood donors in the Mediterranean and other geographical areas. The unique haematological profile of Thal+ could affect capacity of enduring storage stress, however, the storability of Thal+ RBCs is largely unknown. In this study, RBCs from 18 Thal+ donors were stored in the cold and profiled for primary (haemolysis) and secondary (phosphatidylserine exposure, potassium leakage, oxidative stress) quality measures, and metabolomics, versus sex- and age-matched controls. The Thal+ units exhibited better levels of storage haemolysis and susceptibility to lysis following osmotic, oxidative and mechanical insults. Moreover, Thal+ RBCs had a lower percentage of surface removal signaling, reactive oxygen species and oxidative defects to membrane components at late stages of storage. Lower potassium accumulation and higher urate-dependent antioxidant capacity were noted in the Thal+ supernatant. Full metabolomics analyses revealed alterations in purine and arginine pathways at baseline, along with activation of pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis upstream to pyruvate kinase in Thal+ RBCs. Upon storage, substantial changes were observed in arginine, purine and vitamin B6 metabolism, as well as in the hexosamine pathway. A high degree of glutamate generation in Thal+ RBCs was accompanied by low levels of purine oxidation products (IMP, hypoxanthine, allantoin). The Thal mutations impact the metabolism and the susceptibility to haemolysis of stored RBCs, suggesting good post-transfusion recovery. However, haemoglobin increment and other clinical outcomes of Thal+ RBC transfusion deserve elucidation by future studies.","output":"-thalassemia minor is a beneficial determinant of red blood cell storage lesion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic threat posed by responses to COVID 19 endangers financing for long-term care across the states that is already inadequate and inequitable. Increasing the federal share of Medicaid spending as unemployment rises would mitigate fiscal pressure on states and preserve public services. But unlike the demand for Medicaid's health care protections, which rises when economic activity declines, the demand for long-term care protections will grow even in a healthy economy as the population ages. Enhanced federal support is urgent not only to cope with the virus today but also to meet the long-term care needs of the nation's aging population in the years to come. Long-term care financing policy should be modified to either adjust federal matching funds by the age of each state's population, or fully federalize the funding of LTC expenses of Medicaid beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicare.","output":"COVID-19 and the Future of Long-Term Care: The Urgency of Enhanced Federal Financing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In a few patients with mild COVID-19, there is a possibility of the infection becoming severe or critical in the future This work aims to identify high-risk patients who have a high probability of changing from mild to critical COVID-19 (only account for 5% of cases) Methods: Using traditional convolutional neural networks for classification may not be suitable to identify this 5% of high-risk patients from an entire dataset due to the highly imbalanced label distribution To address this problem, we propose a Mix Contrast (MixCo) model, which matches original features with mixed features for contrastive learning Three modules are proposed for training MixCo: 1) a cumulative learning strategy for synthesizing the mixed feature;2) a commutative feature combination module for learning the commutative law of feature concatenation;3) a united pairwise loss assigning adaptive weights for sample pairs with different class anchors based on their current optimization status Results: We collect a multi-center computed tomography dataset including 918 confirmed COVID-19 patients from four hospitals and evaluate the proposed method on both the COVID-19 mild-to-critical prediction and COVID-19 diagnosis tasks For mild-to-critical prediction, the experimental results show a recall of 0 80 and a specificity of 0 815 For diagnosis, the model shows comparable results with deep neural networks using a large dataset Our method demonstrates improvements when the amount of training data is small or imbalanced Significance: Identifying mild-to-critical COVID-19 patients is important for early prevention and personalized treatment planning","output":"Mix Contrast for COVID-19 Mild-to-critical Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, appears exceptional in its virulence and immunopathology. In some patients, the resulting hyperinflammation resembles a cytokine release syndrome. Our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 is evolving and anti-cytokine therapies are under active investigation. This narrative review summarizes existing knowledge of the immune response to coronavirus infection and highlights the current and potential future roles of therapeutic strategies to combat the hyperinflammatory response of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Data Sources: Relevant and up-to-date literature, media reports, and author experiences were included from Medline, national newspapers, and public clinical trial databases. Study Selection: The authors selected studies for inclusion by consensus. Data Extraction: The authors reviewed each study and selected approrpriate data for inclusion through consensus. Data Synthesis: Hyperinflammation, reminiscent of cytokine release syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, appears to drive outcomes among adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019. Cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, appear to contribute importantly to such systemic hyperinflammation. Ongoing clinical trials will determine the efficacy and safety of anti-cytokine therapies in coronavirus disease 2019. In the interim, anti-cytokine therapies may provide a treatment option for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 unresponsive to standard critical care management, including ventilation.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1-6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF-&#945; responses than poly I:C of < 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN? nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN? binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1? and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.","output":"Double stranded RNA drives anti-viral innate immune responses, sickness behavior and cognitive dysfunction dependent on dsRNA length, IFNAR1 expression and age"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/57.md","filePath":"drive/57.md"}'),R={name:"drive/57.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
