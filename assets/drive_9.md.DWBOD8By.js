Manipulation of genes in the GH/IGF1 family in animals started in 1982 when the first GH transgenic mice were produced. Since then, multiple laboratories have altered mouse DNA to globally disrupt Gh, Ghr, and other genes upstream or downstream of GH or its receptor. The ability to stay current with the various genetically manipulated mouse lines within the realm of GH/IGF1 research has been daunting. As such, this review attempts to consolidate and summarize the literature related to the initial characterization of many of the known gene-manipulated mice relating to the actions of GH, PRL and IGF1. We have organized the mouse lines by modifications made to constituents of the GH/IGF1 family either upstream or downstream of GHR or to the GHR itself. Available data on the effect of altered gene expression on growth, GH/IGF1 levels, body composition, reproduction, diabetes, metabolism, cancer, and aging are summarized. For the ease of finding this information, key words are highlighted in bold throughout the main text for each mouse line and this information is summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Numerous cancer patients from non-Western countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), seek cancer care outside their home countries and many are sponsored by their governments for treatment. Many patients interrupted their cancer treatment abruptly and so returned to their home countries with unique challenges. In this review we will discuss practical challenges and recommendations for all cancer patients returning to their home countries from treatment abroad. METHOD: Experts from medical, surgical and other cancer subspecialties in the UAE were invited to form a taskforce to address challenges and propose recommendations for patients returning home from abroad after medical tourism during the SARS-COV-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: The taskforce which consisted of experts from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, radiology and palliative care summarized the current challenges and suggested a practical approaches to address these specific challenges to improve the returning cancer patients care. Lack of medical documentation, pathology specimens and radiology images are one of the major limitations on the continuation of the cancer care for returning patients. Difference in approaches and treatment recommendations between the existing treating oncologists abroad and receiving oncologists in the UAE regarding the optimal management which can be addressed by early and empathic communications with patients and by engaging the previous treating oncologists in treatment planning based on the available resources and expertise in the UAE. Interruption of curative radiotherapy (RT) schedules which can potentially increase risk of treatment failure has been a major challenge, RT dose-compensation calculation should be considered in these circumstances. CONCLUSION: The importance of a thorough clinical handover cannot be overstated and regulatory bodies are needed to prevent what can be considered unethical procedure towards returning cancer patients with lack of an effective handover. Clear communication is paramount to gain the trust of returning patients and their families. This pandemic may also serve as an opportunity to encourage patients to receive treatment locally in their home country. Future studies will be needed to address the steps to retain cancer patients in the UAE rather than seeking cancer treatment abroad.","output":"Challenges for cancer patients returning home during SARS-COV-19 pandemic after medical tourism - a consensus report by the emirates oncology task force"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: In the age of big data, the amount of scientific information available online dwarfs the ability of current tools to support researchers in locating and securing access to the necessary materials. Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. RESULTS: A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news.

Reducing blood loss so that bloodless surgery can be performed may help minimize morbidity and length of stay. As patients, hospital administrators, and government regulators desire less invasive procedures, the surgical technical challenge is increasing. More operations are being performed through minimally invasive incisions with laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic approaches. In this setting, tools that can reduce bleeding by causing blood to clot, sealing vessels, or gluing tissues are gaining an increasing importance. Thus, hemostats, sealants, and adhesives are becoming a more important element of surgical practice. This review is designed to facilitate the reader's basic knowledge of these tools so that informed choices are made for controlling bleeding in specific clinical situations. Such information is useful for all members of the operative team. The team includes surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents, and nurses as well as hematologists and other medical specialists who may be involved in the perioperative care of surgical patients. An understanding of these therapeutic options may also be helpful to the transfusion service. In some cases, these materials may be stored in the blood bank, and their appropriate use may reduce demand for other transfusion components.

The objective of this article is to look at how the pandemic has affected credit and degree mobility students from inside and outside Europe, focusing on the example of Portugal during the lockdown of Spring 2020. Using evidence from qualitative interviews, we illustrate the unfolding impact of the pandemic on the lives and learning habits of these students, showing how the international learning experience changed from being a relatively positive and carefree experience to one characterized by risk and uncertainty. This apparent inversion extends to a potential devaluation of their mobility capital, somewhat undermining the raison dtre of much student mobility. In conclusion, we argue that whether temporary or permanent, during the pandemic we have witnessed a turn towards immobility in tertiary education, and perhaps in the broader field of mobilities, creating an imperative to open up debate on the impact of the limitations that affect student mobilities.

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence followed by an RNA structure motif that stimulates frameshifting. This motif is commonly assumed to be a simple stemCloop for HIV-1. In this study, we show that the frameshift stimulatory signal is more complex than believed and consists of a two-stem helix. The upper stemCloop corresponds to the classic stemCloop, and the lower stem is formed by pairing the spacer region following the slippery sequence and preceding this classic stemCloop with a segment downstream of this stemCloop. A three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. This structure was suggested by enzymatic probing with nuclease V1 of an RNA fragment corresponding to the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1. The involvement of the novel lower stem in frameshifting was supported by site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment encompassing the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1 was inserted in the beginning of the coding sequence of a reporter gene coding for the firefly luciferase, such that expression of luciferase requires a C1 frameshift. When the reporter was expressed in COS cells, mutations that disrupt the capacity to form the lower stem reduced frameshifting, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of this stem restored the frameshift efficiency near wild-type level.

METHODS Implementation of a single-institution MDC TH platform to perform patient visits on February 1, 2020 was studied. Following 6 months of implementation, TH visits' characteristics were compared with IP visits in the 3 months before implementation by patient volume, length of clinic visits, and patient satisfaction survey results. RESULTS Before implementation, 152 (100%) of clinic visits were IP. During the implementation, 87 (37.7%) were TH visits. Seventy-four (49%) were MDC visits, 17 (23%) of these using the TH platform. Each TH visit's median length was 25 minutes (IQR 15-30), while the median length of IP visits was 45 minutes (IQR 30-45).

Our extensive numerical results demonstrate strong threshold behavior near the estimated basic reproduction number, suggesting that the necessary conditions for stochastic stability are close to the sufficient conditions derived. Furthermore, we found that increasing the noise level slightly reduces the final proportion of infected individuals. In addition, we analyze COVID-19 data from various regions worldwide and demonstrate that by changing only a few parameter values, our sSEIHR model can accurately describe both the general trend and the random fluctuations in the number of daily new cases in each region, allowing governments and hospitals to make more accurate caseload predictions using fewer compartments and parameters than other comparable stochastic compartmental models.","output":"A stochastic SEIHR model for COVID-19 data fluctuations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we present a methodology to define the origin of SARS-CoV-2 variants as exemplified by defining the introduction of the B.1.429 variant in Hawaii.

Conclusion: Study concludes that the chest CT finding results of selected studies for Covid and pneumonia cases were overlapping. Only high prevalence related to upper and lower lobe involvement and peripheral distribution was relatively high in Covid studies.","output":"Comparison of High Resolution Computed Tomography Features in Covid-19 and Other Viral Pneumonia- A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Mild, subacute COVID-19 in young people show inflammatory enhancement, but normal pulmonary function. Inflammatory markers are associated with age and male sex, whereas clinical symptoms are associated with age and female sex, but not with objective disease markers. Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is widespread among adolescents and young adults across the globe. The present study aimed to compare inflammatory markers, pulmonary function and clinical symptoms across non-hospitalized, 12 C 25 years old COVID-19 cases and non-COVID-19 controls, and to investigate associations between inflammatory markers, clinical symptoms, pulmonary function and background variables in the COVID-19 group. Methods The present paper presents baseline data from an ongoing longitudinal observational cohort study (Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 in Adolescents, LoTECA, ClinicalTrials ID: NCT04686734). A total of 31 plasma cytokines and complement activation products were assayed by multiplex and ELISA methodologies. Pulmonary function and clinical symptoms were investigated by spirometry and questionnaires, respectively. Results A total of 405 COVID-19 cases and 111 non-COVID-19 controls were included. The COVID-19 group had significantly higher plasma levels of IL-1, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, TNF, IP-10, eotaxin, GM-CSF, bFGF, complement TCC and C3bc, and significantly lower levels of IL-13 and MIP-1, as compared to controls. Spirometry did not detect any significant differences across the groups. IL-4, IL-7, TNF and eotaxin were negatively associated with female sex;eotaxin and IL-4 were positively associated with age. Clinical symptoms were positively associated with female sex and age, but not with objective disease markers. Conclusions Among non-hospitalized adolescents and young adults with COVID-19 there was significant alterations of plasma inflammatory markers in the subacute stage of the infection. Still, pulmonary function was normal. Clinical symptoms were independent of inflammatory and pulmonary function markers, but positively associated with age and female sex.","output":"Inflammatory Markers, Pulmonary Function, and Clinical Symptoms in Acute COVID-19 Among Non-Hospitalized Adolescents and Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various technology applications have been used in the teaching and learning process as a medium in the COVID-19 pandemic era to make the learning process easier.

To reduce the risk of infection, Belgian government ordered restrictive isolation measures. If lockdown and social isolation have proven to be quite effective in terms of physical health, little is known about the impact of the lockdown on couple and parental satisfaction. The current study concerned the first wave of a 5-wave longitudinal research programme relative to the trajectory of couple and parental satisfaction around the lockdown (N = 779 individuals) on 3 cohorts based on the government announcements (i.e. beginning of the lockdown and subsequent extended lockdowns). The objective was to compare the level of couple and parental satisfaction during the strict first lockdown in Belgium with normative values, considering any gender, parenting, and cohabitation differences. Participants were invited to complete four scales of the Marital Satisfaction Inventory Revised, i.e. Global Distress, Difficulties in Problem-solving Communication, Aggression, and Conflicts over Children Rearing. Two main findings emerged from the study. First, our results showed more couple satisfaction during the lockdown, in comparison to normative situations. During the lockdown, partners expressed more general couple satisfaction. They also felt more effective in resolving couple conflicts and in problem-solving communication and they experienced less couple physical and verbal aggression. Second, higher levels of conflicts over children rearing between partners during the lockdown were observed, in comparison to normative situations. However, major gender differences were observed: While mothers assessed more parental conflicts during the lockdown in comparison to normative situations, fathers reported less conflicts. Finally, our results showed gender differences in parental satisfaction between the three cohorts: Mothers expressed more parental conflicts over children rearing after the first extension of the lockdown in comparison to the beginning of the lockdown while no differences were observed in fathers. The discussion highlighted the positive aspects of lockdown for couples and the gender differences relative to the satisfaction over children rearing.","output":"How Do We Live Together During a Lockdown in Belgium?

Experts argue that feedback is critical for performance improvement, but the evidence is limited. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of face-to-face verbal feedback from a health professional, compared with alternative or no feedback, on the objective workplace task performance of another health professional. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We searched the full holdings of Ovid MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to 1 February 2019 and searched references of included studies. Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of feedback, in which health professionals were randomised to individual verbal face-to-face feedback compared with no feedback or alternative feedback and available as full-text publications in English. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach. For feedback compared with no feedback, outcome data from included studies were pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS In total, 26 trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 2307 participants. For the effect of verbal face-to-face feedback on performance compared with no feedback, when studies at high risk of bias were excluded, eight studies involving 392 health professionals were included in a meta-analysis: the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.7 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.03; p<0.001) in favour of feedback. The calculated SMD prediction interval was -0.06 to 1.46. For feedback compared with alternative feedback, studies could not be pooled due to substantial design and intervention heterogeneity. All included studies were summarised, and key factors likely to influence performance were identified including components within feedback interventions, instruction and practice opportunities. CONCLUSIONS Verbal face-to-face feedback in the health professions may result in a moderate to large improvement in workplace task performance, compared with no feedback. However, the quality of evidence was low, primarily due to risk of bias and publication bias. Further research is needed. In particular, we found a lack of high-quality trials that clearly reported key components likely to influence performance.

At the beginning of the 2020C2021 school year, the Spanish universities opted for face-to-face teaching. To that end, different special measures and adaptations were implemented in higher education facilities, aimed at minimizing the risk of infection and ensuring safe face-to-face learning. The objective was to explore and describe the level of fear of first-year students after the start of in-person classes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample was 185 first-year students who were evaluated on the first day of class. For that purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire was administered to collect demographic information and to find the level of fear and concern. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to assess the severity of the participants fear of the pandemic situation. Results: The results indicate that participating university population does not report fear of the virus, but they describe various psychosomatic characteristics, such as increased pulse rate and heart palpitations (p = 0.008) and insomnia (p = 0.05) when they think about infection with coronavirus. Nevertheless, when data are disaggregated by gender, we observe differences specifically in women (83.2%), such as fear (p = 0.006) and sweaty hands when they think of the virus (p = 0.023). Conclusions: Incoming university freshmen do not express concern or fear of potential infection with COVID-19, but they are concerned about family transmission after beginning face-to-face classes.","output":"Analysis of Fear Post COVID in First-Year Students after the Incorporation to the Classroom: Descriptive Study in University Students of Health Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes. In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-&#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both &#916;9-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of Cannabis sativa that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant.

Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies. AREAS COVERED: The main methodologies of serology-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on 31th December 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two weeks post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen.

In this study, we have examined the perspectives of Anganwadi workers (AWWs), the frontline workers of the Integrated Child Development Services, on working in convergence with the public health sector. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study was done between June 2018 and June 2019 in two urban informal settlements in Mumbai. We conducted in-depth interviews with 26 AWWs and their supervisors, purposively sampled and diversified in terms of age, education, and years of experience. We used the software NVivo version 12 to aid analysis. RESULTS: Most AWWs acknowledged that a convergent framework of action between nutrition and health was likely to be beneficial to the community. However, they also shared that cross-sector convergence was currently limited due to technical unfamiliarity with health-sector issues in the frontline, discomfort with data sharing, and lack of meaningful incentives for joint work. Broader organizational challenges such as poor infrastructure and lack of supervision, as well as challenges in the urban context (migration and cultural barriers) further hindered joint activities. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that critical structural gaps in the urban setup of ICDS need to be addressed and AWWs need to be better familiarized with the changing roles expected from them under POSHAN Abhiyaan. To work better with the health sector, the work timings of AWWs need to be aligned with those of the health sector and meaningful financial incentives need to be put in place for cross-sector activities.","output":"Implementing a convergent framework of action against childhood malnutrition in urban informal settlements of Mumbai: Frontline perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of asthma acquisition in adolescence and post-adolescence has been unknown.

To improve statistical power, we first screened CpGs based on associations of DNA methylation (DNAm) at an age of 10 years (pre-adolescence) with asthma acquisition at 10C18 years (during adolescence). A logistic regression with repeated measures was applied to CpGs that passed screening to examine the associations of pre-adolescence DNAm with asthma acquisition from 10C18 years and 18C26 years, with an interaction term to evaluate transition period specificity. Findings were further tested in an independent birth cohort, ALSPAC. In total, 205 CpGs (with 150 being females) showed associations with asthma acquisition (main or interaction effects) at FDR = 0.05 in IOWBC, of which 112 (90 being females) showed consistent associations in the ALSPAC. Genes that the identified CpGs were mapped to, e.g., AKAP1 and ENO1, have been shown to be associated with the risk of asthma.

The Family Stress Model (FSM) states that food insecurity potentially impacts adolescent psychosocial adjustment indirectly through its effects on parental psychological functioning and parenting. The current study examined data from the Children, Welfare, and Families study (N = 687, 53% female, M(age) of child at baseline = 11.74 years, SD = 1.39) to determine whether household food insecurity at the beginning of adolescence predicts later behavioral outcomes and whether that association is mediated through caregiver depression and caregiverCadolescent relationship quality. Caregivers completed measures of past-year household food insecurity, current self-reported depressive symptoms and adolescent behavior problems, while adolescents completed a measure of current caregiverCadolescent relationship quality. A serial multiple mediator model, controlling for baseline values of mediators, outcomes, and relevant demographic covariates, indicated a significant total indirect effect, whereas the total direct effect was not significant. Significant indirect effects through both caregiver depression and caregiverCadolescent relationship quality were also found. These results are the first to explicitly examine the FSM with respect to household food insecurity and to demonstrate the indirect effects of food insecurity on adolescent adjustment. The findings indicate the need to improve food security and address subsequent intra- and inter-personal difficulties among low-income families that contribute to behavioral problems among adolescents facing household food insecurity.","output":"Food Insecurity and Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment: Indirect Pathways through Caregiver Adjustment and CaregiverCAdolescent Relationship Quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smartphones can improve our lives, but also consume our lives. It is known that problematic mobile phone use, such as nomophobia, can lead to some mental health problems. So far, psychological factors behind nomophobia were yet to be fully discovered. Previous studies showed that individuals' adaptability was closely related to nomophobia. However, adaptability was a complex construct that contains various components, and it was unclear whether these components contributed equally to nomophobia. This study investigated 678 college students by using Chinese versions of the nomophobia questionnaire, mobile phone addiction tendency scale, and freshmen adaptability scale. Lasso regression was used to further explore the key factors that could affect nomophobia. Model results showed that the value of +1se was [0.303, 0.423] at the minimum mean squared error in the training data. Emotional adaptability significantly predicted the fear of being unable to access information ( = ?0.022, p < 0.001), losing convenience ( = ?0.067, p < 0.001), and losing Internet connection ( = ?0.003, p < 0.01) after +1se was included in the testing data, and the R(2) were 0.496, 0.483, and 0.493. Homesickness adaptability significantly predicted the fear of losing contact ( = ?0.056, p < 0.05), and R(2) was 0.508. In addition, similar results were obtained by using datasets of mobile phone addiction and adaptability. Therefore, we concluded that the emotional adaptability has an important effect on nomophobia.

In this study, we developed a high-content imaging (HCI) assay to measure DNA content and identify different phases of the cell cycle. We then investigated the potential effects of cell cycle arrest on Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Cells arrested in G1 phase by serum starvation or G1/S phase using aphidicolin or G2/M phase using nocodazole showed much reduced EBOV infection compared to the untreated control. Release of cells from serum starvation or aphidicolin block resulted in a time-dependent increase in the percentage of EBOV infected cells. The effect of EBOV infection on cell cycle progression was found to be cell-type dependent. Infection of asynchronous MCF-10A cells with EBOV resulted in a reduced number of cells in G2/M phase with concomitant increase of cells in G1 phase. However, these effects were not observed in HeLa or A549 cells. Together, our studies suggest that EBOV requires actively proliferating cells for efficient replication. Furthermore, multiplexing of HCI based assays to detect viral infection, cell cycle status and other phenotypic changes in a single cell population will provide useful information during screening campaigns using siRNA and small molecule therapeutics.","output":"High Content Image Based Analysis Identifies Cell Cycle Inhibitors as Regulators of Ebola Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human aldo-keto reductase 1C isoforms catalyze reduction of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including therapeutic drugs, and are associated with chemotherapy resistance.

Initial pathology is due to the virus binding to the ACE\\\\2 protein on endothelial cells lining blood vessels and entering these cells in order to replicate. Viral replication causes oxidative stress due to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Many (~60%) of the infected people appear to have eliminated the virus from their body after 28 days and resume normal activity. However, a significant proportion (~40%) experience a variety of symptoms (loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, cough, aching pain, brain fog, insomnia, shortness of breath, and tachycardia) after 12 weeks and are diagnosed with a syndrome named LONG COVID.

To achieve our study objective, we employed the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) approach to analyze the effect of renewable energy use, economic growth, political risk, and globalization on quantiles of carbon emissions. The study utilized dataset stretching between 1990 and 2018 to investigate this interrelationship in the BRICS nations. The results generated from the MMQR mimic those of the three heterogeneous linear panel estimation techniques conducted (for robustness check), in terms of coefficient sign, magnitude, and significance. Using the MMQR technique, empirical results show that across quantiles (0.1C0.90), political risk, economic growth, and globalization positively affects environmental degradation. Renewable energy consumption, on the other hand, curb environmental degradation across all quantiles (0.10C0.90). Furthermore, the outcomes of the FMOLS, DOLS, and FEOLS corroborated the MMQR outcomes. In addition, the outcomes of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality revealed that renewable energy use, political risk, economic growth, and globalization can significantly predict CO(2) emissions in the BRICS nations. The findings offer intuition for policymakers to lessen CO(2) emissions in BRICS nations via diversification and clean energy technologies such as carbon capture and storage.","output":"Does political risk drive environmental degradation in BRICS countries?

The disease presents with a viral prodrome, followed by psychiatric manifestations. In the next phase, movement disorders or/and seizures occur. Finally, in the last phase, there is a decrease in the level of consciousness. Central hypoventilation and autonomic dysfunction can occur. Recently a unique EEG (electroencephalogram) pattern has been associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, the extreme delta brush (EDB). Although the association of the EDB with ANMDARE is known by the medical community, its significance is mainly unknown. A systematic review on NMDARE is also scarce. We decided to conduct a systematic review on this topic to consolidate the knowledge and establish the importance of the EDB as a prognostic factor. To conduct this systematic review, we used only studies conducted in humans, written in English, and published in the last 20 years. We used PubMed as a database and searched the following search terms: (\\"NMDA encephalitis\\"[Title/Abstract] AND \\"Epilepsy\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (NMDA encephalitis\\"[Title/Abstract] AND \\"seizures\\" [Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"NMDA encephalitis\\"[Title/Abstract] AND \\"extreme delta brush\\"[Title/Abstract]). The protocol used for this systematic review was the Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocol, and to analyze the bias of the studies, we used the ROBINS-1 tool. Eight studies were collected from our search strategy. Our data pulling showed that seizures were present in 178/249 (71.48%) patients. Status Epilepticus was reported in 29/96 (30.20%), and the EBD was seen in 30.89% (55/178) patients with seizures. The range of EDB was 5.9%-33% among the studies. Because the sample size was small, the statistical power was decreased. We had a low overall risk of bias. The wide range in the results could be related to the timing of the EEG recording. EDB was associated overall with increased length of hospital stay, increased ICU admission, and incidence of status epilepticus. The etiology of the EDB remains mainly unknown. However, it has been postulated that in NMDAR encephalitis, there is a disruption of the rhythmic neuronal activity. When antibodies block/target the NMDAR, the rhythmic neuronal activity is disrupted, leading to the unique EDB pattern. Another theory suggests that delta activity is caused because of focal abnormalities in the brain, and the superimposition of the beta waves is related to the alterations of the NMDA receptors.","output":"Understanding Seizures and Prognosis of the Extreme Delta Brush Pattern in Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) Receptor Encephalitis: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mass in Motion Municipal Wellness and Leadership initiative at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health provides local capacity to implement proven policies and practices creating environments supportive of healthy living, including food access efforts.

Pregnancy is a challenging period, and COVID-19 has added risk to women pregnant during the pandemic. AIM: The present study was aimed to assess the emotional difficulties in pregnant females who tested positive for COVID-19. The current study estimated the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among 63 pregnant ladies who tested positive for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in Child and Maternity Hospital of GMC Anantnag, Kashmir, India, from April to December 2020. A total of 63 pregnant females who tested positive for COVID-19 participated in the study. The COVID-positive pregnant ladies were interviewed in the outpatient department of the child and maternity clinic 2 weeks after the infection. The interview scale used was Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. The data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We found that the mean age of participants was 33.5  7.4. We found that 38.1% of the females had positive bad obstetric history. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 33.32%, 50.83%, and 60.3%, respectively. In correlation analysis, notably bad obstetric history and working females were significant independent factors for higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The depression was also found more in literate females and the third trimester. CONCLUSION: The study indicates high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnant females who tested positive for COVID-19. The emotional difficulties were found to be higher in educated and working females. The bad obstetric history was found to be an independent factor for higher levels of emotional difficulties in COVID-positive pregnant females.

Both mutations resulted in the same biochemical and molecular genetic phenotypes. Specifically, cybrids containing 100% mutated mtDNAs, but not those containing the corresponding wild-type mtDNAs, exhibited severe defects in respiratory chain activity, in the rates of protein synthesis, and in the steady-state levels of mitochondrial translation products. In addition, aberrant mitochondrial translation products were detected with both mutations. No significant alterations were observed in the processing of polycistronic RNA precursor transcripts derived from the region containing the tRNA(Lys) gene.

This paper reviews the origin, characteristics and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus and the preventive measures adopted by the world's nations to curb the effects of the pandemic. Subjects and methods: The temporal and spatial profile of the COVID-19 spread is highly dynamic and is progressively changing at a rapid pace. This article is an attempt to mitigate the pandemic threat by sharing the review outcome from an extensive literature survey on recent articles on COVID-19 and its impact. Results: Statistical analysis presented by the World Health Organization and other health organizations explicitly indicates that optimized support and care extended to infected persons is the key to therapy, and the clinical effectiveness of alternative techniques is still under study. Though there have been announcements on the discovery of drugs for the virus, the authenticity of these reports are yet to be verified. Conclusion: Based on the review, it can be inferred that it is important to boost one's immune system and to stay healthy by developing healthy habits of food intake, sleep, exercise, personal hygiene and so on. Practicing social distancing with a self-motivated attitude will help to control the virus to a large extent.

Discipline-specific geriatric competencies and the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) competencies were aligned to the 4Ms framework. The goal of the resulting program, Creating Interprofessional Readiness for Complex and Aging Adults (CIRCAA), was to advance an age-friendly practice using evidence-based strategies to support wellness and improve health outcomes while also addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH). An interprofessional team employed a multidimensional approach to create age-friendly, person-centered practitioners. In this mixed methods study, questionnaires were disseminated and focus groups were conducted with two cohorts of CIRCAA scholars to determine their ability to incorporate learned evidence-based strategies into their own practice environments. Themes and patterns were identified among transcribed interview recordings. Multiple coders were used to identify themes and patterns and inter-coder reliability was assessed. The findings indicate that participants successfully incorporated age-friendly principles and best practices into their own work environments and escaped the silos of their disciplines through the implementation of their capstone projects. Quantitative data supported qualitative themes and revealed gains in knowledge of critical components of age-friendly healthcare and perceptions of interprofessional collaborative care. These results are discussed within a new conceptual framework for studying the multidimensional complexity of what it means to be age-friendly. Our findings suggest that programs such as CIRCAA have the potential to improve older adults health by addressing SDOH, advancing age-friendly and patient-centered care, and promoting an interprofessional model of evidence-based practice.","output":"Creating Interprofessional Readiness to Advance Age-Friendly U.S. Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"So far, effective antivirals have not been widely available for treating COVID-19.

Women with moderate to severe hot flushes (&#8805;7/d or &#8805;50/wk) were randomized (VMS substudy) to daily E2/P4a(mg/mg) of 1/100, 0.5/100, 0.5/50, 0.25/50, or placebo. Proportions of women with &#8805;50% or &#8805;75% reductions in moderate to severe VMS (responders), and those with no severe VMS as well as the weekly number of days without moderate to severe VMS with TX-001HR versus placebo were determined. Mixed model repeated measures was used to analyze data and Fisher exact test was employed to compare E2/P4 versus placebo. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-six women were eligible for the VMS efficacy analysis (E2/P4a1/100 [na=a141], 0.5/100 [na=a149], 0.5/50 [na=a147], 0.25/50 [na=a154], or placebo [na=a135]). Significantly more women treated with all E2/P4 doses versus placebo were &#8805;50% responders and &#8805;75% responders at weeks 4 and 12 (Pa<a0.05) and also had significantly more days per week without moderate to severe VMS at week 12 (1.9-3.0 d for E2/P4 versus 1.3 d for placebo; Pa<a0.05).

This study evaluated the contribution of specific infectious disease agents in the development of BRD in cattle from Brazil and determined if a virus within the malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) group and Mycoplasma bovis, acting individually or in conjunction, can be associated with the development of BRD. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pulmonary sections were used in immunohistochemical assays to determine the intralesional presence of six antigens associated with BRD: bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), MCFV, and M. bovis. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 82.7% (120/145) of all cattle evaluated. Interstitial pneumonia (60%, 72/120) and suppurative bronchopneumonia (25.8%, 31/120) were the most frequent patterns of pneumonia identified. Intralesional antigens of MCFV (53.3%, 64/120) were the most frequently associated with BRD, followed by M. bovis (47.5%, 57/120), BVDV (42.5%, 51/120), BoHV-1 (28.3%, 34/120), BRSV (24.2%, 29/120), and BPIV-3 (8.3%, 10/120). Additionally, antigens of BVDV, MCFV, and M. bovis were the most frequently identified agents associated with singular and concomitant infections. The MCFV identified during this study is more likely to be ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), since OvHV-2 is the only MCFV identified within the geographical region of this study. Interstitial pneumonia with proliferative vascular lesions may be a useful histologic feature to differentiate MCFV-induced pneumonia from other viral pneumonias of cattle. These results demonstrate that MCFV and M. bovis, in single or mixed infections, can produce pneumonia in cattle and should therefore be considered as primary agents in the development of BRD.","output":"The Participation of a Malignant Catarrhal Fever Virus and Mycoplasma bovis in the Development of Single and Mixed Infections in Beef and Dairy Cattle With Bovine Respiratory Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients with COVID-19 attending the emergency department (ED), before hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with AP in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-AP) during the COVID outbreak. We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72?, 95%CI=0.54-0.94?). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61?, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%. Twenty-six clinical characteristics of COVID patients were associated with a higher risk of developing AP: abdominal pain (OR=59.4, 95%CI=23.7-149), raised blood amylase (OR=31.8; 95%CI=1.60-632) and vomiting (OR=15.8, 95%CI=6.69-37.2) being the strongest, and some inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelets, D-dimer) were more increased. Compared to non-COVID-AP, COVID-AP patients differed in 23 variables; the strongest ones related to COVID symptoms, but less abdominal pain was reported, pancreatic enzymes raise was lower, and severity (estimated by BISAP and SOFA score at ED arrival) was higher. The in-hospital mortality (adjusted for age and sex) of COVID-AP did not differ from COVID-non-AP (OR=1.12, 95%CI=0.45-245) but was higher than non-COVID-AP (OR=2.46, 95%CI=1.35-4.48). CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis as presenting form of COVID-19 in the ED is unusual (<1? cases). Some clinically distinctive characteristics are present compared to the remaining COVID patients and can help to identify this unusual manifestation. In-hospital mortality of COVID-AP does not differ from COVID-non-AP but is higher than non-COVID-AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.","output":"A case-control emergency department-based analysis of acute pancreatitis in Covid-19: Results of the UMC-19-S6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a newly discovered virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in different age groups in many countries.

Using a maximum likelihood-based codon substitution model of sequence evolution, here we report that sequences of extracellular domain of 8 amino acid sites in lineage 1a, and 3 amino acid sites each in lineage 1b, 2a, and 2b have a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) than the synonymous substitutions (d(S)) with a posterior probability above 0.95, thus suggesting the evidence of adaptive evolution driven by Darwinian selection. Although it is unclear whether these amino acid adaptations are driven by differential immune pressure or some other factors, identification of these positively selected amino acid sites would help in better screening using epitope mapping technology to identify and localize the sites that can be recognized by the immune system. We also observed surprisingly higher nucleotide substitution rates per site, per year for each lineage of hMPV than the rates that were previously reported for the human respiratory syncytial virus, suggesting rapid evolutionary dynamics of hMPV.","output":"Positive natural selection in the evolution of human metapneumovirus attachment glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and rapidly spread throughout China, however, confirmed cases are still increasing worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. STUDY DESIGN: Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). RESULTS: Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years ( 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.","output":"Epidemiological and initial clinical characteristics of patients with family aggregation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency department observation units (EDOUs) have been shown to decrease length of stay and improve cost effectiveness. Yet, compared with noncancer patients, patients with cancer are placed in EDOUs less often. In this study, we aimed to describe patients who were placed in a cancer center's EDOU to discern their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study that included all patients age 18 years and older who presented to our emergency department (ED) and were placed in the EDOU between March 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. The patients' electronic medical records were queried for demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis at the time of placement in the EDOU, length of stay, disposition from the EDOU, ED return within 72 hours after discharge from the EDOU, and mortality outcomes at 14 and 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 2,461 visits were eligible for analysis. Cancer-related pain was the main reason for observation in more than one quarter of the visits. The median length of stay in the EDOU was approximately 23 hours, and 69.6% of the patients were discharged. The ED return rate for unscheduled visits at 72 hours was 1.9%. The 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher for patients who were admitted than for those who were discharged (14 days: 1.7% v 0.3%, P < .001; 30 days: 5.9% v 1.8%, P < .001).

Then came the human genome project (HGP), a thirteen-year international effort, 1990-2003, with the primary goal of discovering the complete set of human genes, sequencing nucleotides, and making the information accessible worldwide for further biological studies. We have come a long way since that time in terms of sequencing the genes of the human genome. Now the researchers can sequence the DNA and analyze gene-expressed proteins in individual cells, allowing them to dissect the complexities of genetic diseases with exceptional details. Currently, technologies are available for single-cell or multi-omics platforms to analyze genotype and phenotype. The completion of this one-of-a-kind project created public expectations for immediate, better health care delivery and possible cures for so called incurable diseases. The HGP was the single most influential investment made in modern basic science research. A monumental breakthrough in medicine has given us the ability to sequence the DNA in cancer cells to identify possible errors in mutations. The impact of the HGPs success was so significant that President Barack Obama initiated a very ambitious new precision medicine research initiative and announced the launch of this project during his State of the Union Address in 2015. The benefits of precision and personalized medicine include predicting susceptibility to diseases, improving disease diagnostics, preempting disease progression, customizing disease prevention strategies, and developing personalized drugs and therapies. As examples of emerging therapies, we have discussed the role of biomolecules and biologics in precision medicine applications like The All of Us, personalized medicine approaches for monogenic diseases like hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and other rare genetic disorders, and CRISPR gene-editing technologies. Biomolecules play an essential role in all life processes, a variety of signaling processes, which are vital for normal functioning of physiological responses, in the early diagnosis of risk factors for various diseases, in the development of diseases and their progress. Furthermore, biomolecules, RNAs, DNAs, molecular and cellular engineering, genetic engineering of biologics, cells, tissues, and organs, play an important role in emerging therapeutic applications. The majority of the therapies discussed in this review are regulated as biologics under the Public Health Services Act of the USA. There is great interest in developing targeted therapy or precision medicine therapy for monogenic diseases, organ transplant applications, and tumor management, designed to interfere with targeted molecules for cancer-causing genes to slow the spread of cancer cells. Because molecular engineering, the development of biologics, gene-editing applications, and biomanufacturing are key components of emerging therapies, a keynote series was organized at INTERPHEX in November of 2021. INTEPHEX is the premier event that offers the latest intelligence, cutting-edge technologies, and state-of-the-art innovation for product development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology platforms.

Difatty acylation led to a significant reduction in the antiviral activity of RDV (as shown in conjugates 5a and 5b) against SARS-CoV-2 when compared with monofatty acylation (3a-e and 4a-e). About 77.9% of 4c remained intact after 4 h incubation with human plasma while only 47% of parent RDV was observed at the 2 h time point. The results clearly indicate the effectiveness of fatty acylation to improve the half-life of RDV. The antiviral activities of a number of monofatty acyl conjugates of RDV, such as 3b, 3e, and 4b, were comparable with RDV against the Ebola trVLP system. Meanwhile, the corresponding physical mixtures of RDV and fatty acids 6a and 6b showed 1.6 to 2.2 times less antiviral activity than the corresponding conjugates, 4a and 4c, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells. A significant reduction in viral RNA synthesis was observed for selected compounds 3a and 4b consistent with the IC50 results. These studies indicate the potential of these compounds as long-acting antiviral agents or prodrugs of RDV.","output":"Synthesis and antiviral activity of fatty acyl conjugates of remdesivir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Ebola virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the impact of immigration on adolescent developmental outcomes has received extensive scholarly attention, the impact of internal migration, particularly in the Chinese context, on adolescents psychosocial development has not been scientifically investigated.

Decreases in rSO2 >20 % from baseline have been associated with cerebral ischemia and increased perioperative morbidity. During transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), hemodynamic manipulation with ventricular pacing up to 180 beats per minute is necessary for valve deployment. The magnitude and duration of rSO2 change during this manipulation is unclear. In this small case series, changes in rSO2 in patients undergoing TAVR are investigated. Ten ASA IV patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia at a university hospital were prospectively observed. Cerebral oximetry values were analyzed at four points: pre-procedure (baseline), after tracheal intubation, during valve deployment, and at procedure end. Baseline rSO2 values were 54.5  6.9 %. After induction of general anesthesia, rSO2 increased to a mean of 66.0  6.7 %. During valve deployment, the mean rSO2 decreased <20 % below baseline to 48.5  13.4 %. In two patients, rSO2 decreased >20 % of baseline. Cerebral oxygenation returned to post-induction values in all patients 13  10 min after valve deployment. At procedure end, the mean rSO2 was 67.6  8.1 %. As expected, rapid ventricular pacing resulting in the desired decrease in cardiac output during valve deployment was associated with a significant decrease in rSO2 compared to post-induction values. However, despite increased post-induction values in all patients, whether related to increased inspired oxygen fraction or reduced cerebral oxygen consumption under anesthesia, two patients experienced a significant decrease in rSO2 compared to baseline. Recovery to baseline was not immediate, and took up to 20 min in three patients. Furthermore, baseline rSO2 in this population was at the lower limit of the published normal range. Significant cerebral desaturation during valve deployment may potentially be limited by maximizing rSO2 after anesthetic induction. Future studies should attempt to correlate recovery in rSO2 with recovery of hemodynamics and cardiac function, provide detailed neurological assessments pre and post procedure, determine the most effective method of maximizing rSO2 prior to hemodynamic manipulation, and provide the most rapid method of recovery of rSO2 following valve deployment.","output":"Changes in cerebral oxygen saturation during transcatheter aortic valve replacement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to GLOBOCAN, about 1.41 million new prostate cancer (PCa) cases were registered in the year 2020 globally. The corresponding socio-economic burden is enormous. Anti-cancer mRNA-based therapy is a promising approach, the principle of which is currently applied for anti-COVID-19 vaccination, undergoing a detailed investigation in populations considering its short- and long-term effectiveness and potential side effects. Pragmatically considered, it will take years or even decades to make mRNA therapy working for any type of cancers, and if possible, for individual malignancy sub-types which are many specifically for the PCa. Actually, the costs of treating PCa are increasing more rapidly than those of any other cancer. The trend has to be reversed now, not in a couple of years. In general, two main components are making currently applied reactive (management of clinically manifested disease) PCa treatment particularly expensive. On one hand, it is rapidly increasing incidence of the disease and metastatic PCa as its subtype. To this end, rapidly increasing PCa incidence rates in young and middle-aged male sub-populations should be taken into account as a long-term contributor to the metastatic disease potentially developed later on in life. On the other hand, patient stratification to differentiate between non-metastatic PCa (no need for an extensive and costly treatment) and particularly aggressive cancer subtypes requiring personalised treatment algorithms is challenging. Considering current statistics, it becomes obvious that reactive medicine got at its limit in PCa management. Multi-professional expertise is unavoidable to create and implement anti-PCa programmes in the population. In our strategic paper, we exemplify challenging PCa management by providing detailed expert recommendations for primary (health risk assessment), secondary (prediction and prevention of metastatic disease in PCa) and tertiary (making palliative care to the management of chronic disease) care in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine.","output":"Prostate cancer treatment costs increase more rapidly than for any other cancerhow to reverse the trend?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to assess the quality of the information about COVID-19 that Spanish dentists felt they were provided;their opinion about the actions by Health Institutions;their perception of the risk infection at work;and the security measures implemented to prevent contagion Material and Methods: A specific questionnaire was developed and made available online from March 18th to 20th 2020 Dentists working in Spain were invited to answer Questions were divided in 4 sections: demographic data and professional activity;specific information on COVID-19 and opinion about the decisions taken by Dental Councils and Health Authorities;risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 in dental practices;and implementation of new ways of working Chi-square tests were computed (p&lt;0 05) 873 dentists answered the survey Results: A majority of dentists considered that Health Authorities did not take right decisions during the outbreak (86 37%), and were concerned both about getting infected at work (83 16%) and being a potential carrier to their patients (72 97%) Due to COVID-19, 59 11% of the dentists incorporated new protective measures in the dental practice, 60 17% began dealing with emergencies only and 39 18% stopped working Conclusions: Most dentists were worried about infection in their workplaces, particularly women and dentists from the most affected regions by COVID-19 Almost 90% of the participants considered that this pandemic will change the way they provide dental care in the future Key words: COVID-19, pandemic, disease transmission, dentists' behavior, dental practice","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the work of Spanish dentists: An early response to the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukins (ILs)-which are important members of cytokines-consist of a vast group of molecules, including a wide range of immune mediators that contribute to the immunological responses of many cells and tissues.

The three questions prompted responses on how Brexit has impacted their personal lives, their professional lives, and their future migration decisions. Fifty-nine doctors participated in the questionnaire with 52 (88.1%) providing one or more responses to the three free-text questions. Twenty-seven doctors provided answers to all three free-text questions (51.9% of included sample). Thematic analysis was used to analyse this qualitative data.

This single-centre observational study reports data from a UK renal transplant centre with regards to seroprevalence amongst staff members. Members of staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) with Abbott International assays. Electronic records were accessed for PCR RNA and antibody results, with data anonymised by hospital number. IgA antibodies were not tested due to test kit availability during this period. 200 members of staff (25% male, 75% female, mean age 45.3  12.0 years) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 24/200 (12.0%) positive. Most interestingly, 2/30 (6.6%) co-workers had positive nose/throat RNA PCR but negative antibody tests. This study demonstrates that frontline healthcare workers have a relatively low seroprevalence rate of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. To further evaluate this, larger patient populations, multicentre studies and different antibody assays are needed to better understand whether detection of antibodies is suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the current COVID-19 pandemic amongst co-workers at a UK renal transplant centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Without rescue drugs approved, holistic approach by daily hemodialysis, noninvasive ventilation, anti\\\\inflammatory medications, fluid assessment by bedside ultrasound, and anxiolytics improved outcomes of a maintenance hemodialysis patient affected by severe COVID\\\\19.","output":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2Crelated ARDS in a maintenance hemodialysis patient: case report on tailored approach by daily hemodialysis, noninvasive ventilation, tocilizumab, anxiolytics, and point\\\\of\\\\care ultrasound"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a post-pandemic world, museums open and close continuously;meanwhile, the lack of visitors results in deaccession or layoffs (at least this is the case with many private institutions).

To determine the relative risk of infection from different types of foods, we assessed survival of SARS-CoV-2 on refrigerated ready-to-eat deli items, fresh produce, and meats (including seafood). Deli items and meats with high protein, fat, and moisture maintained infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 for up to 21 days. However, processed meat, such as salami, and some fresh produce exhibited antiviral effects. SARS-CoV-2 also remained infectious in ground beef cooked rare or medium, but not well-done. Although infectious SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated on the foods over time, viral RNA was not degraded in similar trends, regardless of food type; thus, PCR-based assays for detection of pathogens on foods only indicate the presence of viral RNA, but do not correlate with presence or quantity of infectious virus. The survival and high recovery of SARS-CoV-2 on certain foods support the possibility that food contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be a source of infection, highlighting the importance of proper food handling and cooking to inactivate any contaminating virus prior to consumption.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Remains Infectious on Refrigerated Deli Food, Meats, and Fresh Produce for up to 21 Days"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the humanity at a global level to a large extent by the burden of the disease with significant mortality and to a certain extent as a byproduct of the necessary efforts to contain the same.

This paper presents initial intensive-care unit (ICU) experiences with COVID-19 patients at Roskilde Hospital, which was the primary recipient of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care in the Zealand Region, Denmark. METHODS: An evaluation was conducted of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure from 11 March 2020 to 01 April 2020. The number of ICU beds was increased from eight to 22 beds during this period. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (four women) were evaluated. The median age was 69.5 years (range: 56-84 years). All the patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and all needed mechanical ventilation by orotracheal intubation. By 16 April, six patients were still admitted to the ICU, four patients had been discharged from the ICU and seven had died. At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14  9 days (mean  standard deviation). One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days. The evaluation revealed four key themes. COVID-19 patients 1) had greatly increased C-reactive protein levels, 2) needed a significant inspiratory O2fraction, 3) were highly positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependent on ventilatory support and 4) suffered highly fluctuating respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for a significantly longer period of time than non-COVID-19 patients.

We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from delayed diagnosis, staging, and treatment of bladder cancer. We showed that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a deferred oncological diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. More attention is required to avoid adverse outcomes, with increased rates of advanced and aggressive tumors in patients with primary bladder cancer. Moreover, timely treatment is compulsory in those patients. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)-induced effects on deferred diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer (BC) patients are currently not clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic by considering its effects on tumor stage and grade, and to create feasible clinical triage decisions. A retrospective single-center analysis of all patients who underwent diagnostic and surgical procedures due to BC, during January 2019 and December 2020, was performed. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns, significantly fewer (diagnostic and therapeutic) endoscopic procedures were performed in the first 6 months of 2020 compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). In patients with a primary diagnosis of BC, a significant increase of high-grade tumors (p < 0.001), as well as advanced tumor stages (p = 0.014), were noticed during 2020 in comparison to 2019. On the contrary, patients with recurrent BC undergoing risk-adapted surveillance, depending on previous tumor histology, showed no adverse outcomes regarding tumor stage and grade when comparing the pre COVID-19 era with 2020. Thus, more awareness in clinical urologic practice is mandatory to avoid adverse consequences, with increased rates of advanced and aggressive tumors in patients with primary BC. In recurrent BC, an individual risk stratification in order to avoid worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be justified.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic Gap and Its Influence on Oncologic Outcomes of Bladder Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has severely challenged the human population. NK and T cells are involved in the progression of COVID-19 infection through the ability of NK cells to modulate T-cell responses, and by the stimulation of cytokine release. No detailed investigation of the NK cell landscape in clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection has yet been reported. A total of 35 COVID-19 hospitalised patients were stratified for clinical severity and 17 healthy subjects were enrolled. NK cell subsets and T cell subsets were analysed with flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were detected with a bead-based multiplex assay. Fewer CD56(dim)CD16(bright)NKG2A(+)NK cells and a parallel increase in the CD56(+)CD69(+)NK, CD56(+)PD-1(+)NK, CD56(+)NKp44(+)NK subset were reported in COVID-19 than HC. A significantly higher adaptive/memory-like NK cell frequency in patients with severe disease than in those with mild and moderate phenotypes were reported. Moreover, adaptive/memory-like NK cell frequencies were significantly higher in patients who died than in survivors. Severe COVID-19 patients showed higher serum concentrations of IL-6 than mild and control groups. Direct correlation emerged for IL-6 and adaptive/memory-like NK. All these findings provide new insights into the immune response of patients with COVID-19. In particular, they demonstrate activation of NK through overexpression of CD69 and CD25 and show that PD-1 inhibitory signalling maintains an exhausted phenotype in NK cells.

The aim of this meta-analysis study is to explore the associations between arginine with its related catabolic products and MDD, and to discuss the possible role of arginine catabolism in the pathoetiology of MDD. METHODS: This study will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The English language literature published in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science will be systematically searched. Forest plots will be used to estimate the associations between arginine and its related catabolic products with MDD. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression will also be performed to investigate the source of the potential heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to strengthen the results and to investigate whether any single study would have a significant effect on the results of meta-analysis. Publication bias will be tested for using the funnel plot with Begg test and Egger test. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be applied to assess the risk of bias of observational studies.

It requires periodic mass screening in risk population groups such as prisoners and refugees. Unfortunately, in these risk population groups periodic mass screening can be challenging due to lengthy turnaround time (TAT), cost and implementation constraints. The aim of this study was to evaluate a diagnostic algorithm that can reduce the TAT and cost for TB and Rifampicin resistance (RR) detection. The algorithm involves testing with TB-LAMP followed by Xpert MTB/RIF for positive TB-LAMP cases to diagnose TB during mass campaigns in prisons and refugee camps. METHODS: The National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTCP) organized routine TB mass-screening campaigns in 34 prisons and 3 villages with refugees camps in Cameroon in 2019. TB LAMP was used for initial TB diagnosis and all TB-LAMP positive cases tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay to determine RR. TAT and cost benefits analysis of the combined use of TB-LAMP and Xpert MTB/RIF assays was determined and compared to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay when used only. RESULTS: A total of 4075 sputum samples were collected from TB presumptive, 3672 cases in 34 prisons and 403 samples in 3 villages. Of the 4,075 samples screened with TB-LAMP, 135 were TB positive (3.31%) and run on the Xpert MTB/RIF. Of the 135 positives cases, Xpert MTB/RIF revealed 3 were RR (2.22%). The use of TB-LAMP followed by testing with Xpert MTB/RIF for TB and RR detection reduced the TAT by 73.23% in prisons and 74.92% in villages. In addition to a reduced TAT, the two molecular tests used in synergy is cost benefit from year 2 onwards. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the advantages of a diagnostic algorithm based on an initial testing with TB-LAMP followed by testing with Xpert MTB/RIF for TB diagnosis. This approach improved early and rapid TB detection with an added advantage of providing RR status. The proposed algorithm is effective and less costly from the second year of implementation and should be used by TB control programs.","output":"A cost-benefit algorithm for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance detection during mass screening campaigns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination was examined.

For the latter, surrogate assays (sVNT) and a Vero-cell based neutralization test (cVNT) were used. Maturity of IgG was determined by measuring the avidity in an immunoblot (IB). Past VOC infection resulted in a broad reactivity of anti-S IgG (100%), anti-RBD IgG (100%), and anti-N IgG (91%), while latter were absent in 99% of vaccinees. Starting approximately two weeks after the first vaccine dose, anti-S IgG (75C100%) and particularly anti-RBD IgG (98C100%) were detectable. After the second dose, their titers increased and were higher than in the convalescents. The sVNT showed evidence of VNA in 91% of convalescents and in 80C100%/100% after first/second vaccine dose, respectively. After the second dose, an increase in VNA titer and IgGs of high avidity were demonstrated by cVNT and IB, respectively.

However, direct evidence of autoimmunity, infections, or a proinflammatory state is often lacking, and there is no unifying pathogenic pathway. This could be due to underlying genetic heterogeneity, which could lead to the development of PANS through different cellular and molecular pathways. Unfortunately, little is known about the genetic basis of PANS. Consequently, we carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) on a U.S. cohort of 386 cases who met diagnostic criteria for PANS, including 133 family triads, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on ten cases from the European Union, who were selected for WGS because of severe PANS symptoms. We focused on identifying potentially deleterious genetic variants that were either de novo or ultra-rare with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001. Candidate mutations were found in 11 genes: PPM1D, SGCE, PLCG2, NLRC4, CACNA1B, SHANK3, CHK2, GRIN2A, RAG1, GABRG2, and SYNGAP1 in a total of 20 cases, which included two sets of siblings, and two or more unrelated subjects with ultra-rare variants in SGCE, NLRC4, RAG1, and SHANK3. The PANS candidate genes we identified separate into two broad functional categories. One group regulates peripheral innate and adaptive immune responses (e.g., PPM1D, CHK2, NLRC4, RAG1, PLCG2), some of which also influence microglia function. Another is expressed primarily at neuronal synapses or directly modulates synaptic function (SHANK3, SYNGAP1, GRIN2A, GABRG2, CACNA1B, SGCE). These neuronal PANS candidate genes are often mutated in autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorders, and myoclonus-dystonia. In fact, eight out of 20 cases in this study developed PANS superimposed on a preexisting neurodevelopmental disorder. There is, however, clinical overlap between these two groups and some crossover expression (e.g., some neuronal genes are expressed in immune cells and vice versa) that diminishes the neuronal/immune dichotomy. Genes in both categories are also highly expressed in the enteric nervous system, and in the choroid plexus and brain vasculature, suggesting they might contribute to a breach in the blood-CSF barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) that would permit the entry of autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and autoantibodies into the brain. Thus, PANS is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can occur as a stand-alone neuropsychiatric condition or co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders, with candidate genes functioning at several levels of the neuroinflammatory axis.","output":"Identification of ultra-rare genetic variants in Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) by exome and whole genome sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both conceptual modeling and machine learning have long been recognized as important areas of research. With the increasing emphasis on digitizing and processing large amounts of data for business and other applications, it would be helpful to consider how these areas of research can complement each other. To understand how they can be paired, we provide an overview of machine learning foundations and development cycle. We then examine how conceptual modeling can be applied to machine learning and propose a framework for incorporating conceptual modeling into data science projects. The framework is illustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse pairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule mining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and machine learning in this this way should help lay the foundations for future research.","output":"Pairing Conceptual Modeling with Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existing knowledge is insufficient to explain some infection events of SARS-CoV-2, and new ideas about the transmission modes may be needed. The present study proposes that the RNAs of this virus might be infectious and that the transmission of these RNAs might be one route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. I speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are infectious based on the following rationale and offer a putative mechanism: RNA is the most important biomolecule of the novel coronavirus for expression and replication, free RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to remain suspended in the air and retain their biological activity, and some exogenous RNAs can enter the host cell after contact. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. It is worthwhile to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 components (e.g., virus particles, positive RNA strands, negative RNA strands, and virus proteins) with symptoms to study the mechanism of asymptomatic infection. If additional detection results show that the proportion of RNA in the environment is higher than the proportion of RNA in the novel coronavirus particles, this would suggest the potential presence of free RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Research on the temporal and spatial distribution of infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA strands is necessary. The nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 should target not only positive RNA strands but also negative RNA strands. For medical purposes, studying environmental RNAs (eRNAs) is important. I believe that further investigation of the infection capabilities of viral RNAs will yield useful information.","output":"Can the novel coronavirus be transmitted via RNAs without protein capsids?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the course of Covid\\\\19, the disease caused by the new Coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, thrombotic phenomena and/or diffuse vascular damage are frequent, and viral elements have been observed within endothelial cells. OBJECTIVES: CD146+ circulating endothelial cells (CD146+ CECs) and their progenitors (CEPs) are increased in cardiovascular, thrombotic, infectious and cancer diseases. The present study was designed to investigate their kinetics in Covid\\\\19 patients. METHOD: We used a validated flow cytometry procedure to enumerate viable and apoptotic CD146+ CECs and CEPs in Covid\\\\19 patients during the course of the disease and in patients who recovered. RESULT: Viable CEPs/mL were significantly increased in Covid\\\\19 patients compared to healthy controls. This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls. Regarding mature CD146+ CECs, in Covid\\\\19 patients their absolute number was similar to those observed in healthy controls, but the viable/apoptotic CD146+ CEC ratio was significantly different. Both mild and severe Covid\\\\19 patients had significantly less apoptotic CD146+ CECs compared to healthy controls.

During the COVID-19 pandemic teaching has been offered in a virtual format and clinical placements have been restricted. Our aim was to survey medical educators regarding these changes, seeking their views on resources and skills required for virtual teaching, student engagement, and adaptations to placements. Method 73 medical educators who had undertaken teaching or clinical supervision were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during December 2020. The survey consisted of Likert scale and open space questions surrounding changes necessitated by the pandemic. Following survey closure quantitative data were analysed using Google Forms and Excel. Qualitative data from the survey were reviewed by all team members to identify relevant themes. Result Overall response rate was 40% (29), with participants from 5 NHS trusts. 72% (21) of educators felt they had adequate equipment and resources to facilitate virtual teaching. 55% (16) felt they had adequate training and skills to use virtual teaching platforms effectively. However only 17% (5) felt that students were able to engage in virtual teaching to the same extent as face to face sessions, and just 35% (10) of educators reported enjoying virtual teaching. 76% (22) agreed that information from the University about adjustments to clinical placements was adequate. 66% (19) felt that there had been adequate support to ensure the safety of students, supervisors and patients. However only 20% (6) felt that students had adequate patient contact and 69% (20) did not feel that students had been able meet their clinical competencies. Conclusion Our results suggest that the majority of educators have not enjoyed teaching virtually, and feel that students were less engaged. However educators were able to identify some benefits, such as inviting speakers from outside the local area, improved access to manager's hearings and tribunals and the use of simulated patients. There were also innovative suggestions, such as interactive quizzes and feedback polls within sessions. Most educators felt students had not received adequate patient contact during the pandemic and suggestions for improvement were less readily identified, they included changes to work place based assessments and timetabling. We hope using these results to work with the University to develop resources to support educators using virtual teaching methods, and to consider adjustments to clinical placement while the pandemic persists.","output":"Views of medical educators on virtual teaching methods and curriculum changes within an undergraduate psychiatry rotation during the COVID-19 pandemic C a quality improvement project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To validate the Roth score as a triage tool for detecting hypoxaemia. BACKGROUNDS: The virtual assessment of patients has become increasingly important during the corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, but has limitations as to the evaluation of deteriorating respiratory function. This study presents data on the validity of the Roth score as a triage tool for detecting hypoxaemia remotely in potential COVID-19 patients in general practice. METHODS: This cross-sectional validation study was conducted in Dutch general practice. Patients aged 18 with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were asked to rapidly count from 1 to 30 in a single breath. The Roth score involves the highest number counted during exhalation (counting number) and the time taken to reach the maximal count (counting time). Outcome measures were (1) the correlation between both Roth score measurements and simultaneous pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) on room air and (2) discrimination (c-statistic), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the Roth score for detecting hypoxaemia (SpO(2) < 95%). FINDINGS: A total of 33 physicians enrolled 105 patients (52.4% female, mean age of 52.6  20.4 years). A positive correlation was found between counting number and SpO(2) (r (s) = 0.44, P < 0.001), whereas only a weak correlation was found between counting time and SpO(2) (r (s) = 0.15, P = 0.14). Discrimination for hypoxaemia was higher for counting number [c-statistic 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85C0.96)] than for counting time [c-statistic 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62C0.93)]. Optimal diagnostic performance was found at a counting number of 20, with a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% CI: 68.1C99.8) and a specificity of 77.8% (95% CI: 67.8C85.9). A counting time of 7 s showed the best sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI: 57.2C98.2) and specificity of 81.1% (95% CI: 71.5C88.6). CONCLUSIONS: A Roth score, with an optimal counting number cut-off value of 20, maybe of added value for signalling hypoxaemia in general practice. Further external validation is warranted before recommending integration in telephone triage.","output":"The Roth score as a triage tool for detecting hypoxaemia in general practice: a diagnostic validation study in patients with possible COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breakthroughs in unsupervised domain adaptation (uDA) can help in adapting models from a label-rich source domain to unlabeled target domains. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of research on how uDA algorithms, particularly those based on adversarial learning, can work in distributed settings. In real-world applications, target domains are often distributed across thousands of devices, and existing adversarial uDA algorithms -- which are centralized in nature -- cannot be applied in these settings. To solve this important problem, we introduce FRuDA: an end-to-end framework for distributed adversarial uDA. Through a careful analysis of the uDA literature, we identify the design goals for a distributed uDA system and propose two novel algorithms to increase adaptation accuracy and training efficiency of adversarial uDA in distributed settings.

Conservation of the species has become increasingly important and a focus on better human management has become prevalent. One area of management that impacts southern white rhinoceroses is nutritional health monitoring, which is often conducted through blood analysis. Blood analysis conducted during field research can be difficult due to temperature, distance, and limited technological resources, so new methods of fast, and relatively stable blood collection are being pursued. One method that has been used in humans for many years is beginning to make its way into wildlife studies: the use of dried blood spot (DBS) cards. These cards are used as a tool to store single drops of whole blood on specialized filter paper and, once dried, can be used for nutritional biomarker analysis. An area of interest for southern white rhinoceroses and nutrition is monitoring fatty acid percentages for cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive health. The time and temperature limitations for storing blood fractions or liquid whole blood when analyzing fatty acids have been investigated, but few studies have performed storage studies on DBS cards colder than ?20 C or in non-human species. METHODS: In order to better understand the limitations of DBS cards and the impact of temperature on fatty acid DBS samples in long-term storage, triplicate samples from seven adult southern white rhinoceroses at the North Carolina Zoo were collected and subjected to three storage treatments (immediate, room temperature (23 C), or frozen (?80 C) for 1 year). RESULTS: Stearidonic (18:4w3) ( 0.3%), arachdic (20:0) ( 0.1%), eicosatetraenoic (20:4w3) ( 0.2%), and erucic acid (22:1w9) ( 0.1%) were in higher concentration in frozen than initial. Fatty acids in higher concentrations in the initial samples than frozen were myristic (14:0) ( 0.2%), mead (20:3w9) ( 0.1%), docosatetraenoic (22:4w6) ( 0.2%), nervonic (24:1) ( 0.1%), and total highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) ( 0.7%). Stearic (18:0) ( 2.2%), stearidonic (18:4w3) ( 0.3%), arachdic (20:0) ( 0.2%), paullinic (20:1w7) ( 0.4%), eicosatetraenoic (20:4w3) ( 0.1%), eicosapentaenoic (20:5w3) ( 0.1%), docosatetraenoic (22:4w6) ( 0.2%), nervonic acid (24:1) ( 0.2%), monoenes ( 1.9%), and total saturates ( 3.6%) had higher concentrations in room temperature than initial. Linoleic (18:2w6) ( 4.9%), mead acid (20:3w9) ( 0.1%), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (5.3%), and total omega-6 fatty acids ( 4.8%) had higher concentrations in initial compared to room temperature. Arachidonic (20:4w6) ( 0.4%) and omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid (22:5w3) ( 0.1%), had higher concentrations in frozen than in room temperature. DISCUSSION: The frozen samples had the fewest statistical differences compared to room temperature samples and essential omega-3 and -6 fatty acids were stable with freezing up to 1 year. While more research is still warranted, current results suggest that DBS samples are best utilized when immediate analysis or ?80 C storage is available.","output":"Assessment of the effects of storage temperature on fatty acid analysis using dried blood spot cards from managed southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum): implications for field collection and nutritional care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research note investigates the stock market reactions of international hospitality firms to COVID-19?s pandemic announcement by the World Health Organization In line with the behavioral finance literature, the findings indicate that, in the short term, investors overestimated the risks underlying asset-heavy firms because of information uncertainty Firms pursuing an asset-light (AL) strategy are associated to significantly less negative cumulative abnormal returns in the 4 days following the announcement, especially firms following an AL strategy that reduces significantly the operating leverage However, this difference vanishes after 5 trading days, meaning that investors revised their expectations This research note suggests that the cost structure of AL firms matters in reducing information uncertainty and sheds light on the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on the hospitality industry It also provides useful information to board members, financial analysts, and companies? top managers when evaluating whether and how to pursue an AL strategy, and the potential consequences of it","output":"Asset-light strategies and stock market reactions to COVID-19s pandemic announcement: The case of hospitality firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a person going up- or downstairs was investigated through a laboratory experiment in a water tunnel.

This essay examines the basis and limits of duty to treat in a time of crisis and explores how these experiences could leave doctors morally stressed and even compromised. We question whether a physician-patient relationship that treats patients' safety and well-being as separate from their doctors' personal and professional values, needs, and dignity is the best way to deliver care.

It has been suggested that cannabis could generate blurred vision during reading tasks. The goal of this study was to objectively assess the acute effects of smoking cannabis on the dynamics of ocular accommodation. The influence of other factors, including target distance and the direction of accommodation, as well as personal characteristics, were also analysed. METHODS Nineteen young people who were occasional cannabis users participated in the study (mean age 22.53 [3.12] years). Their usage profiles were evaluated by means of the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test-revised (CUDIT-r). The dynamics of the accommodative response were evaluated using an open-field auto refractor (Grand Seiko WAM-5500). The participants completed two different experimental sessions, one week apart, and in random order (baseline session and after smoking cannabis). During these sessions, the amplitude of the response (D), mean velocity (D/s), peak velocity (D/s), response time (s), accommodative lag (D) and accommodation variability (D) were measured. RESULTS The results indicated that cannabis use had a significant main effect on the mean accommodation/disaccommodation velocity (F1,13 = 7.21; p = 0.02;  p 2 = 0.396). Cannabis consumption also interacted significantly with other factors. Response time showed a significant two-way interaction between condition  target distance (F1,13 = 11.71; p = 0.005;  p 2 = 0.474) and condition  accommodation direction (F1,13 = 8.71; p = 0.01;  p 2 = 0.401). For mean velocity, two-way interactions were found between condition  age (F1,13 = 6.03; p = 0.03;  p 2 = 0.354), condition  CUDIT-r score (F1,13 = 6.03; p = 0.03;  p 2 = 0.356) and condition  target distance (F1,13 = 7.20; p = 0.02;  p 2 = 0.396). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that cannabis use can alter the accommodation process, although further studies should be carried out to explore the role of attention deficits.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common immune-mediated demyelinating disease, remyelination efficiency declines with increasing age and disease duration. As myelin regeneration attempts in clinical trials so far are scarce, and have been met with limited success, the need to explore new remyelinating strategies is more compelling. Recently, ageing and cellular senescence have been implicated to the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Evidence on OPC senescence brings forward the possibility of exploiting cellular senescence as a possible target for promoting the endogenous remyelinating capacity of the CNS.

METHODS: Data from electronic medical records of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March 2, 2020, to June 17, 2020, were analyzed. Patients were divided in 2 groups, those presenting with and without AMS. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were needed for mechanical ventilation, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, need for dialysis, and length of stay. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R 3.6.0.

We also examined associations between study misclassification (and by extension LOE misclassification) and the study specialty, journal specialty, and journal impact factor. Results Of 339 studies that reported a case-control design, 227 (67%) were misclassified and reflected other study designs. The study designs most often misclassified as case-control designs were retrospective cohort studies (n = 97; 43%) and cross-sectional studies (n = 88; 39%). The frequency of misclassification was associated with the subspecialty of the journal and the impact factor but not the study subspecialty. After correction of the LOE in the misclassified studies that reported an LOE (n = 193), it was found that 28 (15%) had underreported their LOE, and eight (4%) had overreported their LOE. Conclusions Studies reported in the orthopedic literature to have a case-control design frequently have another study design, and this pattern is consistent across subspecialties. Enhanced rigor in accurately defining study designs in orthopedics could be achieved through training and stricter review processes.","output":"Misclassification of Case-Control Studies in the Orthopedic Literature Is Common: A Bibliometric Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Target-based design and repositioning are mainstream strategies of drug discovery. Numerous drug design and repositioning projects have been launched to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting drug candidates have often failed due to the misprediction of their target-bound structures. The determination of water positions of such structures is particularly challenging due to the large number of possible drugs and the diversity of their hydration patterns. To answer this challenge and help correct predictions, we introduce a new protocol HydroDock, which can build hydrated drugCtarget complexes from scratch. HydroDock requires only the dry target and drug structures and produces their complexes with appropriately positioned water molecules. As a test application of the protocol, we built the structures of amantadine derivatives in complex with the influenza M2 transmembrane ion channel. The repositioning of amantadine derivatives from this influenza target to the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein was also investigated. Excellent agreement was observed between experiments and the structures determined by HydroDock. The atomic resolution complex structures showed that water plays a similar role in the binding of amphipathic amantadine derivatives to transmembrane ion channels of both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. While the hydrophobic regions of the channels capture the bulky hydrocarbon group of the ligand, the surrounding waters direct its orientation parallel with the axes of the channels via bridging interactions with the ionic ligand head. As HydroDock supplied otherwise undetermined structural details, it can be recommended to improve the reliability of future design and repositioning of antiviral drug candidates and many other ligands with an influence of water structure on their mechanism of action.","output":"Determination of Ligand Binding Modes in Hydrated Viral Ion Channels to Foster Drug Design and Repositioning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States during March and April of 2020, more than 50 million K-12 students were impacted by school closures with many forced to engage in online teaching for continuity in their 2019-2020 school year This disruption to K-12 public and private schools reverberated in programs of teacher education around the country As school-university partners, we wanted to provide opportunities for new teacher candidates to be able to engage in some form of interaction with students and veteran teachers We drew on the structures and strengths of our school-university partnership to build our plan to engage in pandemic-induced, alternative field experiences In this article, we describe how one middle level school-university partnership leaned into virtual learning spaces and provided opportunities to help teacher candidates who were beginning their teacher education program conceptualize teaching and learning in new ways Additionally, we provide classroom teachers' perspectives on hosting teacher candidates in a virtual learning format, offering insights on best practices and challenges to ponder","output":"Field Experiences in the Ether: The Pandemic-Induced Realities of Learning to Teach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Accurate segmentation of the pancreas using abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans is a prerequisite for a computer-aided diagnosis system to detect pathologies and perform quantitative assessment of pancreatic disorders. Manual outlining of the pancreas is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to subjective errors, and thus clearly not a viable solution for large datasets. Approach: We introduce a multiphase morphology-guided deep learning framework for efficient three-dimensional segmentation of the pancreas in CT images. The methodology works by localizing the pancreas using a modified visual geometry group-19 architecture, which is a 19-layer convolutional neural network model that helped reduce the region of interest for more efficient computation and removed most of the peripheral structures from consideration during the segmentation process. Subsequently, soft labels for segmentation of the pancreas in the localized region were generated using the U-net model. Finally, the model integrates the morphology prior of the pancreas to update soft labels and perform segmentation. The morphology prior is a single three-dimensional matrix, defined over the general shape and size of the pancreases from multiple CT abdominal images, that helps improve segmentation of the pancreas. Results: The system was trained and tested on the National Institutes of Health dataset (82 CT scans of the healthy pancreas). In fourfold cross-validation, the system produced an average Dice-S?rensen coefficient of 88.53% and outperformed state-of-the-art techniques. Conclusions: Localizing the pancreas assists in reducing segmentation errors and eliminating peripheral structures from consideration. Additionally, the morphology-guided model efficiently improves the overall segmentation of the pancreas.","output":"Morphology-guided deep learning framework for segmentation of pancreas in computed tomography images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the world, the public is being informed about the physical effects of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and steps to take to prevent exposure to the coronavirus and manage symptoms of COVID\\\\19 if they appear.

Even though it can cause tracheal lesions, its adverse effects on the trachea have not been sufficiently studied. The present study investigated tracheal changes in Arbor Acres broilers (Gallus gallus) induced by high concentration of ammonia using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteome analysis. In total, 3,706 proteins within false discovery rate of 1% were identified, including 119 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis revealed that proteins related to immune response and muscle contraction were significantly enriched. With respect to the immune response, up-regulated proteins (like FGA) were pro-inflammatory, while down-regulated proteins participated in antigen processing and antigen presenting (like MYO1G), immunoglobulin and cathelicidin production (like fowlicidin-2), and immunodeficiency (like PTPRC). Regarding muscle contraction, all differentially expressed proteins (like TPM1) were up-regulated. An over-expression of mucin, which is a common feature of airway disease, was also observed. Additionally, the transcriptional alterations of 6 selected proteins were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, proteomic changes suggested the onset of airway obstruction and diminished host defense in trachea after ammonia exposure. These results may serve as a valuable reference for future interventions against ammonia toxicity.

A mathematical model of the COVID-19 epidemic is modified where the recovery rate of exposed individuals is also considered. The linear stability of the equilibrium states for the modified COVID-19 model is given by finding its Jacobian and applying RouthCHurwitz criteria on characteristic polynomial. The proposed scheme provides the first-order accuracy in time and second-order accuracy in space. The stability of the proposed scheme is given using the von Neumann stability criterion for standard parabolic PDEs. The consistency for the proposed scheme is also given by expanding the involved terms in it using the Taylor series. The scheme can be used to obtain the condition of getting a positive solution. The stability region of the scheme can be enlarged by choosing suitable values of the contained parameter. Finally, a comparison of the proposed scheme is made with the existing non-standard finite difference method. The results indicate that the non-standard classical technique is incapable of preserving the unique characteristics of the models epidemiologically significant solutions, whereas the proposed approaches are capable of doing so.

This was necessary due to changes in workload and working practice guidelines that have evolved during the pandemic. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiography practice, service delivery and workforce wellbeing. METHODS: A systematic review methodology was adopted to obtain data from primary studies of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs from databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and SCOPUS: all 2020 to present). The included articles were subjected to information extraction and results-based convergent synthesis. RESULTS: The electronic database search yielded 10,420 articles after removal of duplicates. Of these, 31 articles met the final inclusion criteria with some (n = 8) fully focussed on radiotherapy workforce and service delivery. The pandemic impact on radiography practice is broadly themed around: training, communication, and information dissemination; infrastructure, technology, and clinical workflow; and workforce mental health and well-being. CONCLUSION: Globally, most radiographers received inadequate training for managing COVID-19 patients during the initial acute phase of the pandemic. Additionally, there were significant changes to clinical practice, working patterns and perceived increase in workload due to surges in COVID-19 patients and the consequent strict adherence to new infection protocols. These changes, coupled with fear emanating from the increased risk of the workforce to contracting the infection, contributed to anxiety and workplace-related stress during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Local pandemic response strategies must be appropriately developed from standard protocols in readiness for safe clinical practice and well-being management training of practitioners.","output":"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical radiography practice: A systematic literature review and recommendations for future services planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A forgotten and valuable chapter in the history of tobacco concerns its role as a botanical medicine.

There was little doubt of its medicinal efficacy at first, but with time, as the concepts and practice of medicine changed, the tide of medical opinion turned against it. Medical support for the therapeutic use of tobacco reached its nadir during the mid-nineteenth century, when it was dropped from most medical pharmacoepiae.

METHODS: Retrospective study including all patients admitted with COVID-19 in an Italian reference hospital for infectious diseases between March 1 and July 1, 2020. Predictors of viral clearance (VC) and prolonged VS from upper respiratory tract were assessed by Poisson regression and logistic regression analyses. The causal relation between duration of VS and probability of clinical outcomes was evaluated through inverse probability weighted Cox model. RESULTS: 536 subjects were included. Median duration of VS from symptoms onset was 18 days (IQR 12-26). The estimated 30-day probability of VC was 70.2% (95%CI:65-75). At multivariable analysis, patients with comorbidities (aIRR = 0.88, p = 0.004), lymphopenia at hospital admission (aIRR = 0.75, p = 0.032) and with moderate/severe respiratory disease (aIRR = 0.42, p < 0.001) had a lower chance of achieving VC. The development of moderate/severe respiratory failure (aOR = 2.65, p = 0.003), a delayed hospital admission after symptoms onset (aOR = 1.18, p < 0.001), having baseline comorbidities (aOR = 1.25, p = 0.019) and D-dimer >1000 ng/mL at admission (aOR = 1.76, p = 0.035) independently predicted prolonged VS. The achievement of VC doubled the chance of clinical recovery (aHR = 2.17, p < 0.001) and reduced the probability of death/mechanical ventilation (aHR = 0.36, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, severity of respiratory disease, comorbidities, delayed hospital admission and inflammatory markers negatively predicted the achievement of VC, which resulted to be associated to better clinical outcomes.

This short series demonstrates our experience in managing COVID-19 disease in renal transplant patients in the absence of strong evidence. We report 8 cases of kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 (median age = 48.5 years; range = 21C71 years), including 4 males and 4 females. The most frequently associated comorbidity was hypertension. The most common presenting features were fever and cough. The main radiological investigation was a portable chest X-ray.

These fungi are found in the environment such as soil, decaying vegetation, and organic matters. Sporangiospores present in the environment enter the human body through inhalation or direct skin inoculation by trauma or ingestion and result in pulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal mucormycosis, respectively, in immunocompromised hosts. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hematological malignancies, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, iron overload, and organ transplantation are at high risk of acquiring mucormycosis. The second wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] affected India severely with the highest number of cases and deaths compared to all other countries. Additionally, the country was affected by emergence of rare but life-threatening mucormycosis. Currently, many coronavirus disease 2019 patients with underlying risk factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, high-dose steroid therapy, and exposure to mechanical ventilation have developed mucormycosis. Inhalation is the most common mode of transmission that results in colonization of sporangiospores in the nose. In immunocompromised host, sporangiospores germinate, and subsequently form hyphae. These hyphae invade into tissues, and produce tissue infarction, necrosis, and thrombosis. Angioinvasion causes hematogenous dissemination to many organs, predominantly to brain, that result in rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. Clinical characteristics, radio imaging, fungal culture, histopathology, and molecular techniques are the key diagnostic methods. Surgical intervention and aggressive antifungal therapy are the main management strategies. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of mucormycosis, whereas posaconazole or isavuconazole is used for step-down therapy and salvage therapy.","output":"Storm of a rare opportunistic life threatening mucormycosis among post COVID-19 patients: A tale of two pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic, non\\\\operative management for acute appendicitis (AA) was implemented in the UK.

Data was collected from all patients (16 years) with a diagnosis of AA between November 1, 2019 to March 10, 2020 (pre-COVID period) and March 10, 2020 to July 5, 2020 (COVID period). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients in the pre-COVID period were included versus 91 in the COVID period. 43.1% (n = 50) of patients pre-COVID were classified as ASA 2 compared to 26.4% (n = 24) during the COVID period (p-value = 0.042). 72.5% (n = 66) of the patients during the COVID period scored as high risk using the Alvarado score compared to 24.1% (n = 28) in the pre-COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed a significant increase in radiological evaluation, 69.8% versus 87.5% of patients had a CT in the pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively (p-value = 0.008). 94.9% of patients were managed operatively in the pre-COVID period compared to 60.4% in the COVID period (p-value<0.001).

Methods: A multi-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study, based on five designated tertiary hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. 112 cancer patients with COVID-19, and 105 COVID-19 patients without cancer were enrolled in the study between January 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. The risk assessment of pro-inflammatory factors for disease severity and clinical adverse outcomes was identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of the 112 cancer patients with COVID-19, 40 (35.7%) patients were in critical condition and 18 (16.1%) patients died unfortunately. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that hemoglobin level and pro-inflammatory neutrophils and C-reactive protein (CRP), can be used as independent factors affecting the severity of COVID-19; Meanwhile, pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP can be used as an independent influencing factor for adverse clinical outcome of death. Moreover, the dynamic changes of neutrophils and CRP were also presented, and compared with COVID-19 patients without cancer, cancer patients with COVID-19 showed higher neutrophil counts and CRP levels. Conclusion: In cancer patients with COVID-19, the significant increase in pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP indicated a more critical illness and adverse clinical outcome, and pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP played a greater adverse role compare with COVID-19 patients without cancer, which may be the cause of critical illness and adverse clinical outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19.","output":"Prognostic Value of Pro-Inflammatory Neutrophils and C-Reactive Protein in Cancer Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multi-Center, Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on health, economies, and other societal pillars.

We then verified BUB1B expression in HCC tissues, nontumor tissues, and HCC cell lines through western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. To explore the specific function of BUB1B in HCC in vivo and in vitro, we performed the flow cytometry, Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, colony formation, Transwell, wound-healing, subcutaneous tumor growth, and metastasis assays. Additionally, we identified the BUB1B-regulated pathways involved in HCC by using gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS Our data displayed that higher BUB1B expression was detected in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. The overexpression of BUB1B was positively correlated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analyses showed that lower recurrence-free and overall survival rates were correlated with the overexpression of BUB1B in patients with HCC. Moreover, the malignancy of HCC was facilitated by BUB1B both in vivo and in vitro. Lastly, the results were confirmed by western blots, which showed that BUB1B upregulated mTORC1 signaling pathway in HCC. Meanwhile, the oncogenic effect of BUB1B will be impaired when the mTORC1 signaling pathway was inhibited by rapamycin. CONCLUSION We highlighted that BUB1B played an oncogenic role in HCC and was identified as a possible clinical prognostic factor and a potential novel therapeutic target for HCC.","output":"BUB1B promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 pneumonia varies in clinical expression from asymptomatic to severe ARDS. In early COVID-19, some patients have subtle abnormalities and their clinical trajectory is often unclear. We used an alveolar gas meter (AGM), which is designed to measure gas exchange parameters non-invasively while obviating the need for arterial blood gas measurement. The AGM has previously been compared to arterial blood gas analysis with the suggestion that the oxygen deficit by the AGM provides a useful surrogate to the alveolar to arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2) and it is sensitive to minor changes in pulmonary gas exchange. We sought to test the hypothesis that the AGM could be a useful instrument to identify COVID-19 patients at risk of deterioration before obvious respiratory failure had ensued. Methods: We identified 13 patients in the emergency department or non-ICU medical ward who were COVID-19 positive or strongly suspected to be COVID-19 positive. We enrolled patients with informed consent who did not require high dose oxygen. In patients with low dose oxygen, we removed supplemental oxygen with IRB consent to study room air gas exchange. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and an unpaired, two-tailed student's t-test with equal variance was performed to assess for statistical significance between means. Results: Among the 13 patients enrolled, 12 were COVID positive, 5 were discharged home, and 8 were admitted. The AGM readings revealed an oxygen deficit of 55.4  19.9 (mean  SD) in the hospitalized patients vs. 31.6  14.0 in those sent home (P=0.041). Among the 13 patients, 6 required supplemental oxygen whereas 7 did not. The AGM readings revealed an oxygen deficit of 65.0  9.12 in those requiring supplemental oxygen vs. 30.1  12.7 in those who remained on room air (P=0.00016). There was no statistically significant difference in the end-tidal CO2 between those who were admitted and discharged home or between those who required supplemental oxygen and those who did not. None of our participants required intubation, mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or non-invasive ventilation. Conclusion: The AGM provides an early marker of gas exchange impairment in COVID-19. The data suggest that patients at risk of respiratory failure may be identified early, prior to obvious clinical deterioration in a rapid, non-invasive fashion. Such strategies may be helpful in the triage of patients or for enrolling high risk patients into interventional clinical trials.","output":"The Use of the Alveolar Gas Meter for Assessment of Gas Exchange Abnormalities in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The total defence (TD) concept aims to provide an effective crisis response structure by increasing society resilience. However, the complexity of its structure regarding resource mobilization and management process highlights the need for a complexity-oriented approach in the operationalising of TD.

The Division of tropical and humanitarian medicine of the Geneva University Hospitals runs a specific consultation for parasitic screening of immunosuppressed or pre-immunosuppressed patients. We sought to determine the seroprevalence of LTBI and LPI in such patients and explore its relationship with country of origin or previous travel in a retrospective, single-centre observational study from 2016 to 2019. Demographic data, travel history, ongoing treatments and results of the parasitological (Strongyloides stercoralis, Trypanosoma cruzi, Echinococcus multilocularis, Entamoeba histolytica and Leishmania spp.) and TB screening were collected to calculate LPI or LTBI prevalence. Risk factors for LTBI and strongyloidiasis were analysed using Poisson regression with robust variance. Among 406 eligible patients, 24/353 (6.8%) had LTBI, 8/368 (2.2%) were positive for Strongyloides stercoralis infection, 1/32 (3.1%) was positive for Entamoeba histolytica and 1/299 (0.3%) was positive for Leishmaniasis. No cases of Trypanosoma cruzi (0/274) or Echinococcus multilocularis (0/56) infection were detected. Previous travel to or originating from high-prevalence countries was a risk factor for LTBI (PR = 3.4, CI 95%: 1.4C8.2 and 4.0, CI 95%: 1.8C8.9, respectively). The prevalence of serological Strongyloidiasis in immunosuppressed patients is lower in comparison to those without immunosuppression (PR = 0.1, CI 95%: 0.01C0.8). In conclusion, screening before immunosuppression needs to be individualized, and LTBI and LPI need to be ruled out in patients who originate from or have travelled to high-prevalence countries. The sensitivity of strongyloidiasis serology is reduced following immunosuppression, so an algorithm combining different tests or presumptive treatment should be considered.","output":"Screening for Parasitic Infection and Tuberculosis in Immunosuppressed and Pre-Immunosuppressed Patients: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional predisposition to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Zinc deficiency could be critical since it is associated with a higher susceptibility to infections. We evaluated the prevalence of hypozincemia in the early stage of COVID-19, its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19 and its prognostic value for hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days. METHODS: For 152 COVID-19 patients and 88 non-COVID-19 patients admitted to COVID-19 screening centers, national early warning score for COVID-19 (NEWS) and laboratory analyses were performed to identify the risk for severe COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed whether hypozincemia was an independent predictor of hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days (primary judgment criterion). The secondary judgment criteria were high NEWS score (7), comorbidities and biomarkers associated with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Hypozincemia was more frequent in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (27.6% vs 11.4%; p = 0.003). Older patients (65 years) and medically assisted nursing home residents were at higher risk of hypozincemia (p < 0.01). Hypozincemia was associated with a worse NEWS score (p < 0.01) and lymphopenia (p < 0.001). Hypozincemia was independently associated with hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days (OR = 10.9, 95% CI = 2.3C51.6, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of COVID-19, the prevalence of hypozincemia exceeded 20%. Hypozincemia was an independent predictor of hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days. This may suggest the importance of early detection and treatment of zinc deficiency in the nutritional management of COVID-19, especially in older people.

The aim of this research is to study early psychological responses to the pandemic in the Spanish general population, focusing on gender differences. METHODS: Nine to 14 days after the declaration of a state of emergency an online survey was conducted assessing sociodemographic, health, behavioral and COVID-19-related variables. Mental health status was evaluated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Self-Care Scale (SCS). RESULTS: The study included 3520 respondents: 2611 women and 909 men. Women scored significantly higher in DASS-21 and IES-R (p &lt; 0.05) and were more likely to somatize, suffer from hypochondriasis, sleeping disturbances and claustrophobia (p &lt; 0.05). Being a woman can be considered a risk factor for intrusive thoughts, avoidance mechanisms, stress and anxiety (Odd Ratio = 2.7/2.3/2.3/1.6). The risk of presenting posttraumatic symptoms and emotional distress was greater in women (Odd Ratio = 6.77/4.59). General linear models to predict IES-R and DASS-21 scores clarified which variables were gender specific, such as main concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that at early stages of the pandemic, women mental health was more impacted and that both genders show different concerns.

Two vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine (recombinant), i.e., COVISHIELD produced by Serum Institute of India and COVAXIN developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech, were given emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the DCGI. Methods In this cohort study, we assessed the incidence, pattern and severity of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) observed among the healthcare workers of a large tertiary care institute in eastern U.P., India vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Coronavirus vaccine (recombinant) within 30 minutes of vaccination by direct observation. Results Out of the total 836 healthcare workers who were vaccinated with the first dose of the vaccine, around 10% experienced any AEFI within the directly observed period. The most common AEFI was pain/tenderness at the injection site experienced by 59.3% of those who experienced any AEFI followed by headache/dizziness (35.3%), itching/rashes at the injection site (8.1%), nausea/vomiting (5.8%) and fever/chills (4.7%).

METHODS: Information on Covid-19 patients was retrieved from the Italian IQVIA? Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD), a computerized network of general practitioners (GPs) including anonymous data on patients' consultations and treatments. All patients with a Covid-19 diagnosis during March 18th, 2020 - June 30th, 2020 were included in the study. The date of first Covid-19 registration was the starting point of the 3-month follow-up (Index Date). Patients were classified based on Covid-19-related pneumonia registrations on the Index date and/or during follow-up presence/absence. Each patient was assigned individual exposure by calculating average PM10 during the 30-day period preceding the Index Date, and according to GP's office province. A multiple generalized linear mixed model, mixed-effects logistic regression, was used to assess the association between PM10 exposure tertiles and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 6483 Covid-19 patients included, 1079 (16.6%) had a diagnosis of pneumonia. Pneumonia patients were older, more frequently men, more health-impaired, and had a higher individual-level exposure to PM10 during the month preceding Covid-19 diagnosis. The mixed-effects model showed that patients whose PM10 exposure level fell in the second tertile had a 30% higher likelihood of having pneumonia than that of first tertile patients, and the risk for those who were in the third tertile was almost doubled.

We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. METHODS: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment.

Previous studies acknowledge that the poor design of communities and social environments leads to increased psychological distress, but methodological issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Recent public health, leisure and recreation studies have tried to determine the relationship between recreation opportunities and mental health. However, previous studies have heavily focused on individual contexts rather than national or regional levels; this is a major limitation. It is difficult to reflect the characteristics of community environments effectively with such limited studies, because social environments and infrastructure should be analyzed using a spatial perspective that goes beyond an individuals behavioral patterns. Other limitations include lack of socioeconomic context and appropriate data to represent the characteristics of a local community and its environment. To date, very few studies have tested the spatial relationships between mental health and recreation opportunities on a national level, while controlling for a variety of competing explanations (e.g., the social determinants of mental health). To address these gaps, this study used multi-level spatial data combined with various sources to: (1) identify variables that contribute to spatial disparities of mental health; (2) examine how selected variables influence spatial mental health disparities using a generalized linear model (GLM); (3) specify the spatial variation of the relationships between recreation opportunities and mental health in the continental U.S. using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The findings suggest that multiple factors associated with poor mental health days, particularly walkable access to local parks, showed the strongest explanatory power in both the GLM and GWR models. In addition, negative relationships were found with educational attainment, racial/ethnic dynamics, and lower levels of urbanization, while positive relationships were found with poverty rate and unemployment in the GLM.

METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL between May and June 2020. All patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent clinical TCD ultrasonography for microemboli detection were included. RESULTS: A total of eight TCD studies were performed in six patients with COVID-19 (4 men and 2 women, median age 655), four with confirmed ischemic stroke and two with refractory encephalopathy. Microemboli were detected in three male patients, two patients had suffered a confirmed ischemic stroke and one who developed prolonged encephalopathy. Microemboli of varying intensity were identified in multiple vascular territories in two patients, and microemboli persisted despite therapeutic anticoagulation in a third patient. Of the three patients without evidence of microemboli on TCD ultrasonography, two patients had suffered a confirmed ischemic stroke, while one remained with refractory encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: TCD ultrasonography for microemboli detection identified three patients with confirmed COVID-19 with evidence of cerebral arterial microemboli, including one who was therapeutically anticoagulated. TCD ultrasonography provides a non-invasive method for evaluating cerebral microemboli in patients with COVID-19 and may be useful in assessing response to treatment in cases with suspected or confirmed disorders of hypercoagulability. Further studies investigating the prevalence of cerebral microemboli and associated risk factors are needed to characterize their pathogenic mechanism and guide therapeutic interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","output":"Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Evidence of Active Cerebral Embolization in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Optimization of CT scan practices can help achieve and maintain optimal radiation protection. The aim was to assess centering, scan length, and positioning of patients undergoing chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia and to investigate their effect on associated radiation doses. METHODS: With respective approvals from institutional review boards, we compiled CT imaging and radiation dose data from four hospitals belonging to four countries (Brazil, Iran, Italy, and USA) on 400 adult patients who underwent chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia between April 2020 and August 2020. We recorded patient demographics and volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) and dose length product (DLP). From thin-section CT images of each patient, we estimated the scan length and recorded the first and last vertebral bodies at the scan start and end locations. Patient mis-centering and arm position were recorded. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The extent and frequency of patient mis-centering did not differ across the four CT facilities (>0.09). The frequency of patients scanned with arms by their side (11C40% relative to those with arms up) had greater mis-centering and higher CTDI(vol) and DLP at 2/4 facilities (p = 0.027C0.05). Despite lack of variations in effective diameters (p = 0.14), there were significantly variations in scan lengths, CTDI(vol) and DLP across the four facilities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mis-centering, over-scanning, and arms by the side are frequent issues with use of chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia and are associated with higher radiation doses.","output":"Investigating centering, scan length, and arm position impact on radiation dose across 4 countries from 4 continents during pandemic: Mitigating key radioprotection issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo: A pandemia por COVID-19 representa um dos maiores desafios da sade pblica deste sculo, causando impactos na sade e nas condies de vida das populaes em todo o mundo.

METHODS: All cases included in this retrospective study from January 10, 2020 to March 15, 2020 were confirmed by laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2. Data of epidemiological characteristics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records and compared between the patient groups. RESULTS: A correlation analysis was performed to detect correlations between the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and other laboratory findings. COVID-19 patients treated in Wuhan more commonly had fever and shortness of breath, and less commonly had headache compared to those treated in Zhoushan (P=0.002, 0.039, and 0.015, respectively). The period from illness onset to hospitalization in Wuhan was 11.77.2 days, which was longer than that in Zhoushan (4.23.7 days; P=0.002), whereas the period from illness onset to shortness of breath in Wuhan was 5.45.0 days, which was shorter than that in Zhoushan (14.05.6 days; P=0.020). Computed tomography scans showed linear opacities, reticulation, and patchy shadows more commonly in cases treated in Wuhan (P=0.016, 0.013, and 0.008, respectively). The mean CRP level in Zhoushan patients was lower than that in Wuhan patients (P<0.001), and the CRP level was correlated with several laboratory findings related to the immune response. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients treated at Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Gutian campus had more severe symptoms than those treated at Zhoushan Hospital. Earlier in-hospital treatment, as conducted in Zhoushan, may be beneficial in reducing the severity of illness in COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to clarify whether pelvic floor PC affected short-term outcomes. METHODS The study group comprised patients with the pathologically confirmed diagnosis of rectal cancer who underwent E-LAR with pelvic floor PC or with no PC (NPC) between January 2013 and December 2018 in Southwest Hospital. After propensity score matching (PSM), 584 patients (292 who underwent PC and 292 who underwent NPC) were evaluated. Postoperative indicators, including the rates of complications, anastomotic leakage (AL), reoperation, and inflammation, were observed in the two groups. RESULTS No significant difference was observed in the rates of postoperative complications between the PC and NPC groups. The rates of AL were similar (11.3% vs. 9.2%, p = .414). However, the reoperation rate of patients in the PC group was significantly lower than that of patients in the NPC group after AL (36.4% vs. 11.1%, p = .025). The hospital costs were higher in the NPC leakage subgroup (p = .001). Additionally, the serum C-reactive protein levels were lower in the PC group on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 5, whereas procalcitonin levels on POD 1 and 3 were lower in the PC group but did not differ significantly on POD 5. CONCLUSION Pelvic peritonization did not affect the rate of complications, especially AL; however, it effectively reduced the reoperation and inflammation rates and reduced hospitalization costs.

To protect and enhance the ability of HCPs to perform their role in responding to COVID-19, healthcare authorities must help to alleviate the level of stress and anxiety amongst HCPs and the community. This will improve the knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19, especially for HCPs. In addition, authorities need to comply in treating this virus by implementing control measures and other precautions. This study explores the knowledge, attitude, anxiety, and preventive behaviours among Yemeni HCPs towards COVID-19. Methods: : A descriptive, web-based-cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,231 Yemeni HCPs. The COVID-19 related questionnaire was designed using Google forms where the responses were coded and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software package (IBM SPSS), version 22.0. Descriptive statistics and Pearsons correlation coefficient test were also employed in this study. A p -value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.

Inflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested as possible pathophysiological mechanisms leading to vascular and endothelial deregulation after COVID-19 infection. PURPOSE: The objective of our study is to evaluate premature alterations in arterial stiffness, endothelial, coronary, and myocardial function markers four months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a case-control prospective study, including 70 patients four months after COVID-19 infection, 70 age- and sex-matched untreated hypertensive patients (positive control) and 70 healthy individuals. We measured a) perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced endothelial glycocalyx thickness b) flow-mediated dilation (FMD), c) coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) by Doppler echocardiography d) pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central systolic (SBP) e) global LV longitudinal strain (GLS) by speckle tracking imaging and f) malondialdehyde (MDA) as oxidative stress marker. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had similar CFR and FMD with hypertensives (2.480.41 vs 2.580.88, p=0.562, 5.862.82% vs 5.802.07%, p=0.872 respectively), but lower CFR and FMD than controls (3.420.65, p=0.0135 9.062.11%, p=0.002 respectively) Both COVID-19 and hypertensive group had greater PBR than controls (PBR5C25: 2.070.15 m and 2.070.26 m p=0.8 vs 1.890.17 m, p=0.001). COVID-19 patients and hypertensives had higher PWV and central SBP than controls (PWVcf 12.092.50 and 11.922.94, p=0.7 vs 10.041.80 m/sec, p=0.036). COVID-19 patients and hypertensives had impaired values of GLS compared to controls (?19.502.56% and ?19.232.67%, p=0.864 vs ?21.981.51%, p=0.020). Increased PBR5C25 was associated with increased SBP central which in turn was related with impaired GLS (p<0.05). MDA was found increased in COVID-19 patients compared to both hypertensives and controls (10.672.75 vs 1.760.30, p=0.003 vs 1.010.50 nmole/L, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may cause impaired coronary microcirculatory, endothelial and vascular deregulation which remain four months after initial infection and are associated with reduced cardiac performance. The 10-fold increase of MDA compared to healthy individuals four months after COVID-19 infection indicate oxidative stress as possible pathophysiological mechanism.

Many data analysis methods for cytometry data focus solely on identifying subpopulations via clustering and testing for differential cell abundance.

Here, we systematically evaluated existing and novel approaches for differential expression analysis on real and simulated CyTOF data.

Methods using all data detect changes in strongly zero-inflated markers, but partially suffer from overprediction or cannot handle big datasets. We present a new method, CyEMD, based on calculating the Earth Movers Distance between expression distributions that can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

However, while camostat and nafamostat inhibit TMPRSS2 by forming a covalent adduct, the mode of action of bromhexine remains unclear. TMPRSS2 is autocatalytically activated from its inactive form, zymogen, through a proteolytic cleavage that promotes the binding of Ile256 to a putative allosteric pocket (A-pocket). Computer simulations, reported here, indicate that Ile256 binding induces a conformational change in the catalytic site, thus providing the atomistic rationale to the activation process of the enzyme. Furthermore, computational docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that bromhexine competes with the N-terminal Ile256 for the same binding site, making it a potential allosteric inhibitor.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance is the gold standard for evaluating the risk of EOS. However, there are concerns regarding the high volume of preemptive antibiotic use.The Kaiser Permanente (KP) Sepsis Risk Calculator (SRC) is a tool that generates a risk score based on multiple variables including both maternal risk factors and clinical presentation of the baby at birth.A pilot program introducing use of the SRC over NICE guidance to guide the use of antibiotics in infants of 34 weeks gestation on the postnatal ward (PNW). It was implemented in our level 2 neonatal unit from 6th April to 5th June 2020, coinciding with the initial peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK.ObjectivesTo evaluate the:1. Impact of new protocol on clinical outcomes2. Rate of missed cases of sepsis in our cohortMethodsRetrospective cohort study comparing infants 34 weeks of gestation admitted to the PNW pre- and post-SRC implementation. Primary outcome was number of infants who received antibiotics for suspected EOS. Secondary outcomes were duration of initial hospital admission and safety. Safety was assessed by the number of missed cases C defined as infants who required antibiotics >24 hours and 7 days of age for EOS (defined as positive culture OR negative culture treated with 5 days of intravenous antibiotics) and either death, admission to the neonatal unit during the initial hospital episode, continuing treatment on the PNW or re-admission following initial discharge. Incidence of missed cases was monitored for an additional period (September-December 2020).ResultsIn June-July 2019 (pre SRC pilot), there were 750 live births 34 weeks gestation and 104 babies 34 weeks admitted to the postnatal ward who received antibiotics (13.9%). In April-May 2020 (post SRC introduction), there were 698 live births 34 weeks gestation and six postnatal babies 34 weeks received antibiotics (0.9%;risk reduction 87%). In the post SRC cohort, 46 babies would have received antibiotics under NICE guidance but were not preemptively treated for sepsis following SRC. There were no missed cases and average length of stay decreased from 3.3 days to 2.2 days post SRC implementation. Additionally, 73 babies born between September-November 2020 underwent KP SRC. There was one missed case but the blood culture was negative.ConclusionsThe marked reduction of antibiotic use led to shorter average initial hospital stay and this was particularly important in the post-SRC group for mothers who were without their birthing partner due to the Covid-19 visiting restrictions.Our department continues to use the SRC to guide preemptive antibiotic use in infants born34 weeks and admitted to the postnatal ward. Safety outcome monitoring continues and we are participating in a pan-London EOS observational study which aims to be sufficiently powered to assess safety comparison data between SRC and NICE guidance.","output":"Use of a neonatal sepsis risk calculator reduces antibiotic use and hospital admission length: implementation of a DGH pilot programme during the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two iboga-vobasine bisindoles, 16'-decarbomethoxyvoacamine (1: ) and its 19,20-dihydro derivative, 16'-decarbomethoxydihydrovoacamine (2: ) from Tabernaemontana corymbosa exhibited potent cytotoxicity against the human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells in our previous studies.

Using a qualitative case\\\\study design, this presentation will highlight the experience of migrating exercise physiology labs into a virtual post\\\\secondary course context. In Fall 2020, approximately 200 Kinesiology students attended a virtual second\\\\year exercise physiology course, which included four previously in\\\\person, bi\\\\weekly labs. Labs were rapidly migrated onto an open access platform for integration into the existing institutional learning management system. Students completed bi\\\\weekly labs in lab groups of 20\\\\25 students, led by a Teaching Assistant (TA), with students working in small breakout groups of 4\\\\5 students to complete the virtual lab as a group using a collaborative workspace. Following the breakouts, students would rejoin their peers in the main group for a post\\\\lab discussion period to discuss lab report questions with the TA. After the lab, students completed a content quiz which included a responsive question: What did you like about the lab? What do you feel could be improved about the lab? Given the importance of considering students as partners in course development, responses from students were considered in refinement of future virtual labs throughout the term. Responses were analyzed using qualitative coding for positive/neutral/negative responses, and general themes emerged for each lab. Briefly, main themes for improvement included: increased organization and instruction for navigating the virtual lab, more contact with the TA in breakout rooms, improving engagement between members of breakout groups, and enhancements to the virtual lab components. Positive themes included: students enjoying breakout room opportunities to connect with peers, TA support especially in the post\\\\lab discussion period, and additional cues added to the virtual lab. Finally, student responses became increasingly positive from the first lab to fourth lab, with students noting their appreciation for being a part of the refinement process.

Our preceding pilot data identified six high-yield topics for this setting: venous thromboembolism, oncologic emergencies, sickle cell disease, hematologic emergencies, brain metastases, and spinal metastases. This study objective was to determine if the addition of educational screencasts on these six topics would be an effective educational intervention for trainees on a busy HOS. METHODS: All internal medicine residents scheduled to start a rotation on an HOS were eligible. Participants underwent block randomization to the usual educational curriculum either with screencast access (treatment) or without it (control). Allocation was concealed but participants were not blinded. Upon completion of the rotation, all participants received an anonymous online survey about their experiences. The primary outcome was the change in attitude among learners, measured as their self-reported confidence for managing the clinical topics that were covered. All randomized participants received a $20 gift certificate upon completion of the study. Exploratory data was also collected from medical students, fellows, and faculty who opted to participate;they were given access to the screencasts without randomization. RESULTS: Over the 29 week study period (12/9/2019 - 6/30/2020), 67 out of 78 eligible residents (86%) opted to participate;these 67 residents all underwent randomization and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. Enrollment continued to completion of the study. The final participant response rate was high at 91%. Demographic characteristics were well-matched between the arms with the exception of a higher prevalence of male gender (72% vs. 42%, p=0.022) in the screencast arm. The majority (64%) of residents in the screencast arm rated their clinical management comfort level as either comfortable or very comfortable as compared to just 21% of residents in the usual education arm (p = 0.0008), estimated difference = 43%, (95% CI 21%,66%) using a prespecified cumulative cutoff score. Nearly all participants on the screencast arm either agreed or strongly agreed that the screencasts improved their knowledge base in medical oncology (100%), will improve their care for cancer patients (92%), and enjoyed the format (96%). Most participants on the screencast arm felt that the intervention was optimal in terms of content (96%), length (82%), and accessibility (63%). Preferred viewing speed for the screencasts was 1.5x (52%). Nearly all participants felt that a similar database of screencasts would be helpful for all of their clinical rotations (96%). Medical knowledge as tested by a series of 6 clinical vignette multiple-choice questions was not different between the screencast and control arms (percentage correct: 77% vs. 80%, p=0.56). Burnout as tested by the Maslach Burnout Inventory was not different between the screencast and control arms in terms of total score (71  12 vs. 69  13, p=0.67) or personal accomplishment subscale (46 vs. 45, p=0.71). Exploratory data was also collected from 6 medical students, 8 fellows, and 6 attendings. Half of the students (50%) recommended the screencasts for the IM clerkship. Most fellows and faculty were neutral as to their interest in producing their own educational screencasts (77%) or contributing to a similar project (54%). CONCLUSIONS Resident trainees on a busy inpatient adult hematology-oncology service (HOS) found that a JiTT screencast series increased their clinical comfort level in the management of critical and commonly encountered patient problems unique to the HOS. The screencast content and delivery was overwhelmingly positive with nearly all (96%) wanting screencast series to be created for all their clinical rotations.

We studied the nationwide impact of COVID-19 on kidney transplantation in Austria during the first six months of 2020.

RESULTS: Recent studies have revealed that both SARS CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade target cells through a membrane-bound angiotensin-convert enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which maintains human homeostasis, whereas MERS utilizes host cells' receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for entry.

Not only does this change the performance of the transport network, it also means that the way in which transport modellers and planners use models estimated on a typical weekday of travel and expand it up to the week and the year must be questioned and appropriately revised to adjust for the quantum of working from home. Although teleworking is not a new phenomenon, what is new is the ferocity by which it has been imposed on individuals throughout the world, and the expectation that working from home is no longer a temporary phenomenon but one that is likely to continue to some non-marginal extent given its acceptance and revealed preferences from both many employees and employ where working from home makes good sense. This paper formalises the relationship between working from home and commuting by day of the week and time of day for two large metropolitan areas in Australia, Brisbane and Sydney, using a mixed logit choice model, identifying the influences on such choices together with a mapping model between the probability of working from home and socioeconomic and other contextual influences that are commonly used in strategic transport models to predict demand for various modes by location.

A better understanding of how well these schemes work is needed. This paper is based on a study (01/2020C12/2021) of the health-related processes and outcomes linked to the rehousing of older social housing tenants in Hackney/London through four local authority-supported schemes: Downsizing;Regeneration;Housing Moves;Seaside & Country Homes.MethodsA mixed methods design entailed a scoping review, based on a search of scientific databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO) and the grey literature, and a narrative synthesis of results. Interviews with practice-based stakeholders across sectors (n=11) were conducted. A survey of older social housing tenants who have moved through a rehousing scheme (n=766), analysed in Excel, generated descriptive statistics and themes for qualitative exploration. A Photovoice component with 16 survey participants, currently underway, has been designed to capture the participants rehousing experience and its effect on their lives. It entails interviews and focus groups. Interviews and a focus group are being conducted with older social housing tenants who were interested in being rehoused, but opted against moving (non-movers;n=5). All qualitative data are analysed thematically in NVivo12. All methods have been adjusted to comply with Covid-19 rules.ResultsThe review yielded three peer-reviewed papers and 13 reports, thus revealing a gap in knowledge around the health-related effects of rehousing older social housing tenants. Interviews with practice-based stakeholders highlighted promising approaches in the rehousing schemes, such as highly personalised support, and challenges, including a lack of suitable homes for tenants to move into. The survey yielded 62 valid responses (8.1%). As well as helpful elements (e.g. being given choices) and challenges (e.g. poor communication) in the rehousing process, it identified welcome (e.g. a warmer home) and unwelcome (e.g. loneliness) health and wellbeing outcomes. The findings will be broken down by rehousing scheme. They will be supplemented by detailed insights from the Photovoice components and data collection with non-movers.ConclusionThe study was designed to generate insights that can inform efforts by Hackney Council and other social housing providers to improve rehousing schemes for older tenants and optimise their health-related effects.

This points out the importance of combining ecological immunology and oxidative stress ecology to further our understanding of the proximate causes and fitness consequences of individual variation in health, and adaptability to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. I reviewed evidence and performed phylogenetic meta-analyses of changes in oxidative status markers owing to either injection of an antigen or infection in captive and free-living vertebrates (141 studies, 1262 effect sizes, 97 species). The dataset was dominated by studies on fish, birds and mammals, which provided 95.8% of effect sizes. Both antigen injection and parasite exposure were associated with changes of oxidative status. There were significant effects of taxonomic class and experimental environment (captivity vs. wild). In contrast with my predictions, age category (young vs. adult), study design (correlational vs. experimental) and proxies of pace of life (clutch size, litter size, and body mass; for birds and mammals only) were negligible in this dataset. Several methodological aspects (type of immunostimulant, laboratory assay, tissue analysed) showed significant effects on both strength and direction of effect. My results suggest that alterations of oxidative status are a widespread consequence of immune function across vertebrates. However, this work also identified heterogeneity in strength and direction of effect sizes, which suggests that immune function does not necessarily result in oxidative stress.

Based on documentary, survey and interview material with IEC participants, we investigate how the IEC regulatory framework influences the employment and immigration experiences of these young workers. We argue that, instead of being a form of privileged youth mobility, the IEC is composed of multiple regulations resulting in significant variations in conditions of admission and stay among migrant workers.

Despite well-established efficacy of group psychosocial therapies targeting cognitive health in SSDs, dissemination of these programs remains limited. Remote delivery offers a promising strategy for increasing the programs' accessibility. Yet, little research has evaluated group therapies for cognitive health delivered in this way. Thus, we aimed to assess, from participants' and therapists' perspectives, the feasibility, acceptability, as well as levels and process of engagement in a videoconference delivery of group psychosocial therapies for SSD patients' cognitive health. Participants, outpatients, attended Action Based Cognitive Remediation or Metacognitive Training, both adapted for videoconference. Then, participants and therapists completed post-therapy questionnaires. Of the 28 participants attending at least one session, 75% completed more than half of sessions and seven dropped out. Technology did not appear to significantly hinder participation in the programs. All completing participants reported a positive experience with therapy, 67% were not bothered by the distance from the therapist, and 77% trusted that the information shared was kept confidential. Therapist-rated levels of attention M = 7.5/9 (SD = 1.04), participation M = 6.91/9 (SD = 1.32), and social interactions M = 5.31/9 (SD = 1.96) were satisfactory. Nonetheless, participants indicated that they would have appreciated more social interactions with group members.

In the industrial sector, spatial agglomeration effects are typical, but such changes in the patterns of crop types and diversity would have major implications for the resilience of food systems to global change. Here, we investigate the extent to which agricultural industrialization in the US was accompanied by agglomeration of crop types, not just overall cropland area, as well as declines in crop diversity. Based on county-level analyses of individual crop land cover area in the conterminous US from 1840 to 2017, we found a strong and abrupt spatial concentration of most crop types in very recent years. For 13 of the 18 major crops, the widespread belts that characterized early-20th century US agriculture have collapsed, with spatial concentration increasing 15-fold after 2002. The number of counties producing each crop declined from 1940-2017 by up to 97%, and their total area declined by up to 98%, despite increasing total production. Concomitantly, the diversity of crop types within counties plummeted: in 1940, 88% of counties grew > 10 crops, but only 2% did so in 2017, and combinations of crop types that once characterized entire agricultural regions are lost. Importantly, declining crop diversity with increasing cropland area is a recent phenomenon, suggesting that corresponding environmental effects in agriculturally dominated counties have fundamentally changed. For example, the spatial concentration of agriculture has important consequences for the spread of crop pests, agrochemical use and climate change. Ultimately, the recent collapse of most agricultural belts and the loss of crop diversity suggest greater vulnerability of US food systems to environmental and economic change, but the spatial concentration of agriculture may also offer environmental benefits in areas that are no longer farmed.","output":"Recent collapse of crop belts and declining diversity of US agriculture since 1840."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global food supply chain (starting at farms and ending with consumers) has been seriously disrupted by many outlier events such as trade wars, the China demand shock, natural disasters, and pandemics.

Evidencing it, emergency departments in hospitals are examples of such complex environments that need perfect integration among systems, people, departments, and data. The processes behind the Emergency Department (ED) routine cause a set of critical and time-dependent decision-making, which must consider several criteria related to organizational and clinical attributes. Based on the literature and worldwide initiatives related to managing complex organizations, an ED can be interpreted through the enterprise interoperability (EI) lens, a concept related to the capability of different systems to work collaboratively within and throughout the organization. Thus, this paper proposes a framework focusing on interoperability assessment in ED processes, where different actors need to interoperate. The proposed framework for Enterprise Interoperability Assessment (EIA) is based on multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, considering organizational and clinical attributes of the ED. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), in an integrated approach, were elected as the most appropriate multicriteria methods to support, respectively, diagnostic (interoperability assessment) and decisional (interoperability improvements) processes in this background.

The present study aimed to assess the status of antioxidants malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) (reduced), catalase, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in chronic OP-exposed groups from Cameroon and Pakistan. Molecular analysis of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) of glutathione transferases (GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1), catalase gene (CAT, rs7943316), sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1, rs10823108), acetylcholinesterase gene (ACHE, rs2571598), and butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE, rs3495) were screened in the OP-exposed individuals to find the possible causative association with oxidative stress and toxicity. Cholinesterase and antioxidant activities were measured by colorimetric methods using a spectrophotometer. Salting-out method was employed for DNA extraction from blood followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for molecular analysis. Cholinergic enzymes were significantly decreased in OP-exposed groups. Catalase and SOD were decreased and MDA and FRAP were increased in OP-exposed groups compared to unexposed groups in both groups. GSH was decreased only in Pakistani OPs-exposed group. Molecular analysis of ACHE, BCHE, Catalase, GSTP1, and GSTM1 SNPs revealed a tentative association with their phenotypic expression that is level of antioxidant and cholinergic enzymes.

It originated in sub-Saharan Africa and was especially contagious to doctors and caregivers. No remedies were effective. But the few survivors who were reexposed to diseased patients were not attacked a second time, suggesting protective immunity. What lessons can we learn from the ancient outbreak that bears a clinical and epidemiologic resemblance to Ebola? The historian Thucydides, an eyewitness and disease sufferer, described how the unsuspecting city panicked as it struggled to handle the rapidly spreading, devastating disease. Moreover, he stressed a theme that has relevance todaynamely, that fear and panic intensified the disruption of society and damage to the individual that was directly caused by the disease. Moreover, fear amplified the spread of disease. The destructive nature of fear has remained a signature feature of pestilences that have subsequently caught ill-prepared societies off-guardBubonic plague in medieval times, AIDS in the 1980s, and Ebola today.

METHODS: In this retrospective study we identified patients with acute respiratory failure who were evaluated for AEX-IPF at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2002 and December 2011. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed with predefined risk factors and final diagnosis of AEX-IPF and pulmonary infection. All tests were performed at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Of these patients 47 (61 %) were diagnosed with AEX-IPF. Bronchoscopy was more likely to be performed in patients who were on cytotoxic medications (p < 0.05).

However, the epidemiology and predictors of CMV reactivation in immunocompetent patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and predictors of CMV reactivation in immunocompetent patients requiring MV. METHODS: A single-center, prospective observational study (conducted from June 30, 2017 to July 01, 2018) with a follow-up of 90 days (September 29, 2018) that included 71 CMV-seropositive immunocompetent patients with MV at a 37-bed university hospital general intensive care unit (ICU) in China. Routine detection of CMV DNAemia was performed once a week for 28 days (Days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28). CMV serology, laboratory findings, and clinical data were obtained during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 71 patients, 13 (18.3%) showed CMV reactivation within 28 days in the ICU. The median time to reactivation was 7 days. CMV reactivation was related to various factors, including body mass index (BMI), sepsis, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels (P < 0.05). In the multivariate regression model, BMI, Hb level, and sepsis were independently associated with CMV reactivation patients (P < 0.05). Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of BMI, Hb, and BMI combined with Hb was 0.69, 0.70, and 0.76, respectively. The duration of MV, hospitalization expense, length of ICU stay, and 90 day all-cause mortality rate in patients with CMV reactivation was significantly higher than in those without CMV reactivation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among immunocompetent patients with MV, the incidence of CMV reactivation was 18.3%. CMV reactivation was associated with several adverse prognoses. BMI, Hb, and sepsis were independent risk factors for CMV reactivation. BMI and Hb may predict CMV reactivation.

The gasless abdominal wall-lifting method for laparoscopic splenectomy was introduced as an alternative. This retrospective study was undertaken to compare results using the two techniques. METHODS Between 1995 and 2010, 54 patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy at a single institution; 30 underwent the procedure using the gasless technique and 24 using pneumoperitoneum. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex or BMI, but more patients underwent concurrent operations in the pneumoperitoneum group. The abdominal wall-lift system with subcutaneous K-wires was used for the gasless method. RESULTS Intraoperative blood loss was similar in the two groups (193.0  196.7 mL gasless, 217.3  296.6 mL pneumoperitoneum; P > 0.05), but operative time (182.1  92.1 min, 135.1  46.1 min; P < 0.05), and resected spleen weight (306.1  297.7 g, 138  81.0 g; P < 0.05) were significantly different.

Soon after that, the world health organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 a global health concern. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a lethal respiratory infection as well as the involvement of other organs due to its large tropism spectrum such as neurologic, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. Since the behavior of the virus is not fully understood, a new manifestation of the infection is revealed every day. In order to be able to design more efficient drugs and vaccines to treat the infection, finding out the exact mechanism of pathogenicity would be necessary. Although there have been some big steps toward understanding the relevant process, there are still some deficiencies in this field. Accordingly, regenerative medicine (RM), can offer promising opportunities in discovering the exact mechanisms and specific treatments. For instance, since it is not always possible to catch the pathophysiology mechanisms in human beings, several modeling methods have been introduced in this field that can be studied in three main groups: stem cell-based models, organoids, and animal models. Regarding stem cell-based models, induced pluripotent stem cells are the major study subjects, which are generated by reprogramming the somatic stem cells and then directing them into different adult cell populations to study their behavior toward the infection. In organoid models, different cell lines can be guided to produce a 3D structure including liver, heart, and brain-like platforms. Among animal models, mice are the most common species in this field. However, in order for mice models to be permissive to the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, the main receptor involved in the pathogenicity of the virus, should be introduced to the host cells through different methods. Here, the current known mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, different suggested models, the specific response toward different manipulation as well as challenges and shortcomings in each case have been reviewed. Finally, we have tried to provide a quick summary of the present available RM-based models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as an essential part of developing drugs, for future therapeutic goals.","output":"Recent Advances of COVID-19 Modeling Based on Regenerative Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical value of the chest CT scan compared to the reference standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in COVID-19 patients.

The performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed with reference to the RT-PCR result. Two board-certified radiologists (mean 24 years of experience chest CT), blinded for the RT-PCR result, reviewed all scans and decided positive or negative chest CT findings by consensus. RESULTS: Out of 240 patients, 60% (144/240) had positive RT-PCR results and 89% (213/240) had a positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 were 100% (95% CI: 97C100%, 144/240), 28% (95% CI: 19C38%, 27/240), 68% (95% CI: 65C70%) and 100%, respectively.

This paper presents a smart mask that allows to monitor body temperature and breathing rate. Body temperature is measured by a non-invasive dual-heat-flux system, consisting of four sensors separated from each other with an insulating material. Breathing rate is obtained from the temperature changes within the mask, measured with a thermistor located near the nose. The system communicates by means of long-range (LoRa) backscattering, leading to a reduction in average power consumption. It is designed to establish the relative location of the smart mask from the signal received at two LoRa receivers installed inside and outside an access door. Low-cost LoRa transceivers with WiFi capabilities are used in the prototype to collect information and upload it to a server.

Therefore, it is important to establish an accurate method to assist in the diagnosis of PQ poisoning, especially in the early stages. In this study, a gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry (GCCMS) metabonomics strategy was established to obtain metabolite information. A random forest algorithm was used to search for potential biomarkers of PQ poisoning, and data mining and network pharmacological analysis were used to evaluate the active components, drugCdisease targets, and key pathways of Xuebijing (XBJ) injection in the treatment of PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Targets from the network pharmacology analysis and metabolites from plasma metabolomics were jointly analyzed to select crucial metabolic pathways. Finally, molecular docking technology and in vitro experiments were used to verify the pathway targets to further reveal the potential mechanisms underlying the antipulmonary fibrosis effect of XBJ. Metabonomics studies showed that l-valine, glycine, citric acid, d-mannose, d-galactose, maltose, l-tryptophan, and arachidonic acid contributed more to the differentiation of different groups than other metabolites. Compared with the control group, the PQ poisoning group had higher levels of l-valine, glycine, citric acid, l-tryptophan, and arachidonic acid, and lower levels of d-mannose, d-galactose, and maltose. After treatment with XBJ injection, the relative levels of these metabolites were reversed. The network pharmacological analysis screened a total of 180 targets, mainly involving multiple signaling pathways and metabolic pathways, which jointly played an antipulmonary fibrosis effect. Based on the combined analysis of 180 targets and 8 different metabolites, arachidonic acid metabolism was selected as the key metabolic pathway.

We aimed to investigate whether ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 deaths were similar in the more recent second wave of the epidemic. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used primary care and linked ONS mortality data within the OpenSAFELY platform. All adults in the database at 1st September 2020 and with at least 1 year of prior follow-up and a record of ethnicity were included. The outcome was COVID-19-related death (death with COVID-19 listed as a cause of death on the death certificate). Follow-up was to 9th November 2020. Hazard ratios for ethnicity were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex, and then further adjusted for deprivation. 13,223,154 people were included. During the study period, people of South Asian ethnicity were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19 than white people after adjusting for age and sex (HR = 3.47, 95% CI 2.99-4.03); the association attenuated somewhat on further adjustment for index of multiple deprivation (HR = 2.86, 2.46-3.33, Table 2). In contrast with the first wave of the epidemic, we found little evidence of a raised risk in black or other ethnic groups compared to white (HR for black vs white = 1.28, 0.87-1.88 adjusted for age and sex; and 1.01, 0.69-1.49 further adjusted for deprivation).

We aimed to investigate what changes the COVID-19 pandemic can cause in patients with epilepsy on drug compliance and stigmatization. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Modified Morisky Scale (MMS) and stigmatization scales were used between October and November 2019 to assess drug compliance and stigmatization in epilepsy patients. These scales were renewed in June and July 2020 in the same patient group to assess the impact of the epidemic on drug compliance and stigmatization in patients with epilepsy. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in SPSS. The interviews were conducted during the interictal period. Paired-samples t-test was used to compare the stigma scale results of epilepsy patients before and during COVID-19. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare MMS groups before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the pre-pandemic and pandemic period in epilepsy stigma scale used to evaluate stigmatization levels in patients. During the pandemic period, it was observed that patients had higher motivation and higher knowledge than before the pandemic (pa?=a?0.048). There were seven patients (6.4%) whose seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. There were two patients (1.8%) who had difficulty in accessing drugs during the pandemic period. In multivariate analysis, only parameter that predicted an increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used In the of COVID-19 period. In correlation analysis, a negative correlation was found between the stigma total score during COVID-19 period and education level. CONCLUSION: A slight increase in the frequency of seizures was observed in our patients during the pandemic period, and no significant problem was experienced in accessing drugs.

In the UK formal handover is an established and well reported process in the clinical setting but less so in transfusion laboratories. Blood transfusions occur within many hospital specialities and across clinical and laboratory staff shifts, making robust handover critical for safe practice. Failure to adequately transfer information relating to pending or ongoing provision of blood components during shift handover in the laboratory can have an adverse impact on patient care. AIMS To identify transfusion errors where laboratory handover was considered a contributory factor. MATERIALS AND METHODS Serious adverse events and reactions reported to the UK haemovigilance scheme, Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT), involving handover in the transfusion laboratory were reviewed for a 6-year period. RESULTS Laboratory incidents involving handover were mainly associated with incorrect blood component transfused-specific requirements not met (IBCT-SRNM) and delays in provision of blood components transfusion, with 16.6% of these cases involving major haemorrhage situations. Handover was found to be insufficient in most cases, no handover was completed in 29.5% of cases, inadequate written handover accounted for 14.8% cases, and inadequate verbal for 5.7% of cases. DISCUSSION Poor handover can lead to laboratory errors, particularly delays in provision of blood components. Embedding effective handover processes in the laboratory and including handover time within the shift working pattern, may help reduce errors and ensure continuity of care. CONCLUSION Handover should be considered a task that is built into laboratory routine practices, ensuring effective transfer of information and appropriate follow up actions are taken.

However, its benefits in clinical practice are not demonstrated. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative pupillometry monitoring on perioperative opioid consumption in major gynecologic surgery. METHODS After receiving ethics committee approval and written consent of patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to II women undergoing gynecologic surgery were included in this single-blinded, prospective, parallel-arm randomized study. General anesthesia was standardized with propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. In the pupillometry group, remifentanil administration was guided by pupillary diameter changes. In the standard group, remifentanil administration was left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The primary outcome was intraoperative remifentanil consumption. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were analyzed. Remifentanil consumption was markedly decreased in the pupillometry group (3.8 [3.4 to 4.8 g  kg  h] vs. 7.9 g  kg  h [6.5 to 9.0 g  kg  h] in the standard group; difference = 4.2 g  kg  h [95% CI, 3.0 to 5.3 g  kg  h]; P < 0.001).

Using in vivo transplantation studies, we found that the HAMC delivery system results in a >45% increase in the number of donor-derived fibers as compared to saline delivery. We demonstrate that increases in donor-derived fibers when using HAMC are attributed to increased MuSC proliferation via a CD44-independent mechanism, preventing injected cell active clearance, and supporting in vivo expansion by delaying differentiation. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in donor fiber dispersion when MuSCs were delivered in HAMC.

SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2-expressing cells and gains cell entry through either direct plasma membrane fusion or endocytosis. Recent studies have shown that in addition to ACE2, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) also play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment by serving as an attachment factor. Binding of viral spike protein to HSPGs leads to the enrichment of local concentration for the subsequent specific binding with ACE2. We therefore hypothesize that blocking the interactions between viral spike protein and the HSPGs will lead to inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we report our findings of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the mechanism of action of lactoferrin (LF) against multiple common human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2. Our study has shown that LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E in cell culture, and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is more potent than human lactoferrin. Mechanistic studies revealed that BLF binds to HSPGs, thereby blocking viral attachment to the host cell. The antiviral activity of BLF can be antagonized by the HSPG mimetic heparin. Combination therapy experiment showed that the antiviral activity of LF is synergistic with remdesivir in cell culture.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that melatonin (Mel) protects against ischemic heart injury and arteriosclerosis. However, its role in endotoxemia-exposed cardiomyocytes remains poorly understood. This study explored, for the first time, the protective effect of Mel on the pyroptosis of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our results showed that treatment with 1 M or 10 M Mel for 12 h significantly improved 1 g/ml LPS-induced hiPSC-CM injuries, as reflected by drastically decreased LDH release and increased cell viability, which was accompanied by the overt induction of autophagy. Specifically, Mel profoundly alleviated LPS-induced cell pyroptosis, as evidenced by decreased propidium iodide (PI) and active caspase-1 double-positive cell rates; suppressed the expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 (activated form of caspase-1), and GSDMD-NT (functional N-terminal fragment of GSDMD) expression; and inhibited the production of the cleaved IL-1 and cleaved IL-18 cytokines. Additionally, double-membrane autophagosomes were observed in LPS-injured hiPSC-CMs treated with 1 M or 10 M Mel. The hiPSC-CMs treated with LPS exhibited considerably fewer acidic vesicles (as revealed by LAMP1 staining) and autophagosomes (as revealed by LC3-II staining); however, Mel reversed this outcome in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, coincubation with rapamycin (an autophagy activator) or 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor) accentuated and attenuated the antipyroptotic actions of Mel, respectively. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Mel shields hiPSC-CMs against pyroptosis during endotoxemia by activating autophagy.","output":"Melatonin Alleviates LPS-Induced Pyroptotic Cell Death in Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes by Activating Autophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: COVID-19 caused the world to shut down and made us to critically look out at our advanced healthcare systems that are well prepared for heart diseases, cancers, organ transplantation but not for attack of a tiny virus WHO and other authorized bodies are continuously issuing advisory on preventive measurements, tracking the outbreak and distributing vital medical kits Scientific community and vaccine experts have developed and started to distribute safe and effective immunization worldwide The paper outlines several developed and developing immunization vehicles for the management of COVID -19 that will hit global market in year 2021 Method: Non clinical and clinical data are collected from authentic sources of World Health Organization portal and press release provided by COVID-19 vaccine developers Result: Different platforms including mRNA, DNA, Viral vectors, Synthetic peptides etc have been conversed that are globally involved for elimination of SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus of COVID-19 Conclusion: Numerous academic institutions and companies of worldwide have developed and evaluated their inoculums after extremely compressed clinical trial agendas Worldwide eminent developers such as Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZenaca and Bharat Biotech are ready with their esteemed products for the management of pandemic COVID-19 They explored pharmaceutical technologies reliant on genetics, nanoengineering and biotechnology for successful development of these anti SARS-CoV-2 inoculums Taking account on conditions of more vulnerable community including immunocompromised, geriatrics and comorbidities patients the safety and efficacy of vaccine are yet to be monitored","output":"Current updates on COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed our daily lives and medical practices since it was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

It is particularly useful for employers to know how many employees have already contracted the infection and for how many people are still at risk of the coronavirus infection. For this purpose, it is appropriate to examine IgG antibodies. However, the testing strategy is different at present - antigen testing is mandatory to look for infectious individuals, regardless of human immunity. The aim of the pilot study was to determine the number of immune individuals after infection at three clinics of GENNET s.r.o. At the same time, unvaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 or had undergone it more than three months ago were tested with antigen tests. The cohort included 297 subjects, of whom 182 were not vaccinated (61.3 %) and 115 subjects (38.7 %) were after the vaccination. Of the unvaccinated, 71 people had in the past a positive PCR test (39 %), another 18 people had positive IgG antibodies without infection (9.9 %) and 38 people (20.9 %) had negative IgG antibodies. So far, 55 persons (30.2 %) have not been examined. If we add people vaccinated and people with antibodies, then 74.3 % of employees of the GENNET Archa clinic, 68 % of employees from the GENNET Kosteln clinic and 58.1 % from the GENNET Liberec clinic were immune to infection. 153 individuals on average (60 of whom had antibodies) were tested for the antigen test in four rounds. The infection was detected in two people. Both belonged to the group without tested antibodies. No person with antibodies was tested positive for antigen. People who have antibodies after vaccination or infection are substantially less prone to infection and have a low risk of continuing to spread the virus. By examining antibodies, employers will gain a better overview of the situation in the workplace.

Since there is still no specific treatment available, prevention of disease spread is crucial to manage the pandemic. Adequate public information is very important. To assess the optimal timing, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between web-based interest and new cases and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODS: Web-based interest for queries related to 'coronavirus' was assessed between 1 January and 19 June 2020, using Google Trends in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Reliability analysis of the used search terms was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. To investigate the association between web-based interest and new COVID-19 cases or deaths, the relative search volume was analysed for correlation with new cases and deaths. RESULTS: Reliability analysis revealed excellent reliability for COVID-19 search terms in all countries. Web-based interest peaked between 23 February and 5 April 2020, which was prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most included countries. There was a moderate to strong correlation between COVID-19 related queries and new cases or new deaths.

In 2018C2019, season 1, this ED implemented mandatory vaccine screening and offered the vaccine to all eligible patients; however, only 9% of the eligible population received the vaccine. In 2019C2020, season 2, the team sought to improve influenza vaccination rates from 9% to 15% and administer over 2,000 vaccines to eligible ED patients. METHODS: Key drivers included: identifying vaccine hesitancy, providing counseling, reducing administration delays, and developing reminders for vaccine administration. We tested interventions using plan-do-study-act cycles. We included discharged ED patients, age 6 monthsC18 years old, emergency severity index score 2C5, and no prior vaccine this season. Process measures included percent of patients screened, eligible, accepting the vaccine, and leaving before vaccination. Outcome measures were the percent of eligible patients vaccinated and the total number of vaccines administered. Vaccination time was the balancing measure. RESULTS: We included 57,804 children in this study. Comparing season 1 to 2, screening rates (84%) and eligibility rates (58%) were similar. Vaccine acceptance rates improved from 13% to 22%, the proportion of patients leaving before vaccination decreased from 32% to 17%, and vaccination rates improved from 9% to 20%. Total vaccines administered increased from 1,309 to 3,180, and vaccination time was 5 minutes faster in season 2.

Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic. However, all of them were rejected, as they were mere speculations about how the gut microbiota might affect virus infection and disease severity, without any data whatsoever. However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021).

Mitigating the enormous risk of COVID-19 to nursing home residents requires adequate data. The widely used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset contains 2 derived statistics: Total Resident Confirmed COVID-19 Cases per 1000 Residents and Total Resident COVID-19 Deaths per 1000 Residents. These metrics provide a misleading picture, as facilities report cumulative counts of cases and deaths over different time periods but use a point-in-time measure as proxy for number of residents (number of occupied beds in a week), resulting in inflated statistics. We propose an alternative statistic to better illustrate the burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths across nursing facilities. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the CMS Nursing Home Compare and COVID-19 Nursing Home Datasets, we examined facilities with star ratings and COVID-19 data passing quality assurance checks for each reporting period from May 31 to August 16, 2020 (n = 11,115). METHODS: We derived an alternative measure of the number of COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents using the net change in weekly census. For each measure, we compared predicted number of cases/deaths by overall star rating using negative binomial regression with constant dispersion, controlling for county-level cases per capita and nursing home characteristics. RESULTS: The average number of cases per 1000 estimated residents using our method is lower compared with the metric using occupied beds as proxy for number of residents (44.8 compared with 66.6). We find similar results when examining number of COVID-19 deaths per 1000 residents.

However, studies investigating the influence of the PP are currently lacking in these patients. This is the first study to investigate the influence of the PP on the oxygenation and decarboxylation in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A prospective bicentric study design was used, and in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, PP was indicated from a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (P(aO2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (F(IO2)) ratio of <200. Patients were left prone for 16 h each. Pressure levels, F(IO2), were adjusted to ensure a P(aO2) greater than 60 mmHg. Blood gas analyses were performed before (baseline 0.5 h), during (1/2/5.5/9.5/13 h), and after being in the PP (1 h), the circulatory/ventilation parameters were continuously monitored, and lung compliance (LC) was roughly calculated. Responders were defined compared to the baseline value (P(aO2)/F(IO2) ratio increase of 15%; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(aCO2)) decrease of 2%). Results: 13 patients were included and 36 PP sessions were conducted. Overall, P(aO2)/F(IO2) increased significantly in the PP (p < 0.001). Most P(aO2)/F(IO2) responders (29/36 PP sessions, 77%) were identified 9.5 h after turning prone (14% slow responders), while most P(aCO2) responders (15/36 PP sessions, 42%) were identified 13 h after turning prone. A subgroup of patients (interval intubation to PP 3 days) showed less P(aO2)/F(IO2) responders (16% vs. 77%). An increase in P(aCO2) and minute ventilation in the PP showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). LC (median before the PP = 38 mL/cm H(2)O; two patients with LC >80 mL/cm H(2)O) showed a significant positive correlation with the 28 day survival of patients (p = 0.01). Conclusion: The PP significantly improves oxygenation in COVID-19 ARDS patients. The data suggest that they also benefit most from an early PP. A decrease in minute ventilation may result in fewer P(aCO2) responders. LC may be a predictive outcome parameter in COVID-19 patients.

This review presents the current knowledge of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by MDROs in long-term care facilities (LTCF), thereby providing a useful reference to establish objectives for implementing successful antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). We searched in PubMed and Scopus for studies examining the prevalence of MDROs and/or risk factors for the acquisition of MDROs in LTCF. One hundred and thirty-four studies published from 1987 to 2020 were included. The prevalence of MDROs in LTCF varies between the different continents, where Asia reported the highest prevalence of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacterales (71.6%), carbapenem resistant (CR) Enterobacterales (6.9%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (25.6%) and North America the highest prevalence to MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.4%), MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (15.0%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) (4.0%), and Clostridioides difficile (26.1%). Furthermore, MDRO prevalence has experienced changes over time, with increases in MDR P. aeruginosa and extended spectrum ?-lactamase producing Enterobacterales observed starting in 2015 and decreases of CR Enterobacterales, MDR A. baumannii, VRE, MRSA and C. difficile.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. RESULTS: Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. CONCLUSIONS: During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities. Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage. Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.","output":"Clinical orthodontic management during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampantly spreading across the globe. We assessed the pathogenicity and immune response generated by BA.1.1 sub-lineage of SARS-CoV-2 [Omicron (R346K) variant] in 5 to 6-week old Syrian hamsters and compared the observations with that of Delta variant infection. METHODS: Virus shedding, organ viral load, lung disease and immune response generated in hamsters were sequentially assessed. FINDINGS: The disease characteristics of the Omicron (R346K) variant were found to be similar to that of the Delta variant infection in hamsters like viral replication in the respiratory tract and interstitial pneumonia. The Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters demonstrated lesser body weight reduction and viral RNA load in the throat swab and nasal wash samples in comparison to the Delta variant infection. The viral load in the lungs and nasal turbinate samples and the lung disease severity of the Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters were found comparable with that of the Delta variant infected hamsters. Neutralizing antibody response against Omicron (R346K) variant was detected from day 5 and the cross-neutralization titre of the sera against other variants showed severe reduction ie., 7 fold reduction against Alpha and no titers against B.1, Beta and Delta. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary data shows that Omicron (R346K) variant infection can produce moderate to severe lung disease similar to that of the Delta variant and the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to Omicron (R346K) variant infection shows poor neutralizing ability against other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants like Delta which necessitates caution as it may lead to increased cases of reinfection.

We show how political scripts about pandemic responses are shaped by, and align with, deeply-rooted social values and political cultures. Social processes of meaning-making help explain the evolution of increasingly partisan public health discourse regarding topics like masking and institutional trust. We highlight the lack of memorialization of deaths in America-that has not acquired the same polarized political meaning as other issues-to consider how and why certain issues gain political valence, and what opportunities certain acts of politicization provide in shifting public discourse.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of participants aged 18 years was conducted. VA was measured in all participants using the ETDRS chart, Near Chart and smartphone-based Eye Chart application, respectively. VA was converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) for statistical analysis. Eyes with ETDRS VA worse than 1.0 logMAR (20/200) were excluded. The main outcome measures were levels of agreement between VA measured using the Near Chart or Eye Chart application vs the ETDRS chart. RESULTS: A total of 295 eyes of 151 participants were included. One hundred participants (66.2%) were female and the mean age was 64.3  12.5 years. Educational level was high school or below for 49% of participants and at Bachelors degree or above for 51%. The median logMAR VAs of all eyes tested using the ETDRS chart, Near Chart and Eye Chart application were 0.1, 0.0 and 0.1, respectively.

Aim To study the laboratory parameters, histopathological features of sinus mucosal biopsies and exenterated orbits and clinical aspects of patients with ROCM. Materials and methods We retrospectively analysed nasal and sinus debridement biopsies and orbital exenteration specimen of 30 patients, along with their laboratory parameters, clinical history of predisposing conditions and medication history during COVID-19 infection. Results All patients were either in post COVID-19 recovery period or having ongoing COVID-19 infection. Most patients were diabetic with increased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Steroids and antibiotics were used in most patients. 30 sinonasal mucosal debridement from various sites along with 9 orbital exenterations and one frontal decompression craniectomy specimen were examined. Mucor was densely seen in necrotic tissue and presence of vessel and nerve invasion was documented. There were four mortality. Conclusion ROCM is a life-threatening disease.

We evaluated four commercial (CDC 2019-nCoV, Applied Biosystems 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 TF-SinglePlex, 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2 TF-MultiPlex, and EURORealTime SARS-CoV-2), one customized (Institute Pasteur), and one in-house RT-PCR protocols with 92 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 92 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Furthermore, we compared economical and practical characteristics of these protocols. We also developed a highly sensitive digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) method. Finally, we conducted a local environmental study for the presence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces in a quarantined household using RT- and ddPCR methods. We found very low limits of detection (1 or 2 viral copies/L), high sensitivities (93.6-97.8%) and specificities (98.7-100%) for the tested RT-PCR protocols. We further demonstrated the feasibility of downscaling two of the commercial protocols, which could optimize testing capacity. In the local environmental study, only one surface sample tested positive for viral RNA, but without detectable infectivity in vitro. Tested commercial and customized RT-PCR detection kits show very good and comparable sensitivity, and specificity, and the kits could be further optimized for use on SARS-CoV-2 viral samples derived from human and surface swabbed samples.","output":"A comparative study of real-time RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and its application to human derived and surface swabbed material"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigated the relation of probiotic activity of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and expression of microRNA to immune response and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans host model. First, we evaluated the survival rate of C. elegans due to LGG exposure and bacterial colonization in the intestine. Next, the expression of mRNA and miRNA was analyzed in C. elegans exposure to LGG for 24 h using microarray. After exposure to LGG to C. elegans, colonized LGG was observed in the intestines of C. elegans and induced to extend lifespan. Moreover, persistent LGG in the intestine significantly enhanced the resistance of C. elegans exposed to both pathogenic bacteria and prolonged the lifespan of C. elegans. Transcriptome analysis indicated that LGG affected the expression levels of genes related to the innate immune response and upregulated the abundance of genes in multiple pathways of C. elegans, including Wnt signaling, TGF-beta signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of antibacterial genes was increased by LGG. Moreover, as the expression of microRNA miR-34 and immune-related pathways increased by exposure to LGG, the lifespan of C. elegans increased. However, in the miR-34 mutant C. elegans, the lifespan by LGG did not increase, so it was determined that miR-34 indirectly affects immune-related pathways. There was no significant difference in the expression of PMK-1 for LGG exposure in miR-34 mutants, suggesting that miR-34 may regulate PMK-1. In conclusion, we suggest that exposure of LGG to C. elegans enhances lifespan and resistance to food-borne pathogen infection by stimulating miR-34 and indirectly promoting PMK-1 activity.","output":"Probiotic Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG Increased Longevity and Resistance Against Foodborne Pathogens in Caenorhabditis elegans by Regulating MicroRNA miR-34."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may predispose patients to venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and diffuse intravascular coagulation, despite standard thrombopropylaxis. Our retrospective study reports the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure(SRF) treated with intermediate to full-dose enoxaparin. . Methods: This retrospective case series analysed data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and severe respiratory failure (SRF) admitted to our Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) between February 27 and April 20, 2020 for non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation. All patients received at least intermediate-dose enoxaparin (40 mg twice daily). If PE was suspected or diagnosed, patients were treated with full-dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was used to detect PE in patients with elevated D-dimer levels (> 3000 ng/mL) and/or other clinical indicators, including sudden worsening of cardiopulmonary status. Results: Ninety-two patients (71 males, 21 females;mean age 58  11 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia and SRF (mean arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] of 143  45 mm Hg) were admitted to our RICU. Twenty-two patients underwent CTPA (24%), with PEs detected in 11 (12%). Mean PaO2/FiO2 and mean D-dimer levels did not significantly differ between patients with or without PE. Eleven patients (12%) died in the hospital, with a mean age of 70  11 years for deceased patients and 56  11 years for surviving patients ( p < 0.0001). Conclusions: PE was diagnosed in 12% of patients despite intermediate to full-dose enoxaparin treatment. However the incidence of PE in our patients was lower than that previously reported.

Methods: In this clinical trial, 90 healthcare providers from two referral hospitals of COVID-19 were divided into the hydroxychloroquine group (400 mg/week for eight weeks) and the routine-care group. Serum CRP levels and the frequency of T-helper (CD4+ cells) and T-cytotoxic (CD8+ cells) were assessed at the beginning and end of the study. The groups were compared in terms of White Blood cells (WBCs), polymorph nuclear cells (PMNs), lymphocytes (LYM), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelets (Plt.). Results: The results revealed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of WBC, PMN, LYM, Hb, Plt., CD4, and CD8. The mean difference of the CD4:CD8 ratio showed a significantly higher decrease (P=0.05) in hydroxychloroquine group than in the control group (0.18 vs. 0.02).

It is a common and emerging problem among healthcare workers. Medical students may be at increased risk of burnout given the rigorous nature of their training. However, there is a paucity of data on the burden of burnout among medical students in Africa. AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout, as assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory C Student Survey (MBI-SS) as well as factors associated with the development of burnout among students pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degrees at Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), Uganda. METHODS: A single-centre, cross-sectional, online survey was conducted among MBChB students of MUST. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory C Student Survey (MBI-SS) tool. Bivariate analysis and backward stepwise logistic regression analysis were performed to assess possible associations between variables related to participants demography, socioeconomic, personal, learning environment, outside school environment aspects and burnout prevalence scores. RESULTS: A total of 145 medical students, 102 (70.3%) male, with a median (range) age of 23 (18C40) years were studied. A total of 135 students (93.1%) presented with high levels of emotional exhaustion, 90 (62.1%) students had low levels of professional efficacy scores and 141 (97.2%) of the medical students had high levels of cynicism. Overall, 79 (54.5%) students had burnout, as defined by the MBI-SS tool. Choosing MBChB willingly appears to be an independent predictor of burnout (Adjusted odds ratio: 7.2; 95% CI: 1.4C36.9; p=0.018).

Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are:\\"in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?\\",\\"Are there repeated offenders?\\", and\\"How are new crowd management measures performing?\\". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way.

Previously, we genome-sequenced Rigvir? and five echovirus 7 isolates, and those sequences are further analyzed in this paper. A phylogenetic analysis of the full-length data suggested that Rigvir? was most distant from the other E7 isolates used in this study, placing Rigvir? in its own clade at the root of the phylogeny. Rigvir? contained nine unique mutations in the viral capsid proteins VP1-VP4 across the whole data set, with a structural analysis showing six of the mutations concerning residues with surface exposure on the cytoplasmic side of the viral capsid. One of these mutations, E/Q/N162G, was located in the region that forms the contact interface between decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and E7. Rigvir? and five other isolates were also subjected to cell infectivity assays performed on eight different cell lines. The used cell lines contained both cancer and non-cancer cell lines for observing Rigvir?'s claimed properties of being both oncolytic and oncotropic. Infectivity assays showed that Rigvir? had no discernable difference in the viruses' oncolytic effect when compared to the Wallace prototype or the four other E7 isolates. Rigvir? was also seen infecting non-cancer cell lines, bringing its claimed effect of being oncotropic into question. Thus, we conclude that Rigvir?'s claim of being an effective treatment against multiple different cancers is not warranted under the evidence presented here.

The drivers and barriers for under-vaccination also include logistics (access to and awareness of affordable vaccines) as well as a complex mix of psychological, social, political, and cultural factors. INCREASING VACCINE UPTAKE There is a need for effective strategies to increase vaccine uptake in various settings, based on the best available evidence. Fortunately, the field of vaccine acceptance research is growing rapidly with the development, implementation, and evaluation of diverse measurement tools, as well as interventions to address the challenging range of drivers and barriers for vaccine acceptance. ANNUAL VACCINE ACCEPTANCE MEETINGS Since 2011, the Mrieux Foundation has hosted annual vaccine acceptance meetings in Annecy, France that have fostered an informal community of practice on vaccination confidence and vaccine uptake. Mutual learning and sharing of knowledge has directly resulted in many initiatives and research projects. Here we report the discussions from the 7th Annual Vaccine Acceptance meeting on 23-25 September 2019. During this meeting, participants discussed emergent vaccine acceptance challenges and evidence-informed ways of addressing them in a programme that included sessions on vaccine mandates, vaccine acceptance and demand, training on vaccine acceptance, and frameworks for resilience of vaccination programmes.","output":"Increasing vaccine acceptance using evidence-based approaches and policies: Insights from research on behavioural and social determinants presented at the 7th Annual Vaccine Acceptance Meeting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we proposed an approach to analyze text classification methods based on the presence or absence of task-specific terms (and their synonyms) in the text.

A March 2020 NH survey indicated improvements in pandemic planning when compared to a similar survey in 2007. We surveyed NHs to evaluate how well pandemic preparedness plans and infection prevention strategies met the reality of COVID-19. METHODS: The first COVID-19 case in Michigan was reported March 10, 2020. In the setting of 46,088 cases and 4,327 deaths statewide as of May 1, we disseminated an online survey to state department-registered NHs to describe their experience of the initial pandemic wave. Responses were collected May 1C12, during which the state averaged 585 cases/day. We were particularly interested in NH preparedness, challenges, testing capacity, and adaptations made. RESULTS: Of 452 NHs contacted, 145 opened the survey and 143 (32%) responded. A majority (68%) indicated that their facilitys pandemic response plan addressed > 90% of issues they experienced; 29% reported their plan addressed most but not all anticipated concerns (Table 1). As the pandemic evolved, all facilities (100%) provided additional staff education on proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use. 66% reported experiencing shortages of PPE and other supplies. Half of all facilities (50%) lacked sufficient resources to test asymptomatic residents or staff; only 36% were able to test all residents and staff with suspected COVID-19 infection. Half (52%) considered their communication regarding COVID-19 with nearby hospitals very good. The majority of facilities (55%) experienced staffing shortages, often relying on remaining staff to work additional hours and/or contracted staff to fill deficits (Table 2). NH staff resignations increased, with 63% of NHs experiencing resignations; staff with greater bedside contact were more likely to leave, including nurses and nurse assistants. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: While most NHs had a plan to respond to COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, many facilities experienced a lack of available resources, less than ideal communication lines with local hospitals, lack of testing capacity and insufficient staff.

With a better understanding of these mechanisms, management and research can be tailored specifically for each disease stage. Pre-disease and early disease stages call for management strategies that may decrease the risk of long-term morbidity, by focusing on avoidance of further insults, adequate rest to enable recovery, and pacing of activities. Later disease stages require a more holistic and tailored management approach, with treatmentas this becomes availabletargeting the alleviation of symptoms and multi-systemic dysfunction. More stringent and standardised use of case definitions in research is critical to improve generalisability of results and to create the strong evidence-based policies for management that are currently lacking in ME/CFS.","output":"A Natural History of Disease Framework for Improving the Prevention, Management, and Research on Post-viral Fatigue Syndrome and Other Forms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Being the major lymphoid organ of human body, spleen performs critical immunological functions such as bacteria depuration from bloodstream and precocious antibody production against various antigenic particles. Spleen, liver and lung accounts for more than 95% of phagocytic activity in humans. METHODS: We used intravenous inoculation of Escherichia coli AB1157 in Wistar rats in order to evaluate this function. Young and adult rats of both sexes were submitted to total splenectomy and compared to animals not submitted to any surgical procedure. Sixteen weeks later, rats of both groups were challenged with a suspension of E. coli labeled with Tc-99m, and, after twenty minutes, they were killed. Liver, lung, spleen and a blood clot sample were removed for radioactivity determination. The statistical study was performed with Student's t test. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the radioactivity uptake obtained from young and adult splenectomized rats. However, these rats were associated with higher levels of blood counts than animals of the control group (p 0.0001) due to a larger bacteria remnant in the bloodstream.

Due to various symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, there is a pressing need for a fast and sensitive detection protocol to diagnose asymptomatic people. Various SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits are already available from many companies and national health agencies. However, publicly available information on these diagnostic kits is lacking. In response to the growing need and the lack of information, we developed and made available a low-cost, easy-access, real-time PCR-based protocol for the early detection of the virus in a previous study. During the development of the detection protocol, we found that unoptimized primer sets could inadvertently show false-positive results, raising the possibility that commercially available diagnostic kits might also contain primer sets that produce false-positive results. Here, we provide three-step guidelines for the design and optimization of specific primer sets. The three steps include (1) the selection of primer sets for target genes (RdRP, N, E, and S) in the genome of interest (SARS-CoV-2), (2) the in silico validation of primer and amplicon sequences, and (3) the optimization of PCR conditions (i.e., primer concentrations and annealing temperatures) for specific hybridization between the primers and target genes, and the elimination of spurious primer dimers. Furthermore, we have expanded the previously developed real-time PCR-based protocol to more conventional PCR-based protocols and applied a multiplex PCR-based protocol that allows the simultaneous testing of primer sets for RdRP, N, E, and S all in one reaction. Our newly optimized protocol should be helpful for the large-scale, high-fidelity screening of asymptomatic people, even without any high-specification equipment, for the further prevention of transmission, and to achieve early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","output":"Optimization of primer sets and detection protocols for SARS-CoV-2 of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using PCR and real-time PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic the organization of maternity care changed drastically; this study into the experiences of maternity care professionals with these changes provides suggestions for the organization of care during and after pandemics. DESIGN: An online survey among Dutch midwives, obstetricians and obstetric residents. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between the respondents characteristics and answers. RESULTS: Reported advantages of the changes were fewer prenatal and postpartum consultations (50.1%). The necessity and safety of medical interventions and ultrasounds were considered more critically (75.9%); 14.8% of community midwives stated they referred fewer women to the hospital for decreased fetal movements, whereas 64.2% of the respondents working in hospital-based care experienced fewer consultations for this indication. Respondents felt that women had more confidence in giving birth at home (57.5%). Homebirths seemed to have increased according to 38.5% of the community midwives and 65.3% of the respondents working in hospital-based care. Respondents appreciated the shift to more digital consultations rather than face-to-face consultations. Mentioned disadvantages were that women had appointments alone, (71.1%) and that the community midwife was not allowed to join a woman to obstetric-led care during labour and subsequently stay with her (56.8%). Fewer postpartum visits by family and friends led to more tranquility (59.8%). Overall, however, 48.0% of the respondents felt that the safety of maternity care was compromised due to policy changes. CONCLUSIONS: Maternity care professionals were positive about the decrease in routine care and the increased confidence of women in home birth, but also felt that safety in maternity care was sometimes compromised.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 240 cases with a mean age of 47.6  15.9 years, ranging from 20 to 90 years, who had a chest CT and RT-PCR performed. Computed tomography images were independently analyzed by 2 thoracic radiologists to identify patterns defined by the RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement, and concordance was determined with weighted  tests. Also, CT findings and CT severity scores were tabulated and compared. RESULTS Of the 240 cases, 118 had findings on CT. The most frequent on the RT-PCR-positive group were areas of ground-glass opacities (80.5%), crazy-paving pattern (32.2%), and rounded pseudonodular ground-glass opacities (22.9%). Regarding the CT patterns, the most frequent in the RT-PCR-positive group was typical in 75.9%, followed by negative in 17.1%.

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and evaluate the risk factors for severe COVID-19 in Jeju island, Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted between February 20, 2020, and June 19, 2021, at a single center were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The severity of illness was defined using five categories (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical) according to the National Institute of Health criteria. Then, patients with severe and critical illness were grouped into a severe group, whereas patients with asymptomatic, mild, and moderate illness were grouped into a non-severe group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with the severe group. RESULTS: This study included 348 patients with a median age was 57 years, and 37.5% were aged 60 or older. Among them, 43.4% were male and 10.9% were asymptomatic, whereas 41.4%, 33.9%, 12.9%, and 1.1% had mild, moderate, severe, and critical illness. The all-cause mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 0.28% (1/348). Among confirmed patients with COVID-19, exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was mainly within Jeju island (75.9%). The mean body mass index was 24.09  4.04 kg/m(2), the median comorbidity index score was low in each group (0 in asymptomatic; 1 in mild; 1 in moderate; 1 in severe; and 2 in critical group, P <0.548). In the multivariable analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR), 6.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.69 C 15.13; P <0.001], 65 years of age (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.18 C 6.10; P <0.019), chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 6.10; 95% CI, 1.40 C 26.61; P = 0.016), and length of fever duration (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19 C 1.49; P <0.001) were independently associated with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The most relevant risk factors of COVID-19 severity were male sex, older age, underlying chronic lung diseases, and duration of fever during hospitalization. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were not significantly different from those reported in other studies. However, a lower proportion of the older population among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases might contribute to the lower fatality rate than the national rate.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Severe Disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Low Case Fatality Rate Region in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Current literature lacks good-quality evidence regarding the outcomes of early pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for acute exogenous endophthalmitis. The aim for this study was to analyze and discuss the outcomes of PPV for endophthalmitis in a UK tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective case series. The clinical records of consecutive patients who had PPV for acute exogenous endophthalmitis were reviewed. Demographic data, etiology, timing of onset, timing of PPV, intraand postoperative complications, baseline and final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), therapeutic regimens, and microbiology details were collected. Primary efficacy and safety outcome measures were BCVA improvement of two or more logMAR lines and intra- or postoperative complications, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-one patients with a median age of 76 (interquartile range, 64 to 82) years were studied. The most common etiology was intravitreal injection (41%), followed by phacoemulsification (34%). Median interval to PPV was 1.0 (interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0) days. In a multivariate model controlling for age, baseline BCVA, microbiology positivity, and etiology (post-intravitreal injection), PPV after 24 hours was seven times more likely to achieve significant BCVA improvement (odds ratio, 7.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 49.66; P = .038). PPV within 24 hours of presentation was associated with more intraoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes may be achieved with current antibiotic regimens and PPV for endophthalmitis. The series suggests that an early surgical intervention may be associated with poorer functional outcomes. Tap and inject at presentation, followed by a semi-urgent PPV as required, seems to be a sensible approach.

This systematic review aims to report the characteristics of stroke in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Three authors independently searched Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PubMed starting from inception up to May 22, 2020. The data for individual patients was extracted where available from published reports including clinical and laboratory parameters and analysed for any significant associations between variables. RESULTS: We identified 30 relevant articles involving 115 patients with acute or subacute stroke with COVID-19. The meanstandard deviation age was 62.514.5 years. Stroke was ischemic in majority of the patients (101 [87.8%]). Hypertension (42 [42%]), dyslipidaemia (24 [26.1%]), and diabetes (23 [23.2%]) were the major vascular risk factors. Most of the patients (80 [85.1%]) had COVID-19 symptoms at the time of stroke with a median interval of 10 days to stroke from the diagnosis of COVID-19. Three-fourths (86 [74.8%]) of the patients were critically ill which frequently delayed the diagnosis of stroke. High levels of D-dimer, and ferritin were observed in these patients. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had a high mortality (47.9%). Factors associated with mortality were intensive care unit admission, having two or more vascular risk factors, particularly smoking and high levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: The association between stroke and COVID-19 is probably multifactorial including an amalgamation of traditional vascular risk factors, proinflammatory and a prothrombotic state.

Immune dysfunction is similarly described in hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). We present here the case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicated by suspected haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). He was found to have HH post-mortem and we propose a link between his iron overload and the development of severe COVID-19. Case Report The initial clinical presentation consisted of cough, shortness of breath and fever. Pancytopenia, markedly elevated ferritin and d-dimer were present. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral ground glass changes consistent with COVID-19, widespread lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A subsequent combined nose and throat swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). HLH was suspected based upon the H-score and Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, was commenced. Liver function acutely worsened and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed hepatic haemosiderosis. Intense splenic and cervical lymph node uptake were seen on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and high doses of intravenous steroids were administered due to concerns over haematological malignancy. Results Day fourteen of admission heralded the start of progressive clinical deterioration with rapid increase in oxygen demands. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was trialled without success and the patient unfortunately died seventeen days into admission. Results returned after his death showed homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene consistent with a diagnosis of HH. Post-mortem examination revealed widespread haemosiderin deposition in the liver along with lung pathology in keeping with severe COVID-19 and widespread splenic infarctions. Conclusion An association between HH and COVID-19 is not currently described in the literature. What does exist, however, is an evidence base for the detrimental impacts iron overload has on viral infections in general and the negative effects of HH on the immune system. We therefore postulate that the underlying metabolic and immune disturbances seen in HH should be considered a potential risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19. This case also adds to the evidence that hyperinflammation appears to be a unique and interesting characteristic of this novel viral disease.","output":"Hereditary haemochromatosis, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Market implementation of active and intelligent packaging (AIP) technologies specifically for fiber-based food packaging can be hindered by various factors.

The continually emerging new variants of concern raise the question as to whether the existing vaccines will continue to provide sufficient protection for individuals from SARS-CoV-2 during natural infection. This narrative review aims to briefly outline various immunotherapeutic options and discuss the potential of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR Cas system technology against COVID-19 treatment as specific cure. As the development of vaccine, convalescent plasma, neutralizing antibodies are based on the understanding of human immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, boosting human body immune responses in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunotherapeutics seem feasible as specific cure against COVID-19 if the present challenges are overcome. In cell based therapeutics, apart from the high costs, risks and side effects, there are technical problems such as the production of sufficient potent immune cells and antibodies under limited time to treat the COVID-19 patients in mild conditions prior to progression into a more severe case. The CRISPR Cas technology could be utilized to refine the specificity and safety of CAR-T cells, CAR-NK cells and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during various stages of the COVID-19 disease progression in infected individuals. Moreover, CRISPR Cas technology are proposed in hypotheses to degrade the viral RNA in order to terminate the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

A pragmatic trial was conducted at six United States hospitals. We enrolled COVID-19 patients that were admitted between 10 March and 4 June 2020. Treatment was not randomized. The study endpoint was mortality; discharge was a competing event. Hazard ratios were obtained on the entire population, and on the subpopulation indicated by the algorithm as suitable for treatment.

We draw on Kingdon's definition of the agenda and Hilgartner and Bosk's public arenas model to conceptualize the global health agenda as those subjects or problems to which collectivities of actors operating nationally and globally are paying serious attention at any given time. We propose an arenas model for global health agenda setting and illustrate its potential utility by assessing priority indicators in five arenas, including international aid, pharmaceutical industry, scientific research, news media and civil society. We then apply the model to illustrate how the status of established (HIV/AIDS), emergent (diabetes) and rising (Alzheimer's disease) issues might be measured, compared and change in light of a pandemic shock (COVID-19). RESULTS: Coronavirus priority indicators rose precipitously in all five arenas in 2020, reflecting the kind of punctuation often caused by focusing events. The magnitude of change varied somewhat by arena, with the most pronounced shift in the global news media arena. Priority indicators for the other issues showed decreases of up to 21% and increases of up to 41% between 2019 and 2020, with increases suggesting that the agenda for global health issues expanded in some arenas in 2020- COVID-19 did not consistently displace priority for HIV/AIDS, diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, though it might have for other issues. CONCLUSIONS: We advance an arenas model as a novel means of addressing conceptual and measurement challenges that often undermine the validity of claims concerning the global health agenda status of problems and contributing causal factors. Our presentation of the model and illustrative analysis lays the groundwork for more systematic investigation of trends in global health agenda setting. Further specification of the model is needed to ensure accurate representation of vital national and transnational arenas and their interactions, applicability to a range of disease-specific, health systems, governance and policy issues, and sensitivity to subtler influences on global health agenda setting than pandemic shocks.","output":"The rise and fall of global health issues: an arenas model applied to the COVID-19 pandemic shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Rheumatic diseases patients receiving Rituximab had severe COVID-19 disease.

Therefore, we evaluated metabolites and their potential cardiovascular effects in metabolic-dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 75 participants (38 MAFLD and 37 controls). Hepatic steatosis was confirmed by hepatic ultrasonography and SteatoTest(TM). Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. Metabolomic analysis was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry. RESULTS: The median age for participants age was 45 (IQR 30C56.5), with gender distribution of 35 males and 40 females. MAFLD patients had lower levels of glycyl tyrosine (p-value < 0.001), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (18:2/0:0) (p-value < 0.001), LPC (22:6) (p-value < 0.001), and ceramide (Cer) (d18:0/23:0) (p-value 0.003) compared to controls. MAFLD patients presented lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), E/A ratio, E/e ratio, and average global longitudinal strain (GLS) values, with a p-value of 0.047, <0.001, 0.008, and <0.001, respectively. Decreased glycyl tyrosine levels were significantly correlated with reduced LVEF, even after performing multiple linear regression with 95% CI (1.34C3.394, p-value < 0.001). Moreover, decreased LPC (18:2/0:0) levels remained significantly associated with E/A ratio, even after adjusting for confounding factors with 95% CI (0.008C0.258, p-value = 0.042). CONCLUSION: MAFLD patients are at risk for developing cardiac systolic and subclinical systolic dysfunctions, as well as diastolic dysfunction. Decreased glycyl tyrosine levels correlate with reduced LVEF and LPC (18:2/0:0) levels with diastolic dysfunction, even after adjusting for confounding factors, suggesting their potential to be used as metabolic biomarkers in detecting cardiovascular risk.","output":"Metabolic biomarkers related to cardiac dysfunction in metabolic-dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: a cross-sectional analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The present meta-analysis of clinical and simulation trials aimed to compare video-instructed dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (V-DACPR) with conventional audio-instructed dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (C-DACPR). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Collaboration databases and Scopus from inception until June 10, 2021. The primary outcomes were the prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and survival to hospital discharge with a good neurological outcome for clinical trials, and chest compression quality for simulation trials. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) indicated the pooled effect. The analyses were performed with the RevMan 5.4 and STATA 14 software. RESULTS: Overall, 2 clinical and 8 simulation trials were included in this meta-analysis. In clinical trials, C-DACPR and V-DACPR were characterised by, respectively, 11.8% vs. 24.3% of prehospital ROSC (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.69; I(2) = 66%; p < .001), 10.7% vs. 22.3% of survival to hospital discharge (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.70; I(2) = 69%; p < .001), and 6.3% vs. 16.0% of survival to hospital discharge with a good neurological outcome (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.67; I(2) = 73%; p < .001). In simulation trials, chest compression rate per minute equalled 91.3  22.6 for C-DACPR and 107.8  12.6 for V-DACPR (MD = ?13.40; 95% CI: ?21.86, ?4.95; I(2) = 97%; p = .002).

OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, 17 M, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was 12 M and 7 M, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC(50) (5.3 M and 11.6 M, respectively), higher than the EC(50) of remdesivir (1.0  0.1 M), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC(50) of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination.

The primary efficacy endpoint for Phase 2b is proportional change in D-dimer concentration from baseline to Day 8 or day of discharge, whichever is earlier. The primary safety endpoint is major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding through Day 8. Phase 2b enrollment began in December 2020 and is projected to complete 160 participants by Q4 2021. CONCLUSIONS: ASPEN-COVID-19 will provide important data on a novel therapeutic approach that may improve outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients beyond available anticoagulants by targeting tissue factor, with potential effects on not only thrombosis but also inflammation and viral propagation.","output":"Rationale and design of a study to assess the safety and efficacy of rNAPc2 in COVID-19: the Phase 2b ASPEN-COVID-19 trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We found a strong correlation between travel volumes departing from Wuhan, Hubei Province before the Spring Festival and the extent of amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in 2020, with 100 top cities.

BACKGROUND The goal of LLR is to extend the benefits of the laparoscopic approach without compromising the fundamental principles of open liver surgery. LLR, however, presents unique technical challenges and its evaluation is made difficult by the restricted indications for this approach, the few centers world-wide experienced in the technique, and the heterogeneity of procedures and pathologies involved. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of liver resections from a unit with a comprehensive liver program, including resection and transplantation. RESULTS There were 166 laparoscopic liver resections between May 23, 1996 and December 31, 2007, including 100 (60%) for malignant pathology (64 HCC, 3 cholangiocarcinoma, 33 hepatic metastases) and 66 for benign pathology (adenoma, 23; FNH, 19; cystic, 17; other, 7). Numbers of resections for benign indications remained stable over time whereas those for malignant indications increased. There were 31 major resections, 56 left lateral sectionectomies, 28 segmentectomies, and 51 tumorectomies. There was 0% mortality and 15.1% morbidity. Median blood loss was 200 mL, 9 patients (5.4%) required transfusion, and median operating time was 180 minutes. Left lateral sectionectomies demonstrated reduced bleeding (median, 175 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0015) and faster operating time (median, 170 vs. 180 minutes, P = 0.0265). In the second half of the experience, there was reduced bleeding (median, 200 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0022) and a lower conversion rate (2.4% vs. 16.9%, P = 0.0015). CONCLUSIONS Good patient selection and refined surgical technique are the keys to successful LLR. The indications for resection of asymptomatic benign lesions should not be increased because the laparoscopic approach is available. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are more likely to be suitable to a laparoscopic approach than colorectal liver metastases. Left lateral sectionectomy and limited resection of solitary peripheral lesions are particularly suitable while hemihepatectomies remain challenging procedures. LLR requires an ongoing robust audit to identify any emerging problems.","output":"Laparoscopic liver resection-understanding its role in current practice: the Henri Mondor Hospital experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial cleaning takes advantage of naturally-occurring microbes to remove a wide variety of contaminants from various surfaces.

Therefore, COVID-19-ARDS survivors requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were followed six months after discharge. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 6-min walk test (6MWT) and echocardiography were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. Patients were compared based on respiratory mechanics and CT-phenotype during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Eighteen patients were included (61  7 years; ICU-stay: 34  16 days; IMV: 30  15 days). At follow-up (197  15 days after discharge), PFTs did not reveal significant limitations (VC: 92  16%; FEV1: 92  20%; DLco/VA: 81  16%). Cardiac systolic function was normal in all patients, but 50% of them had diastolic dysfunction. 6MWT was under the lower limit of normal in only two patients. Eight patients (44%) reported tiredness, six (33%) suffered from fatigue and one patient (6%) had depression and anxiety.

Among different therapeutic approaches (eg, medication and psychotherapy), psychotherapy in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard treatment for MDD. However, although efficacious, CBT is not readily accessible to many patients in need because of hurdles such as stigma, long wait times, high cost, the large time commitment for health care providers, and cultural or geographic barriers. Electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT) can effectively address many of these accessibility barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing an e-CBT program compared with in-person treatment for MDD. It is hypothesized that the e-CBT program will offer results comparable with those of the in-person treatment program, regarding symptom reduction and quality of life improvement. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will provide e-CBT for MDD through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants (aged 18-65 years) will be offered 12 weekly sessions of an e-CBT program tailored to MDD to address their depressive symptoms. Participants (n=55) will complete predesigned modules and homework assignments while receiving personalized feedback and interacting with a therapist through the platform. Using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be compared with that of a group (n=55) receiving in-person CBT. Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at week 6 and week 12, and at a 6-month follow-up. Focus groups will be conducted to investigate personal, cultural, and social factors impacting the accessibility and feasibility of implementing a web-based psychotherapy tool from a patient and care provider perspective. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of MDD, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: Ethics approval was obtained in January 2019, and recruitment of participants began in June 2019. Recruitment has been conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 52 participants have been recruited to the e-CBT group, and 48 patients have been recruited to the in-person CBT group. Data collection is expected to be completed by March 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by June 2021, as linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) are still being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can provide valuable information for the development of more accessible and scalable mental health interventions with increased care capacity for MDD, without sacrificing the quality of care.

This cap moiety ((7m)GpppN) is an essential RNA structural modification allowing its efficient translation, limiting its degradation by cellular 5' exonucleases and avoiding its recognition as \\"nonself\\" by the innate immunity machinery. In vitro synthesis of capped RNA is an important bottleneck for many biological studies. Moreover, the lack of methods allowing the synthesis of large amounts of RNA starting with a specific 5'-end sequence have hampered biological and structural studies of proteins recognizing the cap structure or involved in the capping pathway. Due to the chemical nature of N(7)-methylguanosine, the synthesis of RNAs possessing a cap structure at the 5' end is still a significant challenge. In the present work, we combined a chemical synthesis method and an enzymatic methylation assay in order to produce large amounts of RNA oligonucleotides carrying a cap-0 or cap-1. Short RNAs were synthesized on solid support by the phosphoramidite 2'-O-pivaloyloxymethyl chemistry. The cap structure was then coupled by the addition of GDP after phosphorylation of the terminal 5'-OH and activation by imidazole. After deprotection and release from the support, GpppN-RNAs or GpppN(2'-Om)-RNAs were purified before the N(7)-methyl group was added by enzymatic means using the human (guanine-N(7))-methyl transferase to yield (7m)GpppN-RNAs (cap-0) or (7m)GpppN(2'-Om)-RNAs (cap-1). The RNAs carrying different cap structures (cap, cap-0 or, cap-1) act as bona fide substrates mimicking cellular capped RNAs and can be used for biochemical and structural studies.","output":"Synthesis of 5' cap-0 and cap-1 RNAs using solid-phase chemistry coupled with enzymatic methylation by human (guanine-N?)-methyl transferase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic multisystem disorder.

TRAM34-sensitive KCa3.1-channels, encoded by the KCNN4 gene, are exclusively expressed in therapeutically bioactive EDC subfractions and maintain a strongly polarized resting potential; whereas therapeutically inert EDCs lack KCa3.1 channels and exhibit depolarized resting potentials. Somatic gene transfer of KCNN4 results in membrane hyperpolarization and increases intracellular [Ca2+], which boosts cell-proliferation and the production of pro-healing cytokines/nanoparticles. Intramyocardial injection of EDCs after KCNN4-gene overexpression markedly increases the salutary effects of EDCs on cardiac function, viable myocardium and peri-infarct neovascularization in a well-established murine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Therefore, this case study sought to investigate the changes that have taken place in recent cockle fishing decades and verify the degree of contentment of these fishers with the rules for cockle fishing during the current pandemic period. LEK showed a downward trend in cockle stock on a time scale of around 60 years. Members of these fishing villages have not experienced the shifting baseline syndrome.

Fishers were not content with the measures and circumstances imposed on cockle fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2021. The main points related to the discontent were about income and government financial support to fishers. Synergistic initiatives covering all those involved with the cockle bioresource are essential for the sustainability of this resource of great socio-ecological importance for the Iberian Peninsula.

It is frequently assumed that digital technologies can supplement and perhaps even replace services for families. This is challenging in conditions of high device and data costs as well as poor internet provision and access, raising concerns about widening inequalities in availability of support and consequent effects on child and family outcomes. Very few studies have examined these issues, including in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were two-fold. The first objective was to gather data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families of young children using an online survey. The second objective was to assess the feasibility of using a data-free online platform to conduct regular surveys and, potentially, to provide support for parents and families of young children in South Africa. METHODS: We used a data-free mobile messenger platform to conduct a short digital survey of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caring for young children in South Africa. We report on the methodological processes and preliminary findings of the online survey. RESULTS: More than 44,000 individuals accessed the survey link and 16,217 consented to the short survey within 96 hours of its launch. Respondents were predominantly from lower classes and lower-middle classes, representing the majority of the population, with urban residential locations roughly proportionate to national patterns and some underrepresentation of rural households. Mothers comprised 70.2% (11,178/15,912) of respondents and fathers comprised 29.8% (4734/15,912), representing 18,672 children 5 years of age and younger. Response rates per survey item ranged from 74.8% (11,907/15,912) at the start of the survey to 50.3% (8007/15,912) at completion. A total of 82.0% (12,729/15,912) of parents experienced at least one challenge during the pandemic, and 32.4% (2737/8441) did not receive help when needed from listed sources. Aggregate and individual findings in the form of bar graphs were made available to participants to view and download once they had completed the survey. Participants were also able to download contact details for support and referral services at no data cost. CONCLUSIONS: Data-free survey methodology breaks new ground and demonstrates potential not previously considered. Reach is greater than achieved through phone surveys and some social media platforms, men are not usually included in parent surveys, costs are lower than phone surveys, and the technology allows for immediate feedback to respondents. These factors suggest that zero-rated, or no-cost, services could provide a feasible, sustainable, and equitable basis for ongoing interactions with families of young children.","output":"A Data-Free Digital Platform to Reach Families With Young Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p7 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) functions as an ion channel in planar lipid bilayers, and its function is vital for the virus life cycle.

METHODS: We searched articles addressing the impact of modifiable lifestyle factors on the incidence and/or progression of CKD, published between 2011 and 2020, from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database. An adjusted citation index, which considered both the original citation count and publication year, was derived for the selection of most-cited publications. Publishing trends, co-authorship network, keywords, and research hotspots were analyzed and visualized. RESULTS: Among the top 100 most influential articles, 32 were narrative reviews, 16 systematic reviews and/or meta-analysis, 44 clinical research, and 8 basic research. The United States occupied a dominant position in the perspective of article numbers and international partnerships, followed by European countries. The modifiable factors that drew the most and constant attention over the decade were diet or nutrition management reported in 63 papers, followed by obesity or body mass index (n = 27), and physical activity or exercises (n = 8).

Such techniques have recently been applied to characterize and monitor SARS-CoV-2 , the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the isolation and culture of SARS-CoV-2 is time consuming and requires biosafety level 3 containment, which is not ideal for many resource-constrained settings. An alternate method, bait capture allows target enrichment and sequencing of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome eliminating the need for viral culture. This method uses a set of hybridization probes known as \\"baits\\" that span the genome and provide sensitive, accurate, and minimal off-target hybridization. Baits can be designed to detect any known virus or bacteria in a wide variety of specimen types, including oral secretions. The bait capture method presented herein allows the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva to be sequenced without the need to culture and provides an outline of bait design and bioinformatic analysis to guide a bioinformatician.","output":"Whole-Genome Sequencing of Pathogens in Saliva : A Target-Enrichment Approach for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This paper describes the radiological and clinical findings identified in a group of patients with H1N1 influenza. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and mid-November 2009, 3,649 patients with suspected H1N1 influenza presented to our hospital. Our study population comprised 167 (91 male, 76 female patients, age range 11 months to 82 years; mean age 29 years) out of 1,896 patients with throat swab positive for H1N1 and clinical and laboratory findings indicative of viral influenza. All 167 patients were studied by chest X-ray (CXR), and 20 patients with positive CXR and worsening clinical condition also underwent computed tomography (CT). The following findings were evaluated on both modalities: interstitial reticulation (IR), nodules (N), ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations (CONS), bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Ninety of 167 patients had positive CXR results. Abnormalities identified on CXR, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 53 IR, 5 N, 13 GGO, 50 CONS; the predominant combination was represented by six GGO with CONS. Of the 20 CXR-positive cases also studied by CT, 17 showed pathological findings. The abnormalities identified on CT, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 14 IR, 2 N, 5 GGO; the predominant combination was 10 GGO with CONS. Despite the differences between the two modalities, the principle radiological findings of bacterial superinfection were tree-in-bud pattern, consolidation with air bronchogram, and pleural and pericardial effusion. Fifteen of the 20 patients studied by both CXR and chest CT showed respiratory complications with bilateral and diffuse CONS on CXR and CT. Six of 15 died: 4/6 of acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2/6 of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the radiological and clinical characteristics of a large population of patients affected by H1N1 influenza. CXR and chest CT identified the site and extent of the pulmonary lesions and documented signs of bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications.","output":"Influenza A virus: radiological and clinical findings of patients hospitalised for pandemic H1N1 influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the question of trust in news and information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus of the article is on trust in radio news and the data are collected in Sweden during spring 2020. Two questions are asked: (1) to what extent do people in Sweden express trust in the radio as a medium, and radio news and information as a form of content? (2) How do people themselves explain and discuss their trust in the radio as a medium and in radio news and information? The article draws on both survey data and qualitative interviews in answering these questions. The results show that radio, together with television, is the most trusted medium in the population but that there are differences in the extent of trust within the population that are related to age, economic status and political affiliation. The qualitative interviews showed that the specificities of how radio is organized and the form and mode of expression of radio news can help explain the high trust in the radio medium during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The voices we trust: Public trust in news and information about COVID-19 on Swedish Radio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and spread across the globe. The objective of this study is to build and validate a practical nomogram for estimating the risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort of 366 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was used to develop a prediction model using data collected from 47 locations in Sichuan province from January 2020 to February 2020. The primary outcome was the development of severe COVID-19 during hospitalization. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to reduce data size and select relevant features. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a prediction model incorporating the selected features. The performance of the nomogram regarding the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness was assessed. Internal validation was assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 43 years. Severe patients were older than mild patients by a median of 6 years. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were more common in severe patients. The individualized prediction nomogram included seven predictors: body temperature at admission, cough, dyspnea, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease. The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.862, C-index of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.925), and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.839 was reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on admission. This model can be used to help predict severe COVID-19 and identify patients at risk of developing severe disease.","output":"Development and validation a nomogram for predicting the risk of severe COVID-19: A multi-center study in Sichuan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, social media data collected in real time has the potential of being an early indicator of a new epidemic wave.

Once trained, the neural ODE is able to capture the dynamics of the interlinked local signals and accurately predict the number of new infections up to two months in advance. Moreover, it can estimate the future effects of changes in the number of infected at a given time, which can be associated with the flow of people entering or leaving a given region or, for instance, with a local vaccination campaign.

Thus, it is very important to effectively predict which patients with mild disease are more likely to progress to severe disease. A total of 72 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Shandong Provincial Public Health Clinical Center and 1141 patients included in the published papers were enrolled in this study. We determined that the combination of interleukin-6 (IL-6), Neutrophil (NEUT), and Natural Killer (NK) cells had the highest prediction accuracy (with 75% sensitivity and 95% specificity) for progression of COVID-19 infection. A binomial regression equation that accounted for a multiple risk score for the combination of IL-6, NEUT, and NK was also established.

This paper presents a mechanism to detect COVID-19 health-related misinformation in social media following an interdisciplinary approach. Leveraging social psychology as a foundation and existing misinformation frameworks, we defined misinformation themes and associated keywords incorporated into the misinformation detection mechanism using applied machine learning techniques. Next, using the Twitter dataset, we explored the performance of the proposed methodology using multiple state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Our method shows promising results with at most 78% accuracy in classifying health-related misinformation versus true information using uni-gram-based NLP feature generations from tweets and the Decision Tree classifier.

Participants took part in a phone interview and were asked about their sinonasal symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown, by answering the sinonasal outcome test (I-SNOT-22) questionnaire. Further data concerning the medications used to treat allergy and the number of days per month in which they were used were collected. The responses about the COVID-19 lockdown were compared to those obtained by the same patients in our clinics the previous year. The statistical analysis was executed by using the paired sample t-test and the Bartlett test considering as significant values with p values <0.05.

Background: With the pandemic having an impact on virtually all spheres of people's lives, some evidence already exists that it will lead to fertility postponement, as people are reluctant to make their reproductive choices in such uncertain times. Method: We analyse a nationally representative sample of 1000 respondents aged 18-49.

We perform logistic regression analyses to verify which perceived consequences of the pandemic are most decisive for this choice. We supplement our analyses with insights from qualitative, open-ended question on the effects of the pandemic. Results: We find that people's decision to postpone childbearing is related to respondents' perceived lower sense of financial security and worse mental well-being in the pandemic. In the model, where both factors are included, only mental well-being remains significant. Qualitative analyses point to several other factors important to fertility decisions in the pandemic, e.g., women's fear of lonely childbirth.

However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to be effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where unlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall models accuracy. However, in real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different distribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled from a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This results in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled datasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch between the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model trained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong distribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30%, suggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in the behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to diminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a density approximation of the feature space. It is built upon the target dataset to filter out the observations in the source unlabelled dataset that might harm the accuracy of the semi-supervised model. It assumes that a small labelled source dataset is available together with a larger source unlabelled dataset. Our proposed method does not require any model training, it is simple and computationally cheap. We compare our proposed method against two popular state of the art out-of-distribution data detectors, which are also cheap and simple to implement. In our tests, our method yielded accuracy gains of up to 32%, when compared to the previous state of the art methods. The good results yielded by our method leads us to argue in favour for a more data-centric approach to improve models accuracy. Furthermore, the developed method can be used to measure data effectiveness for semi-supervised deep learning model training.","output":"Dealing with distribution mismatch in semi-supervised deep learning for COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images: A novel approach using feature densities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventing food wastage is a key element of sustainable resource management. But as food waste is still generated at high volumes, priority is placed on its proper management as a resource, maximising sustainability benefits. This study, by integrating a multi-criteria decision analysis with a sustainability assessment approach, develops a screening and decision support framework for comparing the sustainability performance of food waste management options. A structured process for selecting criteria based on the consideration of environmental, economic and social aspects related to region-specific food waste system planning, policy and management has been developed. Two food waste management options, namely the use of food waste disposal units, which grind food waste at the household's kitchen sink and discharge it to the sewer, and the anaerobic co-digestion of separately collected food waste with sewage sludge, were selected for comparison due to their potential to create synergies between local authorities, waste and water companies, with local circumstances determining which of the two options to adopt. A simplified process used for assessing and comparing the two food waste management options in the Anglian region in the UK, indicated that there are benefits in using the framework as a screening tool for identifying which option may be the most sustainable. To support decision-making, a detailed analysis that incorporates stakeholders' perspectives is required. An additional use of the framework can be in providing recommendations for optimising food waste management options in a specific region, maximising their sustainability performance.","output":"A multi-criteria sustainability assessment framework: development and application in comparing two food waste management options using a UK region as a case study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular organelle.

This study aimed to determine baseline vitamin D serum concentrations and the effects of its supplementation in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 outpatients. Methods: 42 outpatients were included, 22 of which received a supplement of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 14 days; the remaining 20 outpatients were designated as a control group. Serum levels of transferrin, ferritin, vitamin D, and D-dimer were measured at baseline in both groups. After 14 days, serum levels of total vitamin D were determined in the supplemented group. Results: At baseline, only 19% of infected outpatients had vitamin D levels corresponding to sufficiency. All outpatients with vitamin D insufficiency had at least one symptom associated with the disease, while only 75% of patients with symptoms presented sufficiency. On the seventh and fourteenth day of follow-up, the supplemented group presented fewer symptoms with respect to those non-supplemented. A vitamin D3 dose of 10,000 IU/daily for 14 days was sufficient to raise vitamin D serum concentrations. Conclusions: Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D appear to be linked to the development of symptoms in positive outpatients. Vitamin D supplementation could have significant benefits in the Western Mexican population.","output":"Vitamin D Levels in COVID-19 Outpatients from Western Mexico: Clinical Correlation and Effect of Its Supplementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was exported to Korea in 2015, resulting in a threat to neighboring nations.

Previously published studies have often focused on the therapeutic effects related to OPD's antioxidant capacity but underestimated the cytotoxicity-related side effects of OPD, which may result in unpredictable risks. In this study, we reported another side effect of OPD, hemolysis, and what was unexpected was that this side effect also appeared with OPD. Although hemolysis effects for saponins are familiar to researchers, the hemolytic behavior of OPD or OPD and the interactions between these two isomers are unique. Therefore, we investigated the effects of OPD and OPD alone or in combination on the hemolytic behavior in vitro and in vivo and adopted chemical compatibility and proteomics methods to explain the potential mechanism. Meanwhile, to explain the drug-drug interactions (DDIs), molecular modeling was applied to explore the possible common targets. In this study, we reported that OPD caused hemolysis both in vitro and in vivo, while OPD only caused hemolysis in vivo. We clarified the differences and DDIs in the hemolytic behavior of the two isomers. An analysis of the underlying mechanism governing this phenomenon showed that hemolysis caused by OPD or OPD was related to the destruction of the redox balance of erythrocytes. In vivo, in addition to the redox imbalance, the proteomics data demonstrated that lipid metabolic disorders and mitochondrial energy metabolism are extensively involved by hemolysis. We provided a comprehensive description of the hemolysis of two isomers in Ophiopogon japonicus, and risk warnings related to hemolysis were presented.

In this work, we calculate the conductance of a series of acene derivatives connected to gold electrodes using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. We show that these systems have near length-independent conductance and can exhibit a conductance increase with molecular length depending on the connection to the electrodes. The analysis of the molecular orbital energies and transmission functions attribute this behavior to the dramatic decrease of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap with length, which shifts the transmission peaks near the Fermi level. These results demonstrate that the anchoring configuration determines the conductance behavior of acene derivatives, which are optimal building blocks to fabricate single-molecule devices with tunable charge transport properties.","output":"Nonexponential Length Dependence of Molecular Conductance in Acene-Based Molecular Wires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) after both BioNTech-Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine doses and study the correlation with self-perceived adverse reactions.

Most of the countries adopted severe restrictions on drinking place functioning. Alcohol retail store sales temporal data were used to examine alcohol sales changes in the United States (U.S.) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as a proxy indicator of at-home drinking. Data were sourced from the Monthly Retail Trade Survey, which has provided U.S. representative estimates of sales at retail and food services stores since 1951. In the present study, we analyzed data from seasonally adjusted beer, wine, and liquor store (BWLS) sales from January 1992 to September 2020. Poisson cubic spline models were used to assess nonlinearity in such sales during the period. These models were adjusted to the consumer price index for alcoholic beverages. There was a significant increase in retail alcohol sales during the beginning of the pandemic, reaching a plateau in the third quarter of 2020. During the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020), there were 41.9 billion dollars in BWLS sales, representing an increase of 20% compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, food and drinking place retail sales decreased by 27% during the same period in the same survey. These results may indicate an increase in home drinking during the period, which could potentially lead to higher alcohol consumption and alcohol-related adverse health outcomes.

Systems of detection, investigation and intervention for maltreated children are the subject of continued review and debate.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of the formal use of family group decision\\\\making (FGDM) in terms of child safety, permanence (of child's living situation), child and family well\\\\being, and client satisfaction with the decision\\\\making process.Search MethodsBoth published and unpublished manuscripts were considered eligible for this review. Library staff from Scholarly Information (Brownless Biomedical Library) University of Melbourne, conducted 14 systematic bibliographic searches. Reviewers also checked the reference lists of all relevant articles obtained, and reference lists from previously published reviews. Researchers also hand\\\\searched 10 relevant journals.Selection CriteriaStudy samples of children and young people, aged 0C18 years, who have been the subject of a child maltreatment investigation, were eligible for this review. Studies had to have used random assignment to create treatment and control groups;or, parallel cohorts in which groups were assessed at the same point in time. Any form of FGDM, used in the course of a child maltreatment investigation or service, was considered an eligible intervention if it involved: a concerted effort to convene family, extended family, and community members;and professionals;and involved a planned meeting with the intention of working collaboratively to develop a plan for the safety well\\\\being of children;with a focus on family\\\\centred decision\\\\making.Data Collection and AnalysisTwo review authors independently extracted the necessary data from each study report, using the software application Covidence. Covidence highlighted discrepancies between data extracted by separate reviewers, further analysis was conducted until a consensus was reached on what data were to be included in the review. Two authors also independently conducted analyses of study bias.Main ResultsEighteen eligible study reports were found, providing findings from 15 studies, involving 18 study samples. Four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs;N = 941) the remainder employed quasi\\\\experimental designs with parallel cohorts. Three of the quasi\\\\experimental studies used prospective evaluations of nonrandomly assigned comparison groups (N = 4,368);the rest analysed pre\\\\existing survey data, child protection case files or court data (N = 91,786). The total number of children studied was 97,095. The longest postintervention follow\\\\up period was 3 years. Only four studies were conducted outside the United States;two in Canada and one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The review authors judged there to be a moderate or high risk of bias, in most of the bias categories considered. Only one study referenced a study protocol. Eleven of the fifteen studies were found to have a high likelihood of selection bias (73%). Baseline imbalance bias was deemed to be unlikely in just two studies, and highly likely in nine (60%). Confounding variables were judged to be highly likely in four studies (27%), and contamination bias was judged highly likely in five studies (33%). Researcher allegiance was rated as a high risk in three studies (20%) where the authors argued for the benefits of FGDM within the article, but without supporting references to an appropriate evidence base. Bias from differential diagnostic activity, and funding source bias, were less evident across the evidence reviewed. This review combines findings for eight FGDM outcome measures. Findings from RCTs were available for four outcomes, but none of these, combined in meta\\\\analysis or otherwise, were statistically significant. Combining findings from the quasi\\\\experimental studies provided one statistically significant finding, for the reunification of families, f vouring FGDM. Ten effect sizes, from nine quasi\\\\experimental studies, were synthesised to examine effects on the reunification of children with their family or the effect on maintaining in\\\\home care;in short, the effect FGDM has on keeping families together. There was a high level of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 92%). The overall effect, based on the combination of these studies was positive, small, but statistically significant: odds ratio (OR), 1.69 (confidence interval [CI], 1.03, 2.78). Holinshead's (2017) RCT also measured the maintenance on in\\\\home care and reported a similar result: OR, 1.54 (CI, ?0.19, 0.66) not statistically significant. The overall effect for continued maltreatment from meta\\\\analysis of five quasi\\\\experimental studies, favoured the FGDM group, but was not statistically significant: OR, 0.73 (CI, 0.48, 1.11). The overall combined effect for continued maltreatment, reported in RCTs, favoured the control group. But it was not statistically significant: OR, 1.29 (CI, 0.85, 1.98). Five effect sizes, from nonrandomised studies, were synthesised to examine the effect of FGDM on the number of kinship placements. The overall positive effect based on the combination of these studies was negligible: OR, 1.31 (CI, 0.94, 1.82). Meta\\\\analysis was not possible with other outcomes. FGDM's role in expediting case processing and case closures was investigated in six studies, three of which reported findings favouring FGDM, and three which favoured the comparison group. Children's placement stability was reported in two studies: an RCT's findings favoured the control, while a quasi\\\\experimental study's findings favoured FGDM. Three studies reported findings for service user satisfaction: one had only 30 participants, one reported a statistically significant positive effect for FGDM, the other found no difference between FGDM and a control. Engagement with support services was reported in two studies;neither reported statistically significant findings.Authors' ConclusionsThe current evidence base, in this field, is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of FGDM. These models of child protection decision\\\\making may help bring about better outcomes for children at risk, or they may increase the risk of further maltreatment. Further research of rigour, designed to avoid the potential biases of previous evaluations, is needed.","output":"Family group decision\\\\making for children at risk of abuse or neglect: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid and accurate detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is critical for effective control of tuberculosis (TB). Herein, we established a novel, low cost strategy having high accuracy and speed for the detection of M. tuberculosis drug resistance, using gene splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE PCR). METHODS: The SOE PCR assay and Sanger sequencing are designed and constructed to detect mutations of rpoB, embB, katG, and inhA promoter, which have been considered as the major contributors to rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol (EMB) resistance in M. tuberculosis. One hundred and eight M. tuberculosis isolates came from mycobacterial cultures of TB cases at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center in China from December 2018 to April 2019, of which 56 isolates were tested with the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Performance evaluation of the SOE PCR technique was compared with traditional mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) or GeneXpert MTB/RIF among these isolates. Kappa identity test was used to analyze the consistency of the different diagnostic methods. RESULTS: We found that the mutations of S531L, S315T and M306V were most prevalent for RFP, INH and EMB resistance, respectively, in the 108 M. tuberculosis isolates. Compared with phenotypic DST, the sensitivity and specificity of the SOE PCR assay for resistance detection were 100.00% and 88.00% for RFP, 94.64% and 94.23% for INH, and 68.97% and 79.75% for EMB, respectively. Compared with the GeneXpert MTB/RIF, the SOE PCR method was completely consistent with results of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF, with a concordance of 100% for resistance to RFP. CONCLUSIONS: In present study, a novel SOE PCR diagnostic method was successfully developed for the accurate detection of M. tuberculosis drug resistance. Our results using this method have a high consistency with that of traditional phenotypic DST or GeneXpert MTB/RIF, and SOE PCR testing in clinical isolates can also be conducted rapidly and simultaneously for detection of drug resistance to RFP, EMB, and INH.

The data were collected by using schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children-present and lifetime version, kid-coping orientation to problems experienced (Kid-COPE), social support appraisals scale (SSAS), and COPE. RESULTS All three groups were similar with respect to age and sex distribution. Around 50% to 60% of the children in both patient groups had a psychiatric diagnosis. Remarkably, 30% of the children had an internalizing disorder. The most commonly used coping style by the mothers was religious coping in all groups. Kid-COPE scores did not significantly differ between groups.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between satisfaction with online teaching, social interaction with depression, anxiety symptomatology, and to analyze the effects of the pandemic and the lockdown in mental care access. Methods: The online survey collected demographic data, satisfaction with online teaching, and social interaction. We evaluated the depression and anxiety symptomatology using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, respectively. For the PHQ-9, we used the cut-off 15 for moderately severe depressive symptoms, whereas for GAD-7, we recurred to the cut-off 10 for moderately severe anxiety symptoms. This study used three data points: October 2019, June 2020, and March 2021. Findings: The study included n = 366 participants from all university study fields, with a mean age of 21.71 (SD = 1.42) in the last survey, and 71.3% were women. Depressive symptoms increased significantly from October 2019 to June 2020, and the mean scores grew until March 2021. Anxiety symptoms also significantly increased from October 2019 to June 2020; however, from June 2020 to March 2021, there was a non-significant decrease in the proportion. Mean scores for satisfaction with online teaching were 38.23% in June 2020 and 34.25% in March 2021, a non-significant difference. Satisfaction with social interaction significantly decreased from 37.35% in 2020 to 24.41% in 2021. Participants with scores above the cut-off of moderately severe and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms showed significantly lower satisfaction with online teaching than students with lower depression and anxiety scores. Despite the significant increase in clinical symptomatology, help-seeking behaviors did not change accordingly, and more than 50% of the students with mild or severe depressive and anxiety symptomatology did not get treatment during the pandemic. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that most students are dissatisfied with online teaching and the type of social interaction they were forced to adopt because of the pandemic. The severity of depressive and anxiety symptomatology significantly increased between October 2019 and March 2021, but help-seeking behaviors did not increase accordingly.","output":"The Association Between Changes in the University Educational Setting and Peer Relationships: Effects in Students' Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of crisis, the American public looks to the president for leadership that will usher the country successfully to the other side of troubled times.

Several methods have been presented to detect COVID-19 disease. Computer vision methods have been widely utilized to detect COVID-19 by using chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. This work introduces a model for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using CT images. A novel handcrafted feature generation technique and a hybrid feature selector are used together to achieve better performance. The primary goal of the proposed framework is to achieve a higher classification accuracy than convolutional neural networks (CNN) using handcrafted features of the CT images. In the proposed framework, there are four fundamental phases, which are preprocessing, fused dynamic sized exemplars based pyramid feature generation, ReliefF, and iterative neighborhood component analysis based feature selection and deep neural network classifier. In the preprocessing phase, CT images are converted into 2D matrices and resized to 256  256 sized images. The proposed feature generation network uses dynamic-sized exemplars and pyramid structures together. Two basic feature generation functions are used to extract statistical and textural features. The selected most informative features are forwarded to artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN) for classification. ANN and DNN models achieved 94.10% and 95.84% classification accuracies respectively.

Thus, this study sought to assess the impacts of social distancing on the practice of physical activity of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This was a transversal study carried out using an online form to collect sociodemographic, practice of physical activity, and social distancing data. Of the 472 participants, 85.6% reported that they were respecting the steps of social distancing. Social distancing affected the practice of physical activity in adherence to the habit of practicing in frequency, duration, and perception of change in intensity. An association was found between noticing a lot of stress in the home environment and stopping physical activity; lower levels of tolerance to social distancing were associated with less physical activity, and maintaining the habit of practicing physical activity was associated with decreasing the intensity of the practice. Hence, social distancing harmed the practice of physical activity as part of the treatment of individuals with T1DM, both in the habit of practicing and in the characteristics of these practices of physical activity, such as frequency, duration, and intensity.","output":"Social Distancing, Physical Activity, and COVID-19: Implications for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discovering new medicines is the hallmark of human endeavor to live a better and longer life. Yet the pace of discovery has slowed down as we need to venture into more wildly unexplored biomedical space to find one that matches today's high standard. Modern AI-enabled by powerful computing, large biomedical databases, and breakthroughs in deep learning-offers a new hope to break this loop as AI is rapidly maturing, ready to make a huge impact in the area. In this paper we review recent advances in AI methodologies that aim to crack this challenge. We organize the vast and rapidly growing literature of AI for drug discovery into three relatively stable sub-areas: (a) representation learning over molecular sequences and geometric graphs; (b) data-driven reasoning where we predict molecular properties and their binding, optimize existing compounds, generate de novo molecules, and plan the synthesis of target molecules; and (c) knowledge-based reasoning where we discuss the construction and reasoning over biomedical knowledge graphs.

To design potent antimicrobials, we made use of the antimicrobial peptide database (APD). Using the database filtering technology, we identified a useful template and converted it into an effective peptide WW291 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we compared the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of a family of peptides obtained from sequence permutation of WW291. The resulting eight WW peptides (WW291-WW298) gained different activities against a panel of bacteria. While WW295 inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, WW298 was highly active against S. aureus USA300 LAC. Consistently with this, WW298 was more effective in permeating or depolarizing the S. aureus membranes, whereas WW295 potently permeated the E. coli membranes. In addition, WW298, but not WW295, inhibited the MRSA attachment and could disrupt its preformed biofilms more effectively than daptomycin. WW298 also protected wax moths Galleria mellonella from MRSA infection causing death. Thus, sequence permutation provides one useful avenue to generating antimicrobial peptides with varying activity spectra. Taken together with amino acid composition modulation, these methods may lead to narrow-spectrum peptides that are more promising to selectively eliminate invading pathogens without damaging commensal microbiota.","output":"Sequence Permutation Generates Peptides with Different Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the differences in thermal effects on vocal folds between four fiber-routed lasers. METHODS: In this experimental laboratory study the thermal effects of an AcuPulse Duo CO2 (CO2 AP), UltraPulse Duo CO2 (CO2 UP), KTP, and Blue laser were analyzed using a Schlieren technique on a human tissue mimicking gel model. Power, laser duration, laser fiber distance to tissue and mode (continuous wave [CW] vs pulsed [P] modes) were evaluated in varying combinations in order to compare the effects of the tested lasers and to explore the individual effect on thermal expansion and incision depth of each setting. The model was validated by comparing the results from the Schlieren model with histology of ex vivo fresh human vocal folds after laser irradiation using a selection of the same laser settings, and calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: One thousand ninety-eight Schlieren experiments and 56 vocal cord experiments were conducted. In comparison with CW mode, less thermal expansion occurred in P mode in all lasers, while incisions were deeper in the CO2 and more superficial in the KTP and Blue lasers. The mean thermal expansion was found to be minimally smaller, whereas incision depth was pronouncedly smaller in the KTP and Blue compared to the CO2 lasers. Duration of laser irradiation was the most important factor of influence on thermal expansion and incision depth for all lasers in both CW and P modes. The ICC for consistency between the results of the Schlieren model and the vocal cord histology was classified from fair to excellent, except for the thermal expansion of the Blue laser, which was classified as poor. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates important differences in thermal effects between CO2, KTP, and Blue lasers which can be explained by the different physical characteristics of the P modes and divergence of the fiber delivery system. The Schlieren imaging model is a good predictor of the relative thermal effects in vocal fold tissue. Our results can be used as a guidance for ENT surgeons using fiber-routed lasers, in order to achieve effective treatment of vocal fold lesions and prevention of functional impairment of vocal folds.","output":"Thermal Effects of CO2, KTP, and Blue Lasers with a Flexible Fiber Delivery System on Vocal Folds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ways of development and modernization of modern higher education are largely determined by the scientific and technological progress.

While population health research has increasingly incorporated community stakeholders into the research continuum, basic and translational sciences struggle to do the same and may contribute to cancer disparities. We designed and implemented a virtual CS program at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (LCC). We report barriers, facilitators, and lessons learned. Methods: Translational scientists (TSs) were recruited from among LCC investigators, and CSs were identified for participation from among LCC community networks. We sought to recruit a CS cohort representing LCC's catchment area and a TS cohort whose research focuses on cancers most impacting LCC catchment. CS program interactions included monthly meetings between two CSs and one TS wherein the CS-TS triad discuss TS research in lay terms and work together to co-create educational infographics suitable for dissemination to the catchment and LCC scientists. Virtual attendance was tracked and meeting recordings retroactively reviewed to identify and create product development. Results: Six CSs and three TSs agreed to participate in the CS program. The CS cohort includes cancer survivors, patient advocates, community organization leaders, a nurse, and an educator, while the TS cohort includes breast, prostate, and lung cancer researchers. Currently, 11 of 18 triad meetings have been completed, with attendance averaging 97%. Barriers to program implementation have included technological difficulties, restrictions on in-person meeting, scheduling conflicts, time limitation, and language barriers, while facilitators have included small group meetings to promote comfortable group-member contribution, presence of a trained facilitator, articulation of achievable meeting goals and mission for product creation, and clear assignment of team roles. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated pre-existing needs for improved connectivity between communities impacted by cancer disparities and cancer researchers. By identifying current barriers and facilitators to successful virtual CS program implementation, our findings can be used to guide development and implementation of similar programs at LCC and other cancer centers that are aimed at mitigating cancer health disparities.","output":"Connecting cancer research and communities: Assessing barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a community scientist program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As it has been established in previous publications of the author, the current extra-hospital statistics referring to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are far from being minimally satisfactory (14%-17% success). Since the appearance of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, its application has been increasingly undermined as other subsequent pandemics (H1N1, Ebola, coronavirus disease 2019) seriously infringing lay rescuers intervention during classical CPR steps (mouth-to-mouth ventilation), forcing to modify vital support protocols. Both KI-1 Yong quan and PC-9 Zhong chong alternative rescue maneuvers could come to aid those victims of impending death situation due to both cardiac arrest or stroke, upgrading current survival rates of said unfortunate patients. AIM: To validate a complementary resuscitation maneuver originated in Chinese Medicine knowledge, carefully integrated into international CPR protocols [World Journal of Critical Care Medicine (WJCCM), August 2013]. METHODS: The model to verify its statistical validity of quoted research was the Retrospective Cohort Study, which redeems the semiotic paradigm that gave rise to medical semiotics. Its value strives in the differential detail if the deceased patients are considered the control group instead of the patients that may be deceased. Thus, combining the semiotic paradigm with the Retrospective Cohort Study allows us to manage the collateral potential lethal effects of the random process in cases of extreme emergencies. RESULTS: The statistic results provided by the methodological analysis of this work were previously published in WJCCM August 2013, ISSN 2220-3141). In a total of 89 patients in which the Yong quan maneuver was tested, 75 survived and 14 died. In order to compare this data with the percentages of survivors in the other maneuvers, we stipulate the assumption that if 89 patients are the 100% of the sample, how many patients would survive if the survival rate is 6.4% in CPR, 30% in defibrillation and 48% in CPR + defibrillation. By this way we obtained the approximate values of patients that would survive when applying these classical resuscitation maneuvers. Then we obtained the format of the tables to perform the exact Fisher test with the help of a statistical processor; the consequent result in a valuation of P < 0.0001 was considered \\"extremely statistically significant\\".

The proposed model is composed of two levels: the first level reflects the companys goal of maximizing profitability by offering competitive salaries to candidates. The second level reflects the candidates goal of minimizing the gap between their desired salary and the perceived benefits of a preferred flexible plan. We show that the model provides an exact solution based on a mixed integer formulation and presents a computational analysis based on changing candidate behaviors in response to the firms strategy thus demonstrates how the problems parameters influence the decision policy. Our proposed model leads to efficient managerial practices, compared to conventional models that utilize a single non-flexible plan. Results indicate that introducing a flexible work plan leads to an improvement of up to 59 percent in the firms profitability.

First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine.

The WR321 mAb broadly neutralized CCR5-tropic strains of HIV-1 to prevent infection of the cells. The mAb also exhibited direct interaction with cells in the culture, resulting in secretion of chemokines that interfered with the interaction of HIV-1 virions with CCR5, the coreceptor for HIV-1 on the susceptible cells, leading to inhibition of infection by HIV-1.

Murine anti-phosphoinositide mAbs similar to WR321 have previously been directly microinjected into a variety of cultured cells, resulting in important changes in the functions of the cells. The present results suggest that binding of a mAb to phosphoinositides, resulting in secretion of -chemokines into the culture medium and neutralization of infection by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of nearby susceptible cells, occurred by uptake and binding of the mAb at an intracellular location in the cultured cells that then led to secretion of HIV-1-inhibitory -chemokines.","output":"Inhibition of HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by a monoclonal antibody that binds to phosphoinositides and induces secretion of -chemokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The increase in COVID-19 cases is generating fear and concern in society, which generates an emotional response that influences the adoption of health-related behaviors The objective of the study was to design and validate the Scale of Worry for Contagion of COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19) Method The study had a descriptive cross-sectional design The population were young people and adults who resided in the cities of Lima and Callao during the declaration of the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic 816 young people and adults from Lima and Callao (200 men and 616 women, Medad = 28 40;SD age = 7 10) participated during the period from March 16 to 27, 2020, who were recruited through a non-probability sample The PRE-COVID-19, the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 and a single item were applied to measure the general perception of health The scales were shared using a Google form through social networks An internal consistency reliability analysis and structural equation models were performed, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (AFC) The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles that guide the ethical practice of online studies were followed Results The results show a one-dimensional model with satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices (2 (9) = 52 00;CFI = 99;RMSEA = 09 [ 07, 12];WRMR = 85) The  of the model were higher than 0 50 and the reliability had an excellent value ( = 90) Likewise, the convergent and discriminant validity is evident between PRE-COVID-19 and measures of anxiety, well-being and self-reported health Conclusion The results indicate that the PRE-COVID-19 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure concern about the spread of COVID-19 and the emotional impact on people Resumen Objetivo El incremento de los casos de la COVID-19 est generando miedo y preocupacin en la sociedad, lo que genera una respuesta emocional que influye en la adopcin de comportamientos relacionados con la salud El objetivo del estudio fue dise?ar y validar la Escala de Preocupacin por el Contagio de la COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19) Mtodo El estudio tiene dise?o descriptivo transversal La poblacin han sido jvenes y adultos residentes en las ciudades de Lima y Callao durante la declaracin de la emergencia sanitaria nacional por la pandemia del COVID-19 durante el periodo del 16 al 27 de marzo de 2020 quienes fueron reclutados a travs de un muestreo no probabilstico Se aplicaron la PRE-COVID-19, la WHO-Five Well-Being Index, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 y un tem nico para medir la percepcin general de salud Las escalas fueron compartidas mediante un formulario de Google a travs de redes sociales Se realiz un anlisis de fiabilidad por consistencia interna y modelos de ecuaciones estructurales, especficamente el anlisis factorial confirmatorio (AFC) Se siguieron las recomendaciones de la Declaracin de Helsinki y los principios que guan la prctica tica de los estudios va online Resultados Participaron 816 jvenes y adultos de Lima y Callao (200 varones y 616 mujeres, Medad = 28 40;DEedad = 7 10) Los resultados muestran un modelo unidimensional con ndices de bondad de ajuste satisfactorios (2 (9) = 52 00;CFI = 99;RMSEA = 09 [ 07, 12];WRMR = 85) Las  del modelo fueron superiores a 0 50 y la fiabilidad tuvo un valor excelente ( = 90) Asimismo, se evidencia la validez convergente y discriminante entre la PRE-COVID-19 y medidas de ansiedad, bienestar y salud autoinformada Conclusin Los resultados indican que la PRE-COVID-19 es un instrumento vlido y fiable para medir la preocupacin por el contagio de la COVID-19 y el impacto emocional en las personas","output":"Design and validation of a scale to measure worry about contagion by COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: Brindar orientaciones respecto al funcionamiento de los programas de inmunizacin en el contexto de la pandemia de COVID-19","output":"El programa de inmunizacin en el contexto de la pandemia de COVID-19, versin 2 (24 de abril del 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To establish the magnitude and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the General Pueyrredn, Buenos Aires, Argentina: the INECOVID study. METHODS Prospective cohort designed with participants from the District general population. The follow-up period was from June 22nd to December 18th, 2020, with a minimum appointment interval of 21 days. Data were obtained via questionnaires and serum or plasma samples. The primary event was considered as the time to seroconversion (IgG) as evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The accumulated risk of infection was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Cox models were built with time-dependent variables. RESULTS 345 participants were recruited (n=222 women, 64.3%; 123 men, 35.7%), with a median age of 45 years in women (Interquartile range: 19) and 49 in men (Interquartile range: 26). 12.8% of participants (n=44) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection [incidence density of 9.1 cases (women: 11.1, men: 5.1) per 10,000 person-day]. 36.4% of the cases (n=16) were asymptomatic. The following factors were associated to the risk of infection: being in close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case (HR=5.56; 95%CI 2.85-10.83), being a health worker (HR=2.93; 95%CI 1.55-5.52), living in crowded conditions (HR=2.23; 95%CI 1.13-4.49), and age (HR=0.98; 95%CI 0.95-1.00).

In particular, among various negative feelings, fear seems to be one of the main emotional reactions that can be as contagious as the virus itself. The actual pandemic is likely to function as an important stressor, especially in terms of chronic anxiety and lack of control over the succession of unforeseeable environmental events. In this direction, the psychological impact of previous quarantine measures showed important negative psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTTS) with long-lasting effects. The presence of psychological discomfort and disturbances due to negative contextual factors can be studied using the nocebo phenomenon as a possible theoretical explanatory framework. Although in the absence of studies linking nocebo to Covid-19 and data-driven evidence, the context of the actual pandemic may be seen as a fertile ground for amplified discomfort and anxiety. The media provide dramatic and negative descriptions and often present conflicting sources of information, which can lead to physical and mental health problems, diminishing response to treatment. This can be worse when supported by conspiracy theories or misinformation. The aim of this perspective review is to propose a new theoretical framework for the COVID-19 pandemic, which should be supported by future empirical studies.

We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and activation components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage. METHODS: Our community-academic-public health partnership, Unidos en Salud, utilized a theory-informed approach to design our Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategys design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco.

Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients 16 years old were used in the evaluation. RESULTS: There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32C56) years, 53.9% were male and 70.5% were Latinx, 14.1% white, 7.7% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 5.3% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1% vs. 33.5%), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2% vs. 30.1%), not have health insurance (47.3% vs. 16.0%), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4% vs. 36.2%). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew 3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n = 729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to 3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of minimum and maximum rise time and inspiratory cycling criteria settings on 6 new generation ventilators. Our hypothesis was there would be a difference in the exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow among 6 different ventilators, based, on change in rise time and cycling criteria. METHODS The research utilized a breathing simulator and 4 different ventilator models. All mechanical ventilators were set to a spontaneous mode of ventilation with settings of pressure support 8 cm H2O and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. A minimum and maximum setting for rise time and cycling criteria were examined. Exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow measurements were recorded for each simulation. RESULTS Significant (P < .001) differences were found when comparing minimum and maximum rise time and minimum and maximum cycling criteria for each ventilator. CONCLUSIONS Significant differences in exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow were observed by adjusting rise time and cycling criteria. This research demonstrates that during pressure support ventilation strategy, adjustments in rise time and/or cycling criteria can produce changes in inspiratory parameters. Obviously, this finding has important implications for practitioners who utilize a similar pressure support strategy when conducting a ventilator wean.

Hence, immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are introduced rapidly without requiring FDA emergency use authorization approval. Thus, evaluation of test performance predominantly relies on laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the test performance of recently launched commercial immunoassays in serum and plasma samples. Methods 51 serum samples from 26 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after end of quarantine and 25 control patients were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope to assess diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. 20 matching pairs of serum and plasma samples were included to analyze comparability between different specimens. Results Overall, a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, 96.2-100% and 100% with a respective diagnostic specificity of 100%, 100% and 84-86% for the immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope were determined. In total, 84-96 % of samples were correctly classified as negative and 92.3-95.2% as positive. The level of concordance between plasma- and serum-based testing diverged between the assays (Epitope r2=0.97; Euroimmun r2=0.91; Roche r2=0.76). Conclusions The immunoassays from Euroimmun and Roche revealed a higher specificity than the Epitope assay without a substantial drop of diagnostic sensitivity. Significant differences between plasma- and serum-based testing highlights the need for determination of appropriate cut-offs per specimen type.

Definitive diagnosis of TOS was made by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) with maneuvers. RESULTS A total of 67 patients underwent robotic first rib resection. Neurogenic TOS: 39 patients underwent robotic resection for Neurologic Symptoms of the upper extremity (Neurogenic TOS). There were 14 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 34  9.5 years. Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) or Venous TOS: 28 patients underwent transthoracic robotic first rib resection for PSS. There were 16 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 24  8.5 years. Operative time was 87.6  10.8 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 days with a median hospitalization of 3 days. There were no neurovascular complications. There was no mortality. In patients with Neurogenic TOS, QuickDASH Scores (mean  SEM) decreased from 60.3  2.1 preoperatively to 5  2.3 in the immediate postoperative period and to 3.5  1.1 at 6 months (p<0001). Immediate relief of symptoms was seen in 35/39 patients (91%). Persistent paresthesia was seen in 4/39 (9%) immediately postop, and in 2/39 (2.5%) at 6 months. Thirty-seven of 39 (97.5%) patients reported complete relief of symptoms. Among patients with PSS or Venous TOS, 9/28 (32%) required endovascular venoplasty to completely open the subclavian vein after the relief of extrinsic compression. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients with PSS had an open subclavian vein, for a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS Robotic transthoracic first rib resection allows for minimally invasive resection of the first rib in patients with TOS, with excellent relief of symptoms and no neurovascular complications.","output":"Robotic First Rib Resection for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ciguatera is one of the most widespread food poisonings caused by the ingestion of fish contaminated by ciguatoxins (CTXs). Snapper and grouper with high palatable and economic value are the primary food source and fish species for exportation in the Republic of Kiribati, but they are highly suspected CTX-contaminated species due to their top predatory characteristics. In this study, 60 fish specimens from 17 species of snappers and groupers collected from the Kiritimati Island and Marakei Island of the Republic of Kiribati were analyzed using mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine Pacific CTX-1, -2 and -3 (P-CTX-1, -2 and -3). The LC-MS/MS results show that CTXs were detected in 74.5% of specimens from Marakei Island and 61.5% of specimens from Kiritimati Island. The most toxic fish Epinephelus coeruleopunctatus from Marakei Island and Cephalopholis miniata from Kiritimati Island were detected as 53-fold and 28-fold P-CTX-1 equivalents higher than the safety level of 10 pg/g P-CTX-1 equivalents, respectively. CTX levels and composition profiles varied with species and location. The N2a results suggested that fish specimens also contain high levels of other CTX-like toxins or sodium channel activators. The distribution patterns for ciguatoxic fish of the two islands were similar, with fish sampled from the northwest being more toxic than the southwest. This study shows that groupers and snappers are high-risk species for ciguatera in the Republic of Kiribati, and these species can further be used as indicator species in ciguatera endemic areas for risk assessment.","output":"The Occurrence, Distribution, and Toxicity of High-Risk Ciguatera Fish Species (Grouper and Snapper) in Kiritimati Island and Marakei Island of the Republic of Kiribati"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. METHODS: Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the 'lockdown' period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. RESULTS: Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. DISCUSSION: Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.","output":"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: Changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Calcium dysregulation (\\"Calcium Hypothesis\\") is an early and critical event in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Calcium binds to and regulates the small regulatory protein calmodulin that in turn binds to and regulates several hundred calmodulin binding proteins. Initial and continued research has shown that many calmodulin binding proteins mediate multiple events during the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, thus establishing the \\"Calmodulin Hypothesis\\". To gain insight into the general applicability of this hypothesis, the involvement of calmodulin in neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other dementias was explored. After a literature search for calmodulin binding, 11 different neuroinflammatory proteins (TREM2, CD33, PILRA, CR1, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1, ABCA1, CH3L1/YKL-40 and NLRP3) were scanned for calmodulin binding domains using the Calmodulin Target Database. This analysis revealed the presence of at least one binding domain within which visual scanning demonstrated the presence of valid binding motifs. Coupled with previous research that identified 13 other neuroinflammation linked proteins (BACE1, BIN1, CaMKII, PP2B, PMCA, NOS, NMDAR, AchR, Ado A2AR, A, APOE, SNCA, TMEM175), this work shows that at least 24 critical proteins involved in neuroinflammation are putative or proven calmodulin binding proteins. Many of these proteins are linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases indicating that calmodulin binding proteins lie at the heart of neuroinflammatory events associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Since many calmodulin-based pharmaceuticals have been successfully used to treat Huntington's and other neurodegenerative diseases, these findings argue for their immediate therapeutic implementation.","output":"Calmodulin binding proteins and neuroinflammation in multiple neurodegenerative diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to create an image both in terms of description and in terms of graphical representation, with multiannual coverage (2007C2019), the evolution of the financial indicators of the population, and their impact on the national economy.

Nevertheless, theories suggest that individuals also often seek out solutions that may facilitate positive changes when they are faced with uncertainty and crisis. However, the existing literature has disproportionately focused on the negative effect of COVID-19 on adolescents, and scant research has examined to what extent and in what aspects adolescents would experience positive changes in times of the pandemic. This pre-registered research aims to bridge said gaps by: (1) exploring different profiles of positive changes in various life outcomes in Chinese adolescents over the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examining the role of resilience in differentiating different profiles; (3) comparing adolescents mental health across profiles. METHOD: Participants were 2,567 adolescents aged 12 to 24 recruited from 32 provinces in mainland China (66.89% females; M(age) = 19.87 years, SD = 2.02). Through an online survey, participants rated how much their lives of different domains had experienced positive changes since the outbreak of the pandemic. They also answered standardized questionnaires that measured their resilience and mental health. RESULTS: Results of latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: limited positive changes (33.3%), partial positive changes (49.5%), and overall strong positive changes (17.2%). Moreover, adolescents with a higher level of resilience were more likely to be categorized into the partial positive changes profile compared to the limited positive changes profile and categorized into the overall strong positive changes profile compared to the other two profiles, after controlling for multiple covariates. Adolescents in the overall strong positive changes profile had better mental health than their counterparts of the other two profiles. CONCLUSION: Chinese adolescents appear to experience positive changes in various life outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those with high levels of resilience. Such positive changes have important implications on adolescents mental health.","output":"Profiles of positive changes in life outcomes over the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adolescents: the role of resilience and mental health consequence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining an accurate diagnosis in indeterminate biliary strictures is challenging with historically low sensitivity of 50-60% as all presently available diagnostic modalities possess some degree of inherent limitations.1-3 However, the development of the second-generation single-operator cholangioscopy system (SpyGlassDS, Boston Scientific Corp.) has resulted in a significant improvement in the diagnostic sensitivity to 75-85%, and we have recently shown in a randomized trial that an accurate diagnosis can be established in 90% of patients with indeterminate biliary strictures.4,5.","output":"Single-operator cholangioscopy-guided biopsy of indeterminate bile duct strictures - Work in progress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promoting SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been a global mission since the first vaccines were approved for emergency use.

Here, we provide the results from vaccinating a single-center cohort of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). METHODS: In a prospective, open-label clinical trial, 50 patients with CVID and 90 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (Ab) production after one or two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Additionally, in selected patients, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T-cells were assessed. RESULTS: A potent vaccine-induced anti-spikeCspecific IgG Ab response was observed in all the HC. In contrast, only 68.3% of the CVID patients seroconverted, with median titers of specific Ab being 83-fold lower than in HC. In fact, only 4/46 patients (8.6%) of patients who were seronegative at baseline reached the threshold for an optimal response (250 U/mL). Using the EUROclass definition, patients with either a reduced proportion, but not absolute counts, of switched memory B-cells or having an increased frequency of CD21(low) B-cells generally generated poor vaccine responses. Overall, CVID-patients had reduced spike-specific IFN- positive CD4(+) T cell responses 2 weeks after the second dose, compared to HC. The total CD4 and CD4 central memory cell counts correlated with humoral immunity to the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: CVID patients with low frequency of switched memory B-cells or an increased frequency of CD21(low) B-cells according to the EUROclass definition demonstrated poor responses to Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination.

Occasionally, alternative perfusion access is required to prevent perfusion site-related complications. In this study, the feasibility of alternative perfusion strategies was verified by comparing the postoperative outcomes and complications. METHODS The records of 91 consecutive patients (68 women, 23 men; mean age 40.7  16.5 years) who underwent atrial septal defect (ASD) closure via a right minithoracotomy approach between January 2009 and September 2014 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those with single femoral arterial access (SF group, n = 84), and those with alternative perfusion access (ALT group, n = 7, bilateral femoral arterial cannulation in 6, side-arm graft anastomosed to the femoral artery in 1). RESULTS Femoral artery diameter was smaller in the ALT group than in the SF group (6.5  0.5 vs. 7.3  1.0 mm, P = 0.013). Operating time was longer in the ALT group than in the SF group (259.2  54.0 vs. 208.3  54.9 min, P = 0.031). One patient was converted to ascending aortic cannulation owing to high perfusion pressure. Postoperative major cardiac or cerebrovascular events, such as death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, did not occur in either group. CONCLUSIONS Alternative perfusion access was safe in ASD closure via a right minithoracotomy approach.

Settings and participants Nursing home residents, affected by COVID-19, were followed-up with a LUS from 08th April to 14th May 2020 in Chioggia, Venice. Methods COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored using a 12-zone method. For each of the 12 zones (two posterior, two anterior, two lateral), the possible score ranged from 0 to 3 (1= presence of B lines separated, < 50% of space from the pleural line; 2= presence of B lines separated, > 50% of space from the pleural line; 3= lung thickening with tissue-like aspect). The total score ranged from 0 to 36. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were reported. Results Over 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; mainly females) were affected by COVID-19. Twelve died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3.

Methods: Ninety-minute live online training workshops and frequently updated online support materials were offered for 6 weeks. Training was monitored via feedback collected at training sessions and a brief post-training survey. After training completion, a second survey was circulated to measure utilization outcomes and experiences with VH. Results: Eight hundred and ninety-five participants representing 82% of staff requiring support were trained through 101 sessions;348 (38.9%) and 272 (30.4%) responses were collected for the monitoring and outcome surveys, respectively.

Data was abstracted from each webinar including the date of delivery, topic of discussion, and number of speakers. Temporal trends were analyzed via join-point regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 450 webinars were offered in the initial 18 weeks following the pandemic declaration. A total of 629 speakers from 96 academic institutions were involved in at least one webinar. The mean webinar duration was 58.7 minutes. At the peak of the webinar frenzy, a mean of 7.1 webinars/day were offered with 12.7 speakers/day involved. Urologic webinars increased in availability significantly from weeks 1 to 9 and decreased in availability non-significantly from weeks 10 to 18. Urologic-oncology was the most commonly discussed sub-specialty, representing 113 (25.1%) separate lectures with 151 speakers. Urologic-oncology increased in interest significantly over weeks 1 to 9 (AWPC: 110.7%;p<0.001) with a stable trend (AWPC -5.5, p=0.3) from weeks 10 to 18. Prostate cancer (33.9%) was the most discussed subject, followed by bladder cancer (29.5%), kidney cancer (12.5%), testis cancer (8%), upper urinary tract cancer (7.2%) and penile cancer (3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates impressive and immediate reaction of the academic urologic community and specifically, the urologic-oncologic community, to continuing medical education amidst a pandemic. While webinars have some limitations, they have the opportunity to increase educational access across geographical and financial barriers. Time will show if webinars have a permanent role in the future of medical education or if we have witnessed the rise and fall of a webin-era..

The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.","output":"Bilateral Central Retinal Vein Occlusion in a 40-Year-Old Man with Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS The primary aim was to assess the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following total hip replacements (THR) in a low-risk patient group when using 150 mg aspirin as the pharmacological component of VTE prophylaxis on discharge. The secondary aim was to identify factors associated with an increased risk of a VTE event in this low-risk group. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing THR during a 63-month period. Patient demographics, socio-economic status, ASA grade, type of anaesthetic, length of surgery and BMI were recorded. A diagnosis of VTE was assigned to symptomatic patients with positive imaging for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or a pulmonary embolism (PE) within 8 weeks of surgery. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with VTE after THR. RESULTS 3880 patients underwent THR during the study period, of which 2740 (71%) were low risk and prescribed aspirin for VTE prophylaxis. There were 34 VTE events, of which 15 were DVTs and 18 were PEs, with 1 patient diagnosed with both. The incidence of VTE was 1.2%, with no VTE-related deaths. Patients incurring a VTE postoperatively were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, p = 0.022), of older age (OR 0.43, p = 0.047) and were more likely to be socially deprived (OR 0.32, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference with patients given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an inpatient prior to discharge on aspirin (p = 0.806), nor any difference with the type of anaesthetic used during surgery (p = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS Aspirin is a relatively safe and effective choice for VTE prophylaxis in low-risk patients undergoing THR. Male sex and age >70 years were twice as likely to sustain a VTE and patients from the most deprived socio-economic background are 3 times as likely.","output":"Incidence and risk factors associated with venous thromboembolism following primary total hip arthroplasty in low-risk patients when using aspirin for prophylaxis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the role of Platelet-rich plasma(PRP) from different sources in alleviating oxidative stress and ameliorating melanogenesis in UVB-irradiated PIG1 cells.

We2 and others3C6 recently reported results in this Journal confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of Omicron evolution has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K mutation (BA.1+R346K) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike mutations while lacking 13 spike mutations found in BA.1. We therefore extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.12,3,5,6. These findings indicate that these three sublineages of Omicron are antigenically equidistant from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and thus similarly threaten the efficacies of current vaccines. BA.2 also exhibited marked resistance to 17 of 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested, including S309 (sotrovimab)7, which had retained appreciable activity against BA.1 and BA.1+R346K2C4,6.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this problem because it made conducting face-to-face interviews even more difficult than before. For example, it made conducting face-to-face surveys infeasible in 2020 in South Korea, and so the Korean Academic Multimode Open Survey (KAMOS) was unable to conduct a planned face-to-face survey to recruit new panel members. The entire 8,514-member panel, established via two-stage probability-based sampling from 2016 to 2019, was invited to take three online/telephone surveys in 2020. Of these panel members, 1,352 responded to at least one survey in 2020. To test to what extent the panel remained representative of the adult South Korean population, we compared the two groups of panel members: Those who responded to at least one survey in 2020 and those who did not. After weighting both groups on the basis of age, sex, and geographical area, we analyzed their responses to some of the questions that were asked during multiple rounds of the face-to-face panel-recruiting interviews. Using Cohens d for survey items that could be analyzed numerically and Cramrs V for categorical items, we were able to conclude that the respondents to the 2020 surveys were equivalent to the non-respondents in terms of both demographics and in the answers they originally gave to substantive questions on a variety of topics related to social science or public opinion research, including questions about quality of life, societal issue, and politics (Cohen's d items <0.2, 95% CI;Cramrs V items <0.1, 95% CI). This analysis may provide a model for others who wish to test the continued representativeness of their panel or who would like to use a different survey mode or change some other aspect of their methodology and test whether it is equivalent to their former methodology. Our success in building a panel that retained its representativeness may be useful to those in other countries where face-to-face surveys had previously been the norm but are becoming increasingly difficult to conduct. ? 2021, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

However, the existence of different and continuously developing vaccine candidates coupled with the likelihood of continued application due to both waning immune responses and emergence of viral mutants, means that more basic research regarding their efficacy and continued application are needed. This is particularly true with use of preclinical models involving effects when given during pregnancy. The substantial body of data on the impact of maternal immune activation (MIA) on neurologic development and behavior in the progeny necessitates the need to have all vaccine candidates, particularly when inducing strong toll receptor (TLR) responses, involving these models. Use of other preclinical models involving autoimmunity and allergy coupled with incorporation of human modifying variables of aging and obesity should also be applied to better reflect the heterogeneity of the general population and potential off-target effects that may arise.

Although not problematic per se, desire thinking can become dysfunctional if it is used to regulate negative mood states and due to its ability to induce craving. This study tests a mediation model where desire thinking is hypothesized to mediate the association between emotional reactivity and craving among specific online activities. METHODS: The study comprised an online survey that was completed by 925 participants who indicated that their first-choice online activity was one out of social-networks use, shopping, gaming, gambling, or pornography viewing. In this sample, a structural equation model was tested where negative emotional reactivity, desire thinking, and craving were latently modelled in this serial order. RESULTS: Results indicated that higher levels in negative emotional reactivity significantly predicted higher desire thinking tendencies, which in turn significantly predicted higher cravings for online activities. The direct path between negative reactivity and craving was not significant. Further, our results support the two-factorial structure of a German version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (Caselli & Spada, 2011). DISCUSSION: The findings show that desire thinking might be initiated as an attempt to regulate negative affective states. This highlights its possible role as a maladaptive coping mechanism in the context of specific online activities due to the resulting craving responses, which in turn could promote the emergence of unwanted behaviors.","output":"Fleeing through the mind's eye: Desire thinking as a maladaptive coping mechanism among specific online activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vertical transmission of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still controversial Additionally, the consequences of the infection during pregnancy in the offspring also are unknown Case A transitory fetal skin edema and polyhydramnios have been demonstrated by ultrasound in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 after a negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 The fetal findings presented a spontaneous resolution in utero, and abnormal findings were not found in the newborn Conclusion Women who have undergone SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy should receive a subsequent appropriate follow-up in order to clarify the fetal consequences of the novel coronavirus, if any [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Case Reports in Obstetrics & Gynecology is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Transitory Fetal Skin Edema in a Pregnant Patient with a Mild SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global major concern.

Several studies have suggested that immune dysregulation and hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 are more involved in disease severity than the virus itself.Immune dysregulation due to COVID-19 is characterized by delayed and impaired interferon response, lymphocyte exhaustion and cytokine storm that ultimately lead to diffuse lung tissue damage and posterior thrombotic phenomena.Considering there is a lack of clinical evidence provided by randomized clinical trials, the knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 disease pathogenesis and immune response is a cornerstone to develop rationale-based clinical therapeutic strategies.

METHODS: A novel survey was sent to all faculty members at an academic pediatric orthopedic practice in New York City regarding their use of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Faculty members performed 227 unique tele-health visits with pediatric orthopedic patients over a 7-week period in early 2020, and this formed the basis for responses to the survey. The results of the faculty survey suggest that telemedicine has substantial clinical benefits for pediatric orthopedic surgeons and our patients that extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers recognize the limits of conducting physical exams over telemedicine and should always use clinical judgment when evaluating patients, par-ticularly trauma patients who may require prompt referral for additional care. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to provide pediatric orthopedic care through telemedicine has allowed us to safely evaluate and treat pediatric patients with musculoskeletal problems in New York City and its environs despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficient evaluation of both new and exist-ing pediatric orthopedic patients via telehealth is viable. Physical examination is the most challenging aspect of the physician-patient encounter to replicate virtually.

A majority (66%) also reported a low or moderate professional efficacy score, a negative finding. Measures of student burnout increased after the start of the program and remained at the higher level each subsequent year (p<0.0001). In the Spring of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every student had moderate or high levels of emotional exhaustion (97%) and cynicism (78%) as measured by the MBI. CONCLUSION This interim data suggests high degrees of pharmacy student burnout. Empathy levels remained stable throughout the duration of the study.

OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, preCCOVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits. RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the preCCOVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the preCCOVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes.

For this purpose, quality of life after successful surgical treatment of FRIs of long bones was assessed. METHODS: A total of 37 patients treated between November 2009 and March 2019, with achieved eradication of infection and stable bone consolidation after long bone FRI, were included. Quality of life was evaluated with the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and German Short-Form 36 (SF-36) outcome instruments as well as with an International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization (ICD)-10 based symptom rating (ISR) and compared to normative data. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 4.19 years (SD 2.7) after the last surgery, the mean SF-36 score was 40.1 (SD 14.6) regarding the physical health component and 48.7 (SD 5.1) regarding the mental health component, compared to German normative values of 48.4 (SD 9.2) (p < 0.001) and 50.9 (SD 8.8) (p = 0.143). The mean EQ-5D index reached 0.76 (SD 0.27) with a mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) rating of 65.7 (SD 22.7) compared to reference scores of 0.88 (p < 0.001) and 72.9 (p < 0.001). Mean scores of the ISR did not reveal significant psychological symptom burden, while an individual analysis showed moderate to severe impairments in 21.6% (n = 8) of the patients. CONCLUSION: Even a mean 4.2 years (SD 2.7) after surgically successful treatment of FRI of long bones, patients report significantly lower quality of life in comparison to normative data. Future clinical studies on FRIs should focus on patient-related outcome measures enabling best possible shared treatment decision-making.

There is serologic evidence suggesting widespread exposure of humans to PVM. To investigate replication in primates, African green monkeys (AGM) and rhesus macaques (n = 4) were inoculated with PVM by the respiratory route. Virus was shed intermittently at low levels by a subset of animals, suggesting poor permissiveness. PVM efficiently replicated in cultured human cells and inhibited the type I interferon (IFN) response in these cells. This suggests that poor replication in nonhuman primates was not due to a general nonpermissiveness of primate cells or poor control of the IFN response. Seroprevalence in humans was examined by screening sera from 30 adults and 17 young children for PVM-neutralizing activity. Sera from a single child (6%) and 40% of adults had low neutralizing activity against PVM, which could be consistent with increasing incidence of exposure following early childhood. There was no cross-reaction of human or AGM sera between RSV and PVM and no cross-protection in the mouse model. In native Western blots, human sera reacted with RSV but not PVM proteins under conditions in which AGM immune sera reacted strongly. Serum reactivity was further evaluated by flow cytometry using unfixed Vero cells infected with PVM or RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a measure of viral gene expression. The reactivity of human sera against RSV-infected cells correlated with GFP expression, whereas reactivity against PVM-infected cells was low and uncorrelated with GFP expression. Thus, PVM specificity was not evident. Our results indicate that the PVM-neutralizing activity of human sera is not due to RSV- or PVM-specific antibodies but may be due to low-affinity, polyreactive natural antibodies of the IgG subclass. The absence of PVM-specific antibodies and restriction in nonhuman primates makes PVM unlikely to be a human pathogen.","output":"Evaluation of pneumonia virus of mice as a possible human pathogen."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accumulated evidence indicates that patients with lung cancer are a vulnerable population throughout the pandemic. Limited information is available in Latin America regarding the impact of the pandemic on medical care. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and social effect of COVID\\\\19 on patients with thoracic cancer and to ascertain outcomes in those with a confirmed diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included patients with thoracic neoplasms within a single institution between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021. All variables of interest were extracted from electronic medical records. During this period, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS\\\\2) was applied to evaluate and identify more common psychological disorders. RESULTS: The mean age for the total cohort (n = 548) was 61.5  12.9 years; non\\\\small cell lung cancer was the most frequent neoplasm (86.9%), advanced stages predominated (80%), and most patients were under active therapy (82.8%). Any change in treatment was reported in 23.9% of patients, of which 78.6% were due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Treatment delays (7 days) were the most frequent modifications in 41.9% of cases, followed by treatment suspension at 37.4%. Patients without treatment changes had a more prolonged progression\\\\free survival and overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.21, p < .001 and HR 0.28, p < .001, respectively). The mean DASS\\\\21 score was 10.45 in 144 evaluated patients, with women being more affected than men (11.41 vs. 9.08, p < .001). Anxiety was reported in 30.5% of cases, followed by depression and distress in equal proportions (18%). Depressed and stressed patients had higher odds of experiencing delays in treatment than patients without depression (odds ratio [OR] 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53C13.23, p = .006 and OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.2C10.06, p = .006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Treatment adjustments in patients with thoracic malignancies often occurred to avoid COVID\\\\19 contagion with detrimental effects on survival. Psychological disorders could have a role in adherence to the original treatment regimen. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The pandemic has placed an enormous strain on health care systems globally. Patients with thoracic cancers represent a vulnerable population, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. In Mexico, treatment modifications were common during the pandemic, and those who experienced delays had worse survival outcomes. Most treatment modifications were related to a patient decision rather than a lockdown of health care facilities in which mental health impairment plays an essential role.

Since COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, several drug regimens have rapidly undergone clinical trials for the management of COVID-19. However, one of the major issues is drug-induced organ injury, which is a prominent clinical challenge. Unfortunately, most drugs used against COVID-19 are associated with adverse effects in different organs, such as the kidney, heart, and liver. These side effects are dangerous and, in some cases, they can be lethal. More importantly, organ injury is also a clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. These adverse reactions are increasingly recognized as outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of drug-induced adverse effects from COVID-19-induced organ injury is a clinical complication.

Fewer pretreatment steps correspond to lower chances of infection. The authors established a direct injection technique to analyze levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations in human serum and studied its application in therapeutic drug monitoring. METHODS: Serum samples were prepared by hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration and the filtrate was directly injected into a UHPLC apparatus (Waters UPLC BEH C18 column: 50 mm  2.1 mm, 1.7 m) for analysis. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (8:92) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 30C. The detected wavelength was 210 nm. RESULTS: A linear relationship was obtained for LEV from 0.625 to 80 g/mL (r = 0.999). The limit of detection (LOD) for the analysis of LEV was 0.125 g/mL. The analysis time was shortened to 4 min. The recovery rate of LEV based on the current method was 96.6-100.1%, whereas the absolute recovery rate was 93.2-96.8%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday and interday precision was <7.3%. Stability was achieved at room temperature for 24 hr after 3 freeze-thaw cycles and at -80 C for 21 days. The method was successfully applied to determine LEV concentrations in the serum of 19 patients. CONCLUSION: The present method is simple, accurate, and sensitive and can improve biosafety with the direct injection technique.

Several sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) ligands have been demonstrated to regulate the seizure threshold in acute and chronic seizure models. However, the mechanism by which Sig1R modulates the excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the brain has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility to seizures of wild type (WT) and Sig1R knockout (Sig1R-/-) mice in intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and (+)-bicuculline (BIC) infusion-induced acute seizure and Sig1R antagonist NE-100-induced seizure models. To determine possible molecular mechanisms, we used quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to assess the possible involvement of several seizure-related genes and proteins. Peripheral tissue contractile response of WT and Sig1R-/- mice was studied in an isolated vasa deferentia model. The most important finding was the significantly decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor in the hippocampus and habenula of Sig1R-/- mice. Our results demonstrated that Sig1R-/- mice have decreased thresholds for PTZ- and BIC-induced tonic seizures. In the NE-100-induced seizure model, Sig1R-/- animals demonstrated lower seizure scores, shorter durations and increased latency times of seizures compared to WT mice. Sig1R-independent activities of NE-100 included downregulation of the gene expression of iNOS and GABA-A 2 and inhibition of KCl-induced depolarization in both WT and Sig1R-/- animals. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the lack of Sig1R resulted in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures. Our results confirm that Sig1R is a significant molecular target for seizure modulation and warrants further investigation for the development of novel anti-seizure drugs.","output":"Genetic inactivation of the sigma-1 chaperone protein results in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a powerful reporter protein that allows labeling of specific proteins or entire cells. However, as GFP is a small soluble protein, it easily crosses membranes if cell integrity is disrupted, and GFP signal is lost or diffuse if the specimen is not fixed beforehand.

To be able to use GFP labeling in tissues prepared for such applications, we have tested various protocols to minimize the loss of GFP signal. Here we show that, in cryocut sections of snap-frozen brain tissue from two GFP reporter mouse lines, leaking of the GFP signal is prevented by omitting the commonly performed drying of the cryosections, and by direct post-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde pre-warmed at 30-37 C. Although the GFP staining does not reach the same quality as obtained with pre-fixed tissue, GFP localization within the cells that express it is preserved with this method.

Participants were excluded if they were a health care professional or had been tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 (16.0%) were excluded prior to completing the survey, 13 (0.7%) declined, and 1500 (83.2%) participated in the survey. Of the 1500 survey participants, 37.3% (n=560) had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 18.7% (n=280) intended to do so, 27.7% (n=416) refused to do so, and 16.3% (n=244) were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (165/660, 25.0%) and technical concerns (159/660, 24.1%). Other reasons included the belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app was unnecessary (111/660, 16.8%), distrust in the government (73/660, 11.1%), and other miscellaneous responses (eg, apathy and following the decisions of others) (73/660, 11.1%).

Nonetheless, since its introduction in human populations, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 must have been subject to the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high\\\\quality SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than nonepitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses and for sarbecoviruses sampled in bats. Conversely, in the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 population, epitopes for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were not more variable than nonepitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8 and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 evolves to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells is not actively avoided by the virus. However, we also found a trend of lower diversity of T cell epitopes for common cold coronaviruses, indicating that epitope conservation per se is not directly linked to disease severity. We suggest that conservation serves to maintain epitopes that elicit tolerizing T cell responses or induce T cells with regulatory activity.","output":"Antigenic variation of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in response to immune pressure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in pediatrics worldwide.

There is no effective treatment against this disease. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA and the main protease (Mpro) has a role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, and thus these two enzymes are strong candidates for targeting by anti-viral drugs. Small molecules such as lopinavir and favipiravir significantly inhibit the activity of Mpro and RdRp in vitro. Studies have shown that structurally modified lopinavir, favipiravir, and other similar compounds can inhibit COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this study, lopinavir and its structurally similar compounds were chosen to bind the main protease, and favipiravir was chosen to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Molecular docking and the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study revealed that the selected candidates have favorable binding affinity but less druggable properties. To improve the druggability, four structural analogues of lopinavir and one structural analogue of favipiravir was designed by structural modification. Molecular interaction analyses have displayed that lopinavir and favipiravir analogues interact with the active site residues of Mpro and RdRp, respectively. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties, medicinal chemistry profile, and physicochemical features were shown that all structurally modified analogues are less toxic and contain high druggable properties than the selected candidates. Subsequently, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four docked complexes demonstrated that CID44271905, a lopinavir analogue, forms the most stable complex with the Mpro. Further MMPBSA analyses using the MD trajectories also confirmed the higher binding affinity of CID44271905 towards Mpro.

However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm.

Among the analyzed complexes, azurin docked relatively well with the S2 domain of S-protein compared to the other viral proteins. The derived peptide p18 bound to the active site domain of the PLpro protein; however, in other complexes, lesser interactions were recorded. The second azurin derived peptide p28, fared the best among the docked proteins. p28 interacted with all the three viral proteins and the host ACE-2 receptor by forming several electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with the S-protein, 3CLpro, and PLpro.

Government-mandated restrictions on free movement affected individuals engagement with physical activity, with reported increases leading to biopsychosocial health benefits and conversely increased sedentary behaviour leading to poorer health. Good foot health is key to enabling physical activity and maximal participation in activities of occupation and daily living. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was performed, using a web-based platform. Quantitative and qualitative data were captured through responses to closed and open survey questions. Anybody with a foot health condition was eligible to participate in the online survey. Links were sent through professional networks, support groups and charities, using a snowball strategy to maximise participation. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five respondents completed the survey. Most (n = 193, 75.69%) reported an ongoing foot pain or problem that had been present for 4 weeks or longer, whilst 49 respondents (19.22%) noted a new pain or problem. Pain was the most frequently reported symptom (n = 139, 54.51%), whilst change in appearance of the foot was also commonly reported (n = 122, 47.84%), often alongside the observable presence of swelling. Musculoskeletal foot symptoms were frequently reported (n = 123, 48%), and were significantly associated with reported reduced physical activity (X(2) = 6.61, p = 0.010). Following qualitative analysis five themes and 11 subthemes emerged, informed by 49 independent codes.

The median time to clinical improvement was 26 days (IQR 15-not reached (n.r.)) in the CCP group and 66 days (IQR 13-n.r.) in the control group (p=0.27). Median time to discharge from hospital was 31 days (IQR 16-n.r.) in the CCP and 51 days (IQR 20-n.r.) in the control group (p=0.24). In the subgroup that received a higher cumulative amount of neutralizing antibodies the primary outcome occurred in 56.0% (versus 32.1%), with a shorter interval to clinical improvement, shorter time to hospital discharge and better survival compared to the control group. Conclusion: CCP added to standard treatment did not result in a significant difference in the primary and secondary outcomes. A pre-defined subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit for CCP among those who received a larger amount of neutralizing antibodies.

There is now extensive literature on its presentation and initial management. There is no literature however on what happens to these patients following discharge. Methods: We collected clinical data and samples from seven patients presenting with VITT and followed them up for 82-145 days. We also collected clinical samples from them at last follow-up. Testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies was done using an anti-PF4/heparin enzymatic immunoassay. Flow Cytometry was used to look at Fc{gamma}RIIa levels on patient platelets. Light Transmission Aggregometry with patient serum and healthy donor / patient platelets was used to analyse platelet responsiveness, in the presence and absence of PF4. Findings: All patients were discharged on direct oral anticoagulants. Two patients remain completely symptom free, three have ongoing headaches, two have residual neurological deficits. Two patients developed mild thrombocytopenia and worsening headache (but without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and were retreated, one of these with rituximab. All patients, except the one treated with rituximab, had similar anti-PF4 antibody titres at 80-120 days to their levels at diagnosis. Platelets from patients at follow-up had normal levels of Fc{gamma}RIIa and had normal responses to thrombin and collagen-related-peptide. Patient serum from diagnosis strongly activated healthy donor platelets in the presence of PF4. Serum from follow-up was much weaker at stimulating platelets, even in the presence of PF4. Interpretation: This study shows that despite similar PF4 antibody titres at diagnosis and during follow-up, there are further differences in patient serum, that are not apparent from currently used testing, that result in lower levels of platelet activation during the follow-up period. Further understanding of these factors are important in order to assess duration of anticoagulation for these patients.","output":"Anti-PF4 levels of patients with VITT do not reduce 4 months following AZD1222 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction COVID-19 affects the hematologic system. This article evaluated the impact of hematologic involvement of different blood cell line parameters of white blood cells including absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin, and platelets in COVID-19 patients and their association with hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS). Methods This was a retrospective study of 475 patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection and hematologic abnormalities in the metropolitan New York City area. Results Elevated absolute neutrophil count (OR: 1.20;95% CI: 1.02C1.42;p < 0.05) increased days of hematologic involvement (OR: 4.44;95% CI: 1.42C13.90;p < 0.05), and persistence of hematologic involvement at discharge (OR: 2.87;95% CI: 1.20C6.90;p < 0.05) was associated with higher mortality.

This complexity must be addressed by a multidisciplinary team, and an inflammatory bowel disease nurse can be the ideal professional figure to create a link between doctor and patient. The objective of this comprehensive review is to describe the figure of inflammatory bowel disease nurses and the various benefits that their introduction into a multidisciplinary team can bring, as well as a focus on how to become an inflammatory bowel disease nurse. Materials and Methods: A search on the PubMed database was performed by associating the terms IBD or inflammatory bowel disease with the Boolean term AND to the various issues addressed: life impact, communication, fistulas, ostomy, diet, incontinence, sexuality, parenthood, fatigue, pain management, and follow up appointments. Regarding the analysis of the benefits that the IBD nurse brings, the terms IBD, inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohns disease, and ulcerative colitis were used, associating them with the terms benefit, costs, team, and patients. Finally, regarding the focus on how to become an IBD nurse, an IBD nurse was interviewed. Results: An IBD nurse is a valuable nursing figure within the multidisciplinary team that takes care of patients with IBD because this nurse performs important functions from both a clinical assistance point of view (management of fistulas, ostomies, infusion of biological drugs) and an information and therapeutic education point of view (communication with patients, direct contact with patients by telephone or email). Furthermore, this nurse performs the filter function between doctor and patient, saving time for doctors that will be used for more outpatient visits. Conclusions: The introduction of an inflammatory bowel disease nurse is therefore recommended for multidisciplinary organizations dealing with the clinical course of patients suffering from IBD.","output":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease NursePractical Messages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) initiated shocks to the Canadian agri\\\\food industry moving the sector away from its prepandemic equilibrium.

As the medical community seeks better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19, several theories have been proposed. One widely shared theory suggests that SARS-CoV-2 proteins directly interact with human hemoglobin (Hb) and facilitate removal of iron from the heme prosthetic group, leading to the loss of functional hemoglobin and accumulation of iron. Herein, we refute this theory. We compared clinical data from 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients to 21 non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient controls, generating hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curves from venous blood gases. This curve generated from the COVID-19 cohort matched the idealized oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve well (Pearson correlation R2=0.97, P<0.0001; a coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square deviation [CV(RMSD)] =7.3%). We further analyzed hemoglobin, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, iron, ferritin, and haptoglobin levels. For all analyzed parameters, patients with COVID-19 had similar levels compared to patients with ARDS without COVID-19. These results indicate that patients with COVID-19 do not exhibit any hemolytic anemia or a shift in the normal hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. We therefore conclude that COVID-19 does not impact oxygen delivery through a mechanism involving red cell hemolysis and subsequent removal of iron from the heme prosthetic group in hemoglobin.","output":"No evidence of hemoglobin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most viruses use several entry sites and modes of transmission to infect their host (parenteral, sexual, respiratory, oro-fecal, transplacental, transcutaneous, etc.).

Personal health records (PHRs) are suitable for the daily management of physical conditions. Importantly, there are no major differences between the items collected by daily health observation via PHR and the observation of items related to COVID-19. Until now, observations related to COVID-19 have been performed exclusively based on disease-specific items. Therefore, we hypothesize that PHRs would be suitable as a symptom-tracking tool for COVID-19. To this end, we integrated health observation items specific to COVID-19 with an existing PHR-based app. OBJECTIVE: This study is conducted as a proof-of-concept study in a real-world setting to develop a PHR-based COVID-19 symptom-tracking app and to demonstrate the practical use of health observations for COVID-19 using a smartphone or tablet app integrated with PHRs. METHODS: We applied the PHR-based health observation app within an active epidemiological investigation conducted by Wakayama City Public Health Center. At the public health center, a list is made of individuals who have been in close contact with known infected cases (health observers). Email addresses are used by the app when a health observer sends data to the public health center. Each health observer downloads the app and installs it on their smartphone. Self-observed health data are entered daily into the app. These data are then sent via the app by email at a designated time. Localized epidemiological officers can visualize the collected data using a spreadsheet macro and, thus, monitor the health condition of all health observers. RESULTS: We used the app as part of an active epidemiological investigation executed at a public health center. During the investigation, 72 close contacts were discovered. Among them, 57 had adopted the use of the health observation app. Before the introduction of the app, all health observers would have been interviewed by telephone, a slow process that took four epidemiological officers more than 2 hours. After the introduction of the app, a single epidemiological officer can carry out health observations. The app was distributed for free beginning in early March, and by mid-May, it had been used by more than 20,280 users and 400 facilities and organizations across Japan. Currently, health observation of COVID-19 is socially recognized and has become one of the requirements for resuming social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Health observation by PHRs for the purpose of improving health management can also be effectively applied as a measure against large-scale infectious diseases. Individual habits of improving awareness of personal health and the use of PHRs for daily health management are powerful armaments against the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Ultimately, similar actions may help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Health Observation App for COVID-19 Symptom Tracking Integrated With Personal Health Records: Proof of Concept and Practical Use Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of specific treatment and the urgent situation requires use of all resources to remedy this scourge In the present study, using molecular docking, we identify new probable inhibitors of COVID-19 by molecules from Nigella sativa L , which is highly reputed healing herin North African societies and both Islamic and Christian traditions The discovery of the M supro /suprotease structure in COVID-19 provides a great opportunity to identify potential drug candidates for treatment Focusing on the main proteases in CoVs (3CL supro /su/M supro /su) (PDID 6LU7 and 2GTB);docking of compounds from Nigella Sativa and drugs under clinical test was performed using Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE) Nigelledine docked into 6LU7 active site gives energy complex about -6 29734373 Kcal/mol which is close to the energy score given by chloroquine (-6 2930522 Kcal/mol) and better than energy score given by hydroxychloroquine (-5 57386112 Kcal/mol) and favipiravir (-4 23310471 kcal/mol) Docking into 2GTactive site showed that ?- Hederin gives energy score about-6 50204802 kcal/mol whcih is better energy score given by chloroquine (-6 20844936 kcal/mol), hydroxychloroquine (-5 51465893 kcal/mol)) and favipiravir (-4 12183571kcal/mol) Nigellidine and ?- Hederin appeared to have the best potential to act as COVID-19 treatment Further, researches are necessary to testify medicinal use of identified and to encourage preventive use of Nigella Sativa against coronavirus infection","output":"Identification of Compounds from Nigella Sativa as New Potential Inhibitors of 2019 Novel Coronasvirus (Covid-19): Molecular Docking Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) and associated COVID\\\\19 disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to effectively combat the outbreak.

AR experiences consist of the enhancement of real-world environments by superimposing additional layers of information, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. Pervasive AR extends this concept through experiences that are continuous in space, being aware of and responsive to the users context and pose. Currently, the time and technical expertise required to create such applications are the main reasons preventing its widespread use. As such, authoring tools which facilitate the development and configuration of pervasive AR experiences have become progressively more relevant. Their operation often involves the navigation of the real-world scene and the use of the AR equipment itself to add the augmented information within the environment. The proposed experimental tool makes use of 3D scans from physical environments to provide a reconstructed digital replica of such spaces for a desktop-based method, and to enable positional tracking for a mobile-based one. While the desktop platform represents a non-immersive setting, the mobile one provides continuous AR in the physical environment. Both versions can be used to place virtual content and ultimately configure an AR experience. The authoring capabilities of the different platforms were compared by conducting a user study focused on evaluating their usability. Although the AR interface was generally considered more intuitive, the desktop platform shows promise in several aspects, such as remote configuration, lower required effort, and overall better scalability.","output":"Comparing Desktop vs. Mobile Interaction for the Creation of Pervasive Augmented Reality Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in collective accommodation centres is crucial to maintain the physical and mental health of refugees It is unclear what measures have been taken by authorities in this setting to reduce the risk of infection, minimise stressors for refugees during the pandemic and communicate containment measures OBJECTIVES: Assessment of measures that have been taken to prevent and contain SARS-CoV-2 in collective accommodation for refugees and identification of support required by authorities METHODS: Qualitative interview study with 48 representatives responsible for the reception and accommodation of refugees Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using framework analysis RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoV-2 and quarantine positive cases Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts CONCLUSION: Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so In order to further contain the pandemic, a strengthening of centralised, setting-specific recommendations and information as well as their translation through the pro-active involvement of the public health authorities at the local level are essential","output":"[COVID-19 in collective accommodation centres for refugees: assessment of pandemic control measures and priorities from the perspective of authorities]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Critical hypoxia in this COVID-19 pandemic results in high mortality and economic loss worldwide.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included the subjects who had received both doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 2020 and February 2021. We asked about the side effects after the first and the second vaccine doses. One group had no history of COVID-19, and the second had a history of COVID-19. ANTI-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured by the immunodetection technique in the second group only. RESULTS: We included 946 participants, 62% were women, and 80% were without comorbidities; 680 were included in the first group, and only 266 were in the second group. After the first dose, 77% of the first group and 86% of the second group presented some side effects.

There is still no consensus on whether solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients with COVID-19 are at greater risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between SOT, severe COVID-19 illness, and mortality. METHODS: A systemically comprehensive search in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was performed for relevant studies and articles. Consequently, we pooled the odds ratio (OR) from individual studies and performed heterogeneity, quality assessment and subgroup/sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 15 articles with 265,839 participants were included in this study. Among the total number of participants, 1485 were SOT recipients. The meta-analysis results showed that transplant patients with COVID-19 were remarkably associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission than non-transplant patients (ORa?=a?1.57, 95%CI: 1.07 to 2.31, Pa?=a?0.02). On the other hand, there were no statistically significant differences between SOT recipients and non-SOT recipients in mechanical ventilation need (ORa?=a?1.55, 95%CI: 0.98 to 2.44, Pa?=a?0.06). In addition, we found that SOT recipients with COVID-19 had 1.40-fold increased odds of mortality than non-SOT recipients (ORa?=a?1.40, 95%CI: 1.10 to 1.79, Pa?=a?0.007). Moreover, pooled analysis of adjusted results revealed that SOT recipients had a greater risk of mortality compared with non-SOT patients (HRa?=a?1.54, 95%CI: 1.03 to 2.32, Pa?=a?0.037). LIMITATIONS: The main limitations in our study are attributed to the relatively small sample size, short follow-up period, and the fact that most of the studies included were retrospective in design.

Here, we review the literature to date of the short-term and long-term consequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the heart. RECENT FINDINGS: Early case reports described a spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. However, in most cases, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears to be predominantly mediated by the severity of critical illness rather than direct injury to myocardium from viral particles. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains a powerful tool for diagnosing acute myocarditis, it should be used judiciously in light of low baseline prevalence of myocarditis. Guiding an athletic patient through return to play (RTP) after COVID-19 infection is a challenging process. More recent data show RTP has been a safe endeavor using a screening protocol. \\"Long COVID\\" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been described. The reported symptoms span a large breadth of cardiopulmonary and neurologic complaints including fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, brain fog, and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Management of POTS/dysautonomia primarily centers on education, exercise, and salt and fluid repletion. Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is constantly evolving. As we enter a new age of survivorship, additional research is needed to catalogue the burden of persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms. Research is also needed to learn how acute management may alter the likelihood and prevalence of this chronic syndrome.","output":"COVID and Cardiovascular Disease: What We Know in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study was designed to evaluate overall survival after radioembolization or best supportive care (BSC) in patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS This was a matched-pair comparison of patients who received radioembolization plus BSC or BSC alone for extensive liver disease. Twenty-nine patients who received radioembolization were retrospectively matched with a contemporary cohort of >500 patients who received BSC from 3 centers in Germany. Using clinical databases, patients were initially matched for prior treatments and tumor burden and then 29 patients were consecutively identified with two or more of four matching criteria: synchronous/metachronous metastases, tumor burden, increased ALP, and/or CEA >200 U/ml. Survival was calculated from date of progression before radioembolization or BSC by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS Of 29 patients in each study arm, 16 pairs (55.2%) matched for all four criteria, and 11 pairs (37.9%) matched three criteria. Patients in both groups had a similar performance status (Karnofsky index, median 80% [range, 60-100%]). Compared with BSC alone, radioembolization prolonged survival (median, 8.3 vs. 3.5 months; P < 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.55; P < 0.001) in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Treatment-related adverse events following radioembolization included: grade 1-2 fatigue (n = 20, 69%), grade 1 abdominal pain/nausea (n = 14, 48.3%), and grade 2 gastrointestinal ulceration (n = 3, 10.3%). Three cases of grade 3 radiation-induced liver disease were symptomatically managed. CONCLUSIONS Radioembolization offers a promising addition to BSC in treatment-refractory patients for whom there are limited options.

METHODS: We report 11 cases of patients with COVID-19 from five Swiss hospitals that illustrate the various indications for physical therapy, clinical challenges, potential treatment methods and short-term response to treatment. RESULTS: Physical therapists actively treated patients with COVID-19 on wards and in the ICU. Interventions ranged from patient education, to prone positioning, to early mobilization and respiratory therapy. Patients were often unstable with quick exacerbation of symptoms and a slow and fluctuant recovery. Additionally, many patients who are critically ill developed severe weakness, post-extubation dysphagia, weaning failure or presented with anxiety or delirium. In this setting, physical therapy was challenging and required specialized and individualized therapeutic strategies. Most patients adopted the proposed treatment strategies and lung function and physical strength improved over time. CONCLUSION: Physical therapists clearly have a role in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate the duration of CD in patients with sudden subjective olfactory and/or gustatory loss during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The secondary aim was to identify possible prognostic factors for the duration of CD. METHODS: An online baseline questionnaire was designed to assess subjective CD. Three rounds of follow-up questionnaires were sent out to any participants with persistent CD in 6-week intervals, prospectively assessing subjective chemosensory function and extending the follow-up time of this cohort significantly. RESULTS: In total, 467 participants completed the baseline questionnaire. The most significant improvement and recovery of chemosensory function was observed within the first month after the initial loss. Rates became stagnant after about 2 months, and only little improvement and recovery was seen after 2C4 months. After a mean follow-up of 95.9 days (olfactory dysfunction) and 94.0 days (gustatory dysfunction), 86.7% of participants reported gustatory improvement and 82.6% reported olfactory improvement, while 55.0% reported full gustatory recovery and 43.8% reported full olfactory recovery. Female gender was associated with better improvement of gustatory function. High subjective severity of chemosensory loss was associated with lower rates of olfactory and gustatory recovery as well as improvement of olfactory function. Young age was not associated with a better prognosis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Rates of improvement and recovery of chemosensory function decreased after 2C4 months after initial chemosensory loss, possibly indicating that prolonged and perhaps permanent chemosensory loss may be a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for pelvic girdle pain measure different outcomes, making it difficult to pool data in meta-analysis in a meaningful and interpretable way to increase the certainty of effect measures. A consensus-based core outcome set for pelvic girdle pain can address this issue. As a first step in developing a core outcome set, it is essential to systematically examine the outcomes measured in existing studies. Objective The objective of this systematic review was to identify, examine and compare what outcomes are measured and reported, and how outcomes are measured, in intervention studies and systematic reviews of interventions for pelvic girdle pain and for lumbopelvic pain (which includes pelvic girdle pain). Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro and Embase from inception to the 11th May 2018. Two reviewers independently selected studies by title/abstract and by full text screening. Disagreement was resolved through discussion. Outcomes reported and their outcome measurement instruments were extracted and recorded by two reviewers independently. We assessed the quality of reporting with two independent reviewers. The outcomes were grouped into core domains using the OMERACT filter 2.0 framework. Results A total of 107 studies were included, including 33 studies on pelvic girdle pain and 74 studies on lumbopelvic pain. Forty-six outcomes were reported across all studies, with the highest amount (26/46) in the 'life impact' domain. 'Pain' was the most commonly reported outcome in both pelvic girdle pain and lumbopelvic pain studies. Studies used different instruments to measure the same outcomes, particularly for the outcomes pain, function, disability and quality of life. Conclusions A wide variety of outcomes and outcome measurements are used in studies on pelvic girdle pain and lumbopelvic pain. The findings of this review will be included in a Delphi survey to reach consensus on a pelvic girdle pain - core outcome set. This core outcome set will allow for more effective comparison between future studies on pelvic girdle pain, allowing for more effective translation of findings to clinical practice.

For each patient, we categorized arterial wall thickening and enhancement as definite, possible, or none using contralateral arteries as a reference standard. We performed (2) tests to compare the effects of medical therapy and mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Sixteen patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Median time from symptom onset to VW-MRI was 3 days (interquartile range, 2 days). Among 6 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever, VW-MRI demonstrated definite arterial wall thickening in 5 (83%) and possible thickening in 1 (17%); there was definite wall enhancement in 4 (67%) and possible enhancement in 2 (33%). Among 10 patients treated with medical therapy alone, VW-MRI demonstrated definite arterial wall thickening in 3 (30%) and possible thickening in 2 (20%); there was definite wall enhancement in 2 (20%) and possible enhancement in 2 (20%). Arterial wall thickening and enhancement were more common in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy than with medical therapy alone (P=0.037 and P=0.016, respectively).

Overall, 70 articles were included in the narrative synthesis. A total of 102 unique cadres names were identified from 36 LMIC countries. Of the cadres included, 16% represented doctors, 16% were nurses, and 15% were midwives. We found substantial heterogeneity between and within countries on the reported definition of SBA and the education, training, skills and competencies that they were able to perform. CONCLUSION The uncertainty and diversity of reported qualifications and competency of SBA within and between countries requires attention in order to better ascertain strategic priorities for future health system planning, including training and education. These results can inform recommendations around improved coverage measurement and monitoring of SBA moving forward, allowing for more accurate, consistent, and timely data able to guide decisions and action around planning and implementation of maternal and newborn health programmes.","output":"Scoping review to identify and map the health personnel considered skilled birth attendants in low-and-middle income countries from 2000-2015."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) suggest a protective effect of anti-A antibodies against viral cell entry that may hold relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The ENT block internship at the University Hospital Dresden was offered fully digital for the first time in summer semester 2020. The focus was on teaching and assessing psychomotor skills of ENT mirror examination. Methods 241 students were provided with a digital script, instructional videos about the standardized ENT mirror examination and a disposable ENT instrument set. 188 students also received a one-hour real-time teleteaching session with an ENT physician. 53 students received no teleteaching. The students had to submit a video of their standardized mirror examination and specify their individual practice time. The videos were evaluated using a checklist-based assessment (maximum 100 points). Results The average total score of all students is 86,10,09. Students with teleteaching achieve significantly (p=0,005) higher scores (87,00,09) than students without teleteaching (830,11). There is a positive and significant correlation between practice time and total score in the group with teleteaching. Conclusion Real-time teleteaching (digital presence teaching) has a significant influence on the psychomotor learning curves of students. A checklist-based evaluation is indispensable for establishing a digital assessment of psychomotor skills and for creating comparability between analog and digital teaching. Previous analyses showed that after the analog mirror course with 6 teaching units (45 min each) an average of 95.4 points was achieved.

Methods: Data were collected from 2004 individuals through an online survey conducted 6 to 8 weeks after the first lockdown in France. Participants were asked whether they supported eight COVID-19 preventive measures. COVID-19-related perceptions were also assessed using an adapted version of Wittes Extended Parallel Process Model, together with sociodemographic and environmental variables. Results: Acceptance rate reached 86.1 % for individual protective measures, such as make mask mandatory in public open space, and 70.0% for collective restrictions, such as isolating the most vulnerable people (80%) or forbidding public gatherings (79.3%). The least popular restrictions were closing all schools/universities and non-essential commerce such as bars and restaurants (57.2%). Acceptance of collective restrictions was positively associated with their perceived efficacy, fear, and perceived severity of COVID-19, and negatively with age older than 60 years. Acceptance of individual protective measures was associated with their perceived efficacy, fear, and perceived severity of COVID-19.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic people is thought to be the underlying cause of a large proportion of new infections. However, the local prevalence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by local public health restrictions and the community setting. Objectives: This study has three main objectives. First, we looked to establish the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection on a university campus in California. Second, we sought to assess the changes in viral prevalence associated with the shifting community conditions related to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Third, we aimed to compare the performance of CRISPR- and PCR-based assays for large-scale virus surveillance sampling in COVID-19 asymptomatic persons. Methods: We enrolled 1,808 asymptomatic persons for self-collection of oropharyngeal (OP) samples to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing. We compared viral prevalence in samples obtained in two time periods: May 28th-June 11th; June 23rd-July 2nd. We detected viral genomes in these samples using two assays: CREST, a CRISPR-based method recently developed at UCSB, and the RT-qPCR test recommended by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 1,808 participants, 1,805 were affiliates of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 1,306 were students. None of the tests performed on the 732 samples collected between late May to early June were positive. In contrast, tests performed on the 1076 samples collected between late June to early July, revealed nine positive cases. This change in prevalence met statistical significance, p = 0.013. One sample was positive by RT-qPCR at the threshold of detection, but negative by both CREST and CLIA-confirmation testing. With this single exception, there was perfect concordance in both positive and negative results obtained by RT-qPCR and CREST. The estimated prevalence of the virus, calculated using the confirmed cases, was 0.74%. The average age of our sample population was 28.33 (18-75) years, and the average age of the positive cases was 21.7 years (19-30). Conclusions: Our study revealed that there were no COVID-19 cases in our study population in May/June. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in community restrictions and public interactions. This increase in prevalence, in a young and asymptomatic population which would not have otherwise accessed COVID-19 testing, indicated the leading wave of a local outbreak, and coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. Our results substantiate that large, population-level asymptomatic screening using self-collection may be a feasible and instructive aspect of the public health approach within large campus communities, and the almost perfect concordance between CRISPR- and PCR-based assays indicate expanded options for surveillance testing","output":"CRISPR-based and RT-qPCR surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals uncovers a shift in viral prevalence among a university population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), a single-stranded RNA virus, was found to be the causal agent of the disease called coronavirus disease.

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17C45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34C58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24C65% (and peak deaths 15C69%), compared to 2C9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9C18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","output":"To mask or not to mask: Modeling the potential for face mask use by the general public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir (RDV) has garnered much hope for its moderate anti-COVID-19 effects, but its limited amelioration of survival in hospitalized patient causes a huge controversy over the applicability of RDV to COVID-19 treatment. Developing strategies to improve its antivirus efficacy is urgently required. As anticipated, RDV exhibits similar behavior with other nucleotide analogs to disrupt the metabolism of natural endogenous ribonucleotides (RNs) and deoxyribonucleotides (dRNs). Alterations in endogenous RNs and dRNs play a critical role in virus replication as well as other key cellular functions. Thus elucidation of the disturbances of RDV on RNs and dRNs could help to understand its exact mechanism of action. Here, the metabolic profiling determined by liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry method showed a general increase in the abundance of nucleotides and a more than 2-fold increase for specific nucleotides. However, the variation of pyrimidine ribonucleotides was relative slight or even contrary, resulting in obvious imbalance between purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotides, which implied the obstacle of RDV to pyrimidine synthesis and could further block the transcription and replication of viral RNA. Additionally, the extreme disequilibrium between cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and cytidine monophosphate might result from the inhibition of CTP synthase and provide a metabolic target for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Since nucleotides metabolism pathways are vulnerable to nucleotide analogues and are liable to be the regulation targets, it is promising to enhance the efficacy of RDV through co-administration with CTP synthase inhibitors or de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors to exacerbate the imbalance of nucleotide pools.","output":"Profiling Ribonucleotide and Deoxyribonucleotide Pools Perturbed by Remdesivir in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has tested people's coping and resilience.

Findings suggest that high levels of neuroticism constitute a risk for pandemic-induced distress and poor overall coping. People with prominent extraversion, conscientiousness or agreeableness have generally demonstrated a good adjustment to the pandemic, including compliance with containment and mitigation measures imposed by the authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19. A few studies of individuals with borderline personality disorder identified social isolation as the most destabilising factor for them. Poor compliance with containment and mitigation measures has been strongly associated with various antisocial personality traits.

There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms.

Many studies have shown that several laboratory parameters are related to disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 cases. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship of a prognostic factor, D-dimer, with disease severity, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: A systematic search for all observational studies and trials involving adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 that had any data related to D-dimer on admission was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD) of D-dimer values for outcomes such as disease severity, mortality, and need for ICU care. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (4,328 patients) were included in this meta-analysis, which revealed a higher mean of D-dimer levels on admission in severe patients than in nonsevere patients (MD = 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.28], P < .05; I2 = 90%).

It is frequently assumed that digital technologies can supplement and perhaps even replace services for families. This is challenging in conditions of high device and data costs as well as poor internet provision and access, raising concerns about widening inequalities in availability of support and consequent effects on child and family outcomes. Very few studies have examined these issues, including in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were twofold, the first was to gather data on the impact of COVID-19 on families of young children using an online survey. The second was to assess the feasibility of using a data-free online platform to conduct regular surveys and, potentially, to provide support for parents and families of young children in South Africa. METHODS: We used a data-free mobile messenger platform to conduct a short digital survey of the impact of COVID-19 on caring for young children in South Africa. We report on the methodological processes and preliminary findings of the online survey. RESULTS: More than 44,000 individuals accessed the survey link and 16,217 consented to the short survey within 96 hours of it being launched. Respondents were predominantly from lower- and lower-middle classes, representing the majority of the population, with urban residential locations roughly proportionate to national patterns, and some under-representation of rural households. Mothers comprised 70% of respondents and fathers 30%, representing 18,672 children 5 years and younger. Response rates per survey item ranged from 75% at the start of the survey to 50% at completion. Eighty-two percent of parents experienced at least one challenge during the pandemic and 53% did not receive help when needed from listed sources. Aggregate and individual findings in the form of bar graphs were made available to participants to view and download once they had completed the survey. Participants were also able to download contact details for support and referral services at no data cost. CONCLUSIONS: Data-free survey methodology breaks new ground and demonstrates potential not previously considered. Reach is greater than achieved through phone surveys and some social media platforms, men are not usually included in parent surveys, costs are lower than phone surveys, and the technology allows for immediate feedback to respondents. These factors suggest that zero-rated services could provide a feasible, sustainable and equitable basis for ongoing interactions with families of young children.","output":"Bridging the digital divide with data-free platforms: Online survey reaching families with young children during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exacerbates major risk factors for global human trafficking.

Both educational attainment and health behaviors are well-known predictors of sickness absence. It remains, however, unclear whether these associations are causal or due to confounding factors. The co-twin control method allows examining causal hypotheses by controlling for familial confounding (shared genes and environment). In this study, we applied this design to study the role of education and health behaviors in sickness absence, taking sex and cohort differences into account. METHODS: Participants were two cohorts of in total 8806 Norwegian twins born 1948 to 1960 (older cohort, mean age at questionnaire = 40.3, 55.8% women), and 1967 to 1979 (younger cohort, mean age at questionnaire = 25.6, 58.9% women). Both cohorts had reported their health behaviors (smoking, physical activity and body mass index (BMI)) through a questionnaire during the 1990s. Data on the twins educational attainment and long-term sickness absences between 2000 and 2014 were retrieved from Norwegian national registries. Random (individual-level) and fixed (within-twin pair) effects regression models were used to measure the associations between educational attainment, health behaviours and sickness absence and to test the effects of possible familial confounding. RESULTS: Low education and poor health behaviors were associated with a higher proportion of sickness absence at the individual level. There were stronger effects of health behaviors on sickness absence in women, and in the older cohort, whereas the effect of educational attainment was similar across sex and cohorts. After adjustment for unobserved familial factors (genetic and environmental factors shared by twin pairs), the associations were strongly attenuated and non-significant, with the exception of health behaviors and sickness absence among men in the older cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between educational attainment, health behaviors, and sickness absence seem to be confounded by unobserved familial factors shared by co-twins. However, the association between health behaviors and sickness absence was consistent with a causal effect among men in the older cohort. Future studies should consider familial confounding, as well as sex and age/cohort differences, when assessing associations between education, health behaviors and sickness absence.

This study aims to explore the combined effect of dual sensory impairment (DSI) and multimorbidity patterns on functional impairment among middle-aged and older adults in China. METHODS: Data were from 10,217 adults aged 45 or older from four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Sensory impairments were self-reported measures. Multimorbidity patterns were identified by using k-means cluster analyses. Functional impairment was defined using activities of daily living (ADL) scale and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale. Generalized estimating equation models were estimated to assess the effect of co-occurring DSI and multimorbidity on functional impairment. RESULTS: DSI prevalence was 50.4%, and multimorbidity prevalence was 37.7% at the baseline. The simultaneous presence of DSI and multimorbidity was associated with increased odds of ADL limitations (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 2.11C2.43) and IADL limitations (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.77C2.02). Five multimorbidity patterns were identified: the cardio-cerebrovascular pattern, the stomach-arthritis pattern, the respiratory pattern, the hepatorenal pattern, and the unspecified pattern. Compared to DSI only, DSI plus the hepatorenal pattern was most strongly associated with functional impairment (for ADL: OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 2.34C3.12; for IADL: OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.77C2.36). CONCLUSION: Middle-aged and older adults with co-occurrence of DSI and multimorbidity are at increased risk of functional impairment, especially those with multimorbidity characterized by the hepatorenal pattern. These findings imply that integrated care for DSI and multimorbidity may be a potent pathway in improving functional status.","output":"The Effect of Dual Sensory Impairment and Multimorbidity Patterns on Functional Impairment: A Longitudinal Cohort of Middle-Aged and Older Adults in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study estimates the influence of anthropogenic emission reductions on nitrogen dioxide ([Formula: see text]) and ozone ([Formula: see text]) concentration changes in Germany during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic period using in\\\\situ surface and Sentinel\\\\5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite column measurements and GEOS\\\\Chem model simulations.

Office-based buprenorphine treatment is essential for expanding access to OUD treatment; however, few studies examine the cascade of care specifically for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Our objective was to describe a cascade of care for patients referred for office-based buprenorphine treatment in the primary care setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD who were referred for office-based buprenorphine treatment within a large, urban health care system between 2018 and 2019. Our primary outcomes included completion of each step of the buprenorphine treatment cascade of care: 1) referred for treatment, 2) scheduled initial visit, 3) completed initial visit, 4) initiated buprenorphine treatment, and 5) retained in treatment at 90 days. We constructed a cascade of care by calculating proportions of patients identified at every step, starting with the total number of patients referred for treatment as the first step. We extracted data from the program's referral database and electronic medical record system. We compared characteristics of patients referred who initiated buprenorphine to those referred who did not initiate buprenorphine treatment using chi-squared tests and t-tests. To account for the hierarchical nature of the data, we conducted a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling to test the differences in attrition rates among the steps of the cascade of care. RESULTS: In the 24-month period between 2018 and 2019, 226 patients were referred for office-based buprenorphine treatment at Montefiore's Buprenorphine Treatment Network. Patients' mean age at referral was 47 years, and most were male (68.6%), Hispanic (49.6%), and publicly insured (75.7%). Among all patients, 182 (80.5%) were scheduled for an initial visit, 142 (62.8%) completed the initial visit, 134 (59.3%) initiated buprenorphine treatment, and 95 (42.0%) were retained in treatment at 90 days. 37.2% of all patients referred did not complete the initial visit. A GEE model showed that attrition is significantly steeper in the first two steps of the cascade of care, compared to the later three steps (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.31-2.91, p < 0.05). Compared to referred patients who did not initiate treatment, those referred who initiated treatment were more likely to be using non-prescribed buprenorphine at time of referral (19.4% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.05) and be self-referred (22.4% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe a cascade of care for office-based buprenorphine treatment in a large health care system. The study observed the steepest attrition in the first two steps of the cascade of care, where more than a third of patients referred did not complete the initial visit. Patients who were self-referred, or using non-prescribed buprenorphine were more likely to initiate treatment.

No studies have assessed the effect of IP. We wished to determine the distribution of IP optometrists and associated hospital referral rates across Scotland. METHODS In 2019, FOI requests (General Optical Council and NHS Education Scotland) identified all registered IP optometrists in Scotland and their registered postcodes. Data regarding community eye examinations and referrals to HES since 2010 were gathered via Information Services Division of NHS Scotland. RESULTS As of March 2019, there were 278 IP optometrists in Scotland (278/1189; 23.4%). Two hundred eighteen IP optometrists work in 293 practices across 11 of Scotland's 14 health boards. There was a strong correlation (r = +0.96) between population density and number of IP optometrists. Fifty-six percent of IP optometrists work in the two most deprived quintiles. Since IP's introduction, there has been a marked increase in anterior segment supplementary visits (+290%). Optometry referrals to GPs have reduced by 10.5%, but referrals to HES have increased by 118% (to 96,315). There was no correlation between quantity of IP optometrists and referral rates to HES (r = -0.06, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.56, p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS This is the first analysis of IP optometrists and associated referral rates in Scotland.

On the other hand, commonly used surface passivation by the oligo(ethylene glycol)-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) shows no potential to induce dependency of the YAP distribution on RGD concentrations. The results indicate that the antifouling background is a crucial component of surface-based cellular response studies, and pCB-based zwitterionic antifouling brush architectures may serve as a potential next-generation easily functionable surface platform for the monitoring and quantification of cellular processes.","output":"Functionalizable Antifouling Coatings as Tunable Platforms for the Stress-Driven Manipulation of Living Cell Machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that can infect animal and human hosts. The infection induces mild or sometimes severe acute respiratory diseases. Nowadays, the appearance of a new, highly pathogenic and lethal coronavirus variant, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for a pandemic (COVID-19), represents a global problem for human health. Unfortunately, only limited approaches are available to treat coronavirus infections and a vaccine against this new coronavirus variant is not yet available. The plasma membrane microdomain lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in the replication cycle of numerous viruses, including coronaviruses. Indeed, some pathogen recognition receptors for coronaviruses as for other viruses cluster into lipid rafts, and it is therefore conceivable that the first contact between virus and host cells occurs into these specialized regions, representing a port of cell entry for viruses. Recent data highlighted the peculiar pro-viral or anti-viral role played by autophagy in the host immune responses to viral infections. Coronaviruses, like other viruses, were reported to be able to exploit the autophagic machinery to increase their replication or to inhibit the degradation of viral products. Agents known to disrupt lipid rafts, such as metil--cyclodextrins or statins, as well as autophagy inhibitor agents, were shown to have an anti-viral role. In this review, we briefly describe the involvement of lipid rafts and autophagy in coronavirus infection and replication.

The objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate an ETL tool that transforms the PCORnet CDM format data into the OMOP CDM. METHODS: We developed an open-source ETL tool to facilitate the data conversion from the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The ETL tool was evaluated using a dataset with 1000 patients randomly selected from the PCORnet CDM at Mayo Clinic. Information loss, data mapping accuracy, and gap analysis approaches were conducted to assess the performance of the ETL tool. We designed an experiment to conduct a real-world COVID-19 surveillance task to assess the feasibility of the ETL tool. We also assessed the capacity of the ETL tool for the COVID-19 data surveillance using data collection criteria of the MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project. RESULTS: After the ETL process, all the records of 1000 patients from 18 PCORnet CDM tables were successfully transformed into 12 OMOP CDM tables. The information loss for all the concept mapping was less than 0.61%. The string mapping process for the unit concepts lost 2.84% records. Almost all the fields in the manual mapping process achieved 0% information loss, except the specialty concept mapping. Moreover, the mapping accuracy for all the fields were 100%.

It is well known that the electricity consumption is a direct reflection of human activity. During the lockdown of Wuhan, most of human activities were forbidden. The reduction in human activity would inevitably lead to a reduction in electricity consumption. At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants would also be reduced with the reduction of human activity. In this study, the correlation between electricity consumption and air pollutants during lockdown was discussed in detail. The result showed that the drop in pollutants concentrations in January should be attributed to the washout effect of rainfall rather than the lockdown. The decrease of electricity consumption in the secondary industry might play a significant role on the decrease of PM [Formula: see text] and NO(2) concentrations in Wuhan in February 2020. The decrease in NO(2) concentration in March should be attributed to the reduction of pollutants emissions from the tertiary industry, which means that more attention should be paid to the control of NO(2) emission in the tertiary industry.

Nevertheless, evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is still limited and mixed. In this study, we estimated the pandemic impact on HAI incidence and investigated the HAI type occurring in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to the main ICU of the Umberto I teaching hospital of Rome from March 1st and April 4th 2020 were compared with patients hospitalized in 2019. We assessed the association of risk factors and time-to-first event through multivariable Fine and Greys regression models, that consider the competitive risk of death on the development of HAI (Model 1) or device related-HAI (dr-HAI, Model 2) and provide estimates of the sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) and its associated confidence interval (CI). A subgroup analysis was performed on the 2020 cohort. RESULTS: Data from 104 patients were retrieved. Overall, 59 HAIs were recorded, 32 of which occurred in the COVID-19 group. Patients admitted in 2020 were found to be positively associated with both HAI and dr-HAI onset (SHR: 2.66, 95% CI 1.31C5.38, and SHR: 10.0, 95% CI 1.84C54.41, respectively). Despite being not confirmed at the multivariable analysis, a greater proportion of dr-HAIs seemed to occur in COVID-19 patients, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-related urinary tract infections.

Although a link between predation and population growth has been demonstrated in experimental evolution studies, insights from natural populations are lacking. Here we tested for evolutionary changes in the population dynamics of the herbivorous water flea Daphnia pulicaria in response to the invasion of the predatory spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) in the Great Lakes region, USA. Using a resurrection ecological approach and a 3-month population growth experiment (in the absence of predation) we compared population dynamics in daphnia from pre- and post-invasion time periods. Post-invasion daphnia were able to maintain an overall higher population abundance throughout the growth experiment, both in terms of the number of individuals (28% higher) and total population biomass (33% higher). Estimation of population dynamics parameters from a theta-logistic model suggested that this was achieved through an increase in intrinsic population growth rate as well as increased carrying capacity. The observed difference in intrinsic rate of increase could not be predicted based on previous measurements of life-history traits in these clones. This indicates that care should be taken when extrapolating from a few life history traits measured in isolated individuals under controlled conditions to population dynamics. Whereas previous experimental evolution studies of predator-prey interactions have demonstrated that genotypes that have evolved under predation have inferior population growth when the predator is absent, this was not the case for the Daphnia. We suggest that complexities in ecological interactions of natural ecosystems, such as the potential for spatial and temporal avoidance of predation, makes it challenging to provide general predictions about evolutionary responses in population dynamics to predators.","output":"Evolution of Daphnia population dynamics following invasion by a non-native predator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 era represented an important stressful event affecting population in many different ways, with important negative impact on social, working and relational life.

Also, it aimed at ascertaining, for the first time, the effect of changes in climatic conditions (spring versus summer) on the aforementioned steroids, testicular volume, testicular echotexture (pixel intensity; PI, and integrated density; ID), and semen quality in goats. Saliva and plasma samples were collected from 7 male Shiba goats weekly in spring and summer for measurement of testosterone (T; ng/ml), estradiol (E2; pg/ml), and cortisol (ng/ml) using radioimmunoassay. The changes in testicular volumes (TV/ml) and echogenicity were monitored weekly using ultrasonographic assessments concomitantly with subjective evaluations of semen parameters. Results revealed a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.72; P < 0.0001) between plasma and salivary cortisol. Mild significant positive correlation was found between salivary and plasma T levels (r = 0.31; P < 0.002). However, low non-significant negative correlation was reported between salivary and plasma E2 levels (r = -0.24; P > 0.05). Higher levels of salivary cortisol were found in summer than in the spring (3.8  0.6 ng/ml versus 1.4  0.3 ng/ml; P < 0.001). However, no differences in levels of T, E2, and plasma cortisol were recorded between spring and summer (P > 0.05).

While journalism is meant to process yet unknown events by design, the dynamically evolving situation affected all aspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis reporting seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race reporting and uncritical coverage, with journalism being too close to official statements and too affirmative of political decisions. However, empirical data on the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been lacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of journalistic news media during the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors, negativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and conspiracy theories were examined. The topical structure of the near-time Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall, journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling, information-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective coverage of the crisis.","output":"Pandemic News: Facebook Pages of Mainstream News Media and the Coronavirus Crisis -- A Computational Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is one of the few studies that discusses the impacts and challenges of banking business, especially online credit loans (also known as Internet loans or consumption loans) from the aspects of social environment, economic development, public policy, and technological environment changes under the impact of COVID-19 epidemic.

The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway.

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16C21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16C18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections. The mechanisms that underpin faster clearance and lower rates of sustained anti-S1 production may impact on the longevity of humoral immunity.

The high patient mortality is partly attributed to thrombotic events. An emerging trend is the presence of immunological phenomena including antiphospholipid antibodies which may promote thrombosis. The mechanism for these observations is not clear though many patients with SARS-CoV-2 develop thrombocytopenia. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis who presented with intermediate risk pulmonary embolism (PE). Careful attention to his daily platelet count suggested the possibility of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) which was confirmed by laboratory testing and resolved when anticoagulation was switched to a direct thrombin inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Since excessive platelet activation and in situ thrombosis occur in HIT, this case underscores the need to consider that thrombocytopenia in patients with SARS-CoV-2most of whom receive heparinoidsmay be unrecognized HIT.

Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.","output":"Alu RNA regulates the cellular pool of active ribosomes by targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to 40S subunits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, many that have chosen not to be vaccinated have done so because of vaccine hesitancy. This highlights the need for tools that accurately capture the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccines, and provide steps toward improving vaccine acceptance. METHODS: Participants of the Arizona CoVHORT (COVID-19 Cohort) received a one-time, electronic based cross-sectional questionnaire intended to capture underlying motivations regarding vaccination, as well as hesitations that may prevent people from getting vaccinated. Rasch analysis was conducted among 4703 CoVHORT participants who had completed the vaccine questionnaire to assess questionnaire reliability and validity. Response categories were grouped to optimize scale functioning and to ensure independent probabilities of participant endorsement. RESULTS: A total of 4703 CoVHORT participants completed the questionnaire, of whom 68% were female, and who had a mean age of 48 years. Participants were primarily White (90%), highly educated (63% with a college degree or above, with most respondents (45%) having an income of more than $75,000 per annum. The results indicated the questionnaire has good reliability and construct validity for assessing attitudes and beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccines. In-fit mean-squares for included items ranged from 0.61 to 1.72 and outfit mean-squares ranged from 0.56 to 1.75, and correlation coefficients ranged from 0.25 to 0.75.

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of monthly operative case volumes and types for 8 residency programs for 2019 and January through April 2020. Cases were grouped as elective cranial, elective spine, and nonelective emergent cases. Programs were surveyed regarding residents' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training, didactics, and research participation. Data were analyzed for individual programs and pooled across programs. RESULTS: Across programs, the 2019 monthly mean  SD case volume was 211  82; 2020 mean  SD case volumes for January, February, March, and April were 228  93, 214  84, 180  73, and 107  45.

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","output":"A Review: Does Complement or the Contact System Have a Role in Protection or Pathogenesis of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abomasitis in calvesAortic aneurysm in a dairy cowAbortion due to Salmonella Brandenberg in ewesStreptococcus dysgalactia polyarthritis in lambs These are among matters discussed in the Northern Ireland animal disease surveillance quarterly report for January to March 2016.","output":"Northern Ireland disease surveillance report, January to March 2016."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis is likely to have dramatic consequences for progress on climate change.

Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to better guide the response to the current epidemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese database), Clinical Trials.gov and chictr.org.cn (China). The methodological quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by the Begg's test. Results: We analyzed 49 studies involving 1627 patients. In the pooled data, the most common clinical symptoms were fever (56% [0.50-0.61]) and cough (45% [0.39-0.51]). The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated procalcitonin (40% [0.23-0.57]), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (31% [0.19-0.43]), increased lymphocyte count (28% [0.17-0.42]), increased creatine kinase (28% [0.18- 0.40]), and elevated C-reactive protein (26% [0.17-0.36]). The most common abnormalities determined by computed tomography were lower-lobe involvement (56% [0.42- 0.70]), ground-glass opacities (33% [0.25-0.42]), bilateral pneumonia (32% [0.24- 0.40]), patchy shadowing (31% [0.18- 0.45]), and upper lobe involvement (30% [0.20- 0.41]). Conclusion: Disease severity among children and adolescents with COVID-19 was milder than that among adult patients, with a greater proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases, and thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and control of the infection source are more challenging.","output":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(-)-Englerin A (EA), a potential novel anti-cancer drug, is a potent selective activator of classical transient receptor potential 4 and 5 (TRPC4, TRPC5) channels. As TRPC4 channels are expressed and functional in the lung endothelium, possible side effects such as lung edema formation may arise during its administration. Well-established in vivo rodent models for toxicological testing, however, rapidly degrade this compound to its inactive derivative, englerin B. Therefore, we chose an ex vivo isolated perfused and ventilated murine lung (IPVML) model to detect edema formation due to toxicants, which also reduces the number of incriminating animal experiments required. To evaluate the sensitivity of the IPVML model, short-time (10 min) drops of the pH from 7.4 down to 4.0 were applied, which resulted in linear changes of tidal volumes, wet-to-dry weight ratios and incorporation of FITC-coupled dextran particles from the perfusate. As expected, biological activity of EA was preserved after perfusion in the IPVML model. Concentrations of 50-100 nM EA continuously perfused through the IPVML model did not change tidal volumes and lung weights significantly. Wet-to-dry weight ratios were increased after perfusion of 100 nM EA but permeation of FITC-coupled dextran particles from the perfusate to the lung tissues was not significantly different. Therefore, EA shows little or no significant acute pulmonary toxicity after application of doses expected to activate target ion channels and the IPVML is a sensitive powerful ex vivo model for evaluating acute lung toxicity in accordance with the 3R rules for animal experimentation.","output":"An ex vivo perfused ventilated murine lung model suggests lack of acute pulmonary toxicity of the potential novel anticancer agent (-)-englerin A."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine whether Seraph-100 (Exthera Medical Corporation, Martinez, CA) treatment provides clinical benefit for severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases that require mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.

Starting March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model the before and after disease dynamics, and is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period.

Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a lab-based qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay. The availability of a rapid NAAT, such as the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay, at the point of care (POC) or in laboratories that do not have access to large platform NAAT could increase the percentage of individuals who receive an acute HIV infection status or confirmation of their HIV status, while immediately linking them to counseling and medical care.

As such, we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS). DESIGN AND SETTING: National-based survey cross-sectional study during the lockdown in Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index. METHODS: Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying the proper cut-off scores. RESULTS: After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: stereotype, prejudice and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and experts perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank, 95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index were <0.2, supporting the discriminant validity.

Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points). CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, the treatment of head and neck cancer patients is not deferrable, and an integrated strategy is required. The aim of the current article is to present the experience in the management of head and neck patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at the research hospital Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza. This review contains replicable and widely usable instructions on how to avoid delays in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck tumors and to ensure a gradual return to elective procedures. MAIN TEXT: The Head and Neck Department of the research hospital Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza includes an Otolaryngology and a Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, both of which deal with the diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant pathologies of the head and neck, as well as urgent/emergent consultations and surgical procedures that necessitate time sensitive operative management, such as cochlear implantation (CI). Given these premises and the complexity of the Department, the COVID-19 organizing protocol of the research hospital Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza was divided into two phases in accordance with the different stages of the pandemic and the priority of treatment. Special attention was given to the medical surveillance of health care workers and hospitalized patients, to the organization of the outpatient clinic and the operating setting as well as to the implementation of telehealth systems. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is going to be a long-term situation with lasting effects on the public health and the entire society. Therefore, an efficient health care system has to adopt a double strategy: always being ready for a new wave of the pandemic and not forgetting non-COVID-19 patients, among whom head and neck cancer patients represent a priority.

METHODS: 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. RESULTS: Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices. CONCLUSION: Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung.","output":"Clinical characteristics and changes of chest CT features in 307 patients with common COVID-19 pneumonia infected SARS-CoV-2: A multicenter study in Jiangsu, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised a global public health concern.

Limited information exists in Tanzania on antimicrobial resistance surveillance to delineate the potential sources of multi-drug-resistant bacteria for specific mitigation strategies among orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza city between January and May 2020. It involved the collection of rectal swabs/stools, hand swabs, and environmental sampling to identify extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria. Participants data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed to determine factors associated with ESBL colonization among index orthopaedic patients and correlates with other ESBL sources using OR (95% CI) and a cut-off p-value of 0.05. RESULTS: We found that 47.2% (125/265) of index patients, 77.8% (14/18) of neighbouring patients, 8.3% (2/24) of health-care workers, 72.2% (13/18) of non-medical caregivers, and 31.4% (27/86) of samples taken from the hospital environment had ESBL producers. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. predominated among participants and Acinetobacter spp. predominated in the environmental samples. Patients with open fractures had increased odds of being colonized with ESBL producers [OR (95% CI): 2.08 (1.16C3.75); p=0.015]. The floor below patients beds was commonly contaminated; however, the odds of environmental contamination decreased on the third round of sampling [OR (95% CI: 0.16 (0.04C0.67); p=0.012], apparently as a result of parallel infection prevention and control responsive measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: We found a high occurrence of ESBL colonization among participants and in the environmentat this tertiary hospital. The importance of routine ESBL surveillance among orthopaedic patients with open fractures on admission and strengthened decontamination of health-care premises is reiterated.","output":"Gastrointestinal Tract Colonization Rate of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Gram-Negative Bacteria and Associated Factors Among Orthopaedic Patients in a Tertiary Hospital in Tanzania: Implications for Infection Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The education sector is always facing challenges related to various teaching and learning aspects With continuous advancements in education technology, students, as well as staff, constantly face issues related to upgrading their knowledge to the next level During the situation of COVID-19 pandemic, many educational organizations were forced to adopt these technologies very rapidly in order to keep themselves on track and not to lose their students involvement This research paper has shown the effect of mobile technology and its role in the e-learning process during the online mode of study A survey was conducted having 206 participants The questionnaire was having 27 attributes The research has used association rule mining technique such as CN2 Rule Induction Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce the components and the gradient approach was used to optimize the results The study shows a high impact on learning with the usage of mobile phones and better internet infrastructure providing learning anywhere at any time ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Educational association mining on the use of media platforms for e-learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The European Union Clinical Trials Register is a public facing portal containing information on trials of medicinal products conducted under the purview of the European Union regulatory system. As of September 2021, the registry holds information on over 40,000 trials. Given its distinct regulatory purpose, and results reporting requirements, the European Union Clinical Trials Register should be a valuable open-source hub for trial information. Past work examining the European Union Clinical Trials Register has suggested that data quality on the registry may be lacking. We therefore set out to examine the quality and availability of trial data on the registry with a focus on areas that fall under the authority of regulators in each European Union/European Economic Area country. METHODS: Using data scraped from the full European Union Clinical Trials Register public dataset, we examined the extent of issues with three areas of trial data availability linked to European Union regulations. We examined whether there is evidence for missing registration of protocols in the public database, whether information on the completion of clinical trials is being made available and how often the results of trials are posted to the registry. We assessed each area overall, and examined variation between national regulators and over time. RESULTS: Major issues with the availability of expected protocols and information on trial completion were focused in a few countries. Overall, when comparing enrolment countries from tabular results to available registrations, 26,932 of 31,118 (86.5%) expected protocols were available and 22 of 30 (73%) countries had over 90% of expected protocols available. The majority of missing protocols, totalling 2764 (66%), were from just three countries: France, Norway and Poland. Evidence for this issue is further supported by data on trends in new registrations by country over time. Low availability of data on trial completion is also most pronounced in a minority of countries, like Spain and the Netherlands, with consistent trends for missingness over time. Finally, overall results availability is substantially worse among the 23,623 trials with a single registered European Union protocol (n = 6259, 26.5%) compared to 13,897 of those taking place in multiple countries (n = 8423, 60.6%). Reporting for single-protocol trials was consistently low across both time and location. CONCLUSION: Deficiencies in the public availability of trial protocols, trial completion information and summary results complicate the utility of the European Union Clinical Trials Register for research, transparency and accountability efforts. Users of the registry would benefit from a more complete and accurate accounting of the European research environment via the official European Union registry. We recommend regulators at the national and pan-national level undertake routine audits of approved trials to ensure national-level issues are proactively and transparently identified, documented and addressed.","output":"Trends and variation in data quality and availability on the European Union Clinical Trials Register: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 2020, the Act on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and Response has been a significant statute in dealing with COVID-19 in Japan. The Act mandates requests and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, as well as stay-at-home requests. Although there have been no penalties as of January 2021, these requests and orders limit freedom of movement and establishment, guaranteed rights under the Japanese Constitution. This article poses the following research question: \\"Does the Japanese Constitution allow measures against COVID-19 such as requests and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, and stay-at-home requests?\\" It also asks: \\"Are measures with penalties allowed by the Constitution?\\" This paper introduces constitutional concepts that guarantee or limit individual freedom. Concepts that guarantee individual freedoms include freedom of establishment and movement. These freedoms derive from the constitutional values of freedom to choose one's occupation and choose and change one's residence (Art. 22) and the right to own or hold property (Art. 29). Concepts that limit individual freedom include the right to life (Art. 13), welfare rights and public health (Art. 25), and public welfare (Art. 13). Individual freedom that threatens right to life, welfare rights and public health, and public welfare may not be guaranteed. This paper argues that since measures against COVID-19 are considered public welfare, the Constitution allows the limiting of freedom of establishment and movement. Furthermore, from the perspectives of the right to life, welfare rights, and public health, the government is responsible for reducing the risk to life from COVID-19. It also argues that the Constitution permits measures with penalties, while proportionality needs to be considered.

Consequently, a large volume of false textual information has been disseminating for a long time since the prevalence of social media. The potential negative influence of misinformation on the public is a growing concern. Therefore, it is strongly motivated to detect online misinformation as early as possible. Few-shot-few-clue learning applies in this misinformation detection task when the number of annotated statements is quite few (called few shots) and the corresponding evidence is also quite limited in each shot (called few clues). Within the few-shot-few-clue framework, we propose a Bayesian meta-learning algorithm to extract the shared patterns among different topics (i.e.different tasks) of misinformation. Moreover, we derive a scalable method, i.e., amortized variational inference, to optimize the Bayesian meta-learning algorithm. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm.

Consequently, this situation resulted in manpower and resource costs, leading to the widespread and exponential rise of infected cases at the early stage of the epidemic. To limit the spread of infection, the Chinese government adopted innovative, specialized, and advanced systems, including empowered Fangcang and Internet hospitals, as well as high technologies such as 5G, big data analysis, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

OBJECTIVE: Based on the quadruple helix model, the aim of this study was to construct and analyze the structure and content of the internet information sources regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, considering time and space. The broader goal was to determine the status and limitations of web information transmission and online communication structure during public health emergencies. METHODS: By sorting the second top-level domain, we divided the structure of network information sources into four levels: government, educational organizations, companies, and nonprofit organizations. We analyzed the structure of information sources and the evolution of information content at each stage using quadruple helix and network analysis methods. RESULTS: The results of the structural analysis indicated that the online sources of information in Asia were more diverse than those in other regions in February 2020. As the pandemic spread in April, the information sources in non-Asian regions began to diversify, and the information source structure diversified further in July. With the spread of the pandemic, for an increasing number of countries, not only the government authorities of high concern but also commercial and educational organizations began to produce and provide significant amounts of information and advice. Nonprofit organizations also produced information, but to a lesser extent. The impact of the virus spread from the initial public level of the government to many levels within society. After April, the governments role in the COVID-19 network information was central. The results of the content analysis showed that there was an increased focus on discussion regarding public healthCrelated campaign materials at all stages. The information content changed with the changing stages. In the early stages, the basic situation regarding the virus and its impact on health attracted most of the attention. Later, the content was more focused on prevention. The business and policy environment also changed from the beginning of the pandemic, and the social changes caused by the pandemic became a popular discussion topic. CONCLUSIONS: For public health emergencies, some online and offline information sources may not be sufficient. Diversified institutions must pay attention to public health emergencies and actively respond to multihelical information sources. In terms of published messages, the educational sector plays an important role in public health events. However, educational institutions release less information than governments and businesses.

Poor evaluation methods could lead to misinformation on optimal facemasks use; a high-throughput, reproducible method which illuminates the issue of fit influencing aerosol transmission is needed. To this end, we have created an in vitro model to quantify particle transmission by mimicking exhalation aerosols in a 3D printed face-nose-mouth replica via a nebulizer and quantifying particle counts using a hand-held particle counter. A sewn, sewn with pipe cleaner nose piece, and sewn with a coffee filter facemask were used to evaluate current common homemade sewn facemask designs, benchmarked against industry standard surgical, N95 respirator tightly fit, and N95 respirator loosely fit facemasks. All facemasks have significantly reduced particle counts in front of the facemask, but the side and top of the facemask showed increases in particle counts over the no facemask condition at that same position, suggesting that some proportion of aerosols are being redirected to these gaps. An altered size distribution of aerosols that escape at the vulnerable positions was observed; escaped particles have larger count median diameters, with a decreased ratio of smaller to larger particles, possibly due to hygroscopic growth or aggregation. Of the homemade sewn facemasks, the facemask with a coffee filter insert performed the best at reducing escaped aerosols, with increased efficiency also observed for sewn masks with a pipe cleaner nose piece. Importantly, there were minimal differences between facemasks at increasing distances, which supports that social distance is a critical element in reducing aerosol transmission. This work brings to light the importance of quantifying particle count in positions other than directly in front of the facemask and identifies areas of research to be explored.","output":"Check the gap: Facemask performance and exhaled aerosol distributions around the wearer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To evaluate the short-term effects of a standardized first-line noninvasive approach (FL-A) including counseling and self-management strategies on pain, masticatory muscle tenderness, and awake bruxism in women with chronic temporomandibular disorder myalgia (mTMD) and to test whether patients' trait anxiety predicted their response to treatment. METHODS FL-A was administered to 14 women with chronic mTMD (mean age  SD = 33.8  11.1 years; 8 with Graded Chronic Pain Scale [GCPS] grade I and 6 with grade II). Its effects on facial pain, masticatory muscle tenderness, and spontaneous awake bruxism episodes were evaluated using questionnaires, surface electromyography, and quantitative sensory testing. General linear models were used to test FL-A efficacy after 1 (T1) and 2 (T2) months. RESULTS FL-A reduced pain (from baseline [T0] to T2, P = .010), the frequency of awake bruxism episodes (T0 to T1, P = .024), and their intensity by about 30% (T0 to T1, P < .001).

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been regularly employed to investigate the neural aspects of the psychosocial stress response, but these results have not yet been unified. Therefore, in this article, we systematically review the current EEG literature in which spectral analyses were employed to investigate the neural psychosocial stress response and interpret the results with regard to the three stress phases (anticipatory, reactive, and recovery) in which the response can be divided. Our results show that three EEG measures, alpha power, beta power and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), are commonly utilized and that alpha power consistently decreases, beta power shows a tendency to increase, and FAA varies inconsistently. We furthermore found that whereas changes in alpha power are independent of the stress phase, and changes in beta power show a relative stress phase independent trend, other EEG measures such as delta power, theta power, relative gamma and theta-alpha power ratio show less stress phase independent changes. Meta-analyses conducted on alpha power, beta power and FAA further revealed a significant effect size (hedge's g = 0.6; p = 0.001) for alpha power, but an insignificant effect size for beta power (hedge's g = ?0.31; p = 0.29) and FAA (hedge's g = 0.01, p = 0.93). From our results, it can be concluded that psychosocial stress results in significant changes in some spectral EEG indices, but that more research is needed to further uncover the precise (temporal) mechanisms underlying these neural responses.","output":"The neural correlates of psychosocial stress: A systematic review and meta-analysis of spectral analysis EEG studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Better understanding of the frequency of dental emergencies and the procedures performed during those emergency visits can help providers, insurers, and policymakers understand workforce and care provision needs. METHODS: Procedures performed at an emergency dental encounter and in the encounter following that encounter are assessed. Emergency dental encounters are those with a CDT code of D0140, D0160, or D0170. Data was analyzed from the IBM Watson Medicaid Marketscan data from 2013 to 2017, a nationally representative dental and medical claims database from 13 deidentified states in the United States. RESULT: Consistently over time, about 10% of all dental encounters are due to a dental emergency. 28% of emergency dental encounters had no other procedure performed during those encounters. When other procedures were performed during the encounter, the majority were diagnostic in nature, primarily radiographs. Among patients who returned to the dentists following an emergency visit, 43% returned for more definitive dental treatment, most within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of dental emergency encounters do not result in definitive treatment, rather patients often return to the dentist at a later date for that treatment.

Outcomes compare primary DES versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), overall DES (primary and provisional) versus standard care (PTA and provisional Zilver bare metal stent [BMS]), and provisional DES versus provisional BMS. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease were randomly assigned to DES (n=236) or PTA (n=238). Approximately 91% had claudication; 9% had critical limb ischemia. Patients experiencing acute PTA failure underwent secondary randomization to provisional BMS (n=59) or DES (n=61). The 1-year primary end points of event-free survival and patency showed superiority of primary DES in comparison with PTA; these results were sustained through 5 years. Clinical benefit (freedom from persistent or worsening symptoms of ischemia; 79.8% versus 59.3%, P<0.01), patency (66.4% versus 43.4%, P<0.01), and freedom from reintervention (target lesion revascularization, 83.1% versus 67.6%, P<0.01) for the overall DES group were superior to standard care in nonrandomized comparisons. Similarly, clinical benefit (81.8% versus 63.8%, P=0.02), patency (72.4% versus 53.0%, P=0.03), and freedom from target lesion revascularization (84.9% versus 71.6%, P=0.06) with provisional DES were improved over provisional BMS. These results represent >40% relative risk reduction for restenosis and target lesion revascularization through 5 years for the overall DES in comparison with standard care and for provisional DES in comparison with provisional BMS.

Methods An electronic 22-item survey was distributed to critical care health care professionals to capture opinions and perceived impacts of expanded CCP coverage. The perceived importance of 25 evidence-informed CCP activities was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Results Thirty-eight complete responses were included (15% response rate, based on distribution of the survey to 249 health care professionals). Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements: CCPs are integral members of the critical care team (34/38 [89%]), CCPs play an important role in improving patient outcomes (34/38 [89%]), the presence of CCPs on the unit and on patient care rounds allows other health care professionals to concentrate on their own professional responsibilities (33/38 [87%]), and the expanded CCP coverage improved patient care (29/35 [83%]).

Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.","output":"Correcting under-reported COVID-19 case numbers: estimating the true scale of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being a typical ground-breeding bird of the agricultural landscape in Germany, the pheasant has experienced a strong and persistent population decline with a hitherto unexplained cause. Contributing factors to the ongoing negative trend, such as the effects of pesticides, diseases, predation, increase in traffic and reduced fallow periods, are currently being controversially discussed. In the present study, 62 free-ranging pheasant chicks were caught within a two-year period in three federal states of Germany; Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. The pheasant chicks were divided into three age groups to detect differences in their development and physical constitution. In addition, pathomorphological, parasitological, virological, bacteriological and toxicological investigations were performed. The younger chicks were emaciated, while the older chicks were of moderate to good nutritional status. However, the latter age group was limited to a maximum of three chicks per hen, while the youngest age class comprised up to ten chicks. The majority of chicks suffered from dermatitis of the periocular and caudal region of the head (57C94%) of unknown origin. In addition, intestinal enteritis (100%), pneumonia (26%), hepatitis (24%), perineuritis (6%), tracheitis (24%), muscle degeneration (1%) and myositis (1%) were found. In 78% of the cases, various Mycoplasma spp. were isolated. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) was not detected using an MG-specific PCR. Parasitic infections included Philopteridae (55%), Coccidia (48%), Heterakis/Ascaridia spp. (8%) and Syngamus trachea (13%). A total of 8% of the chicks were Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) positive using RT-PCR, 16% positive for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using RT-PCR, and 2% positive for haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) using PCR. All samples tested for avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) or infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were negative. The pool samples of the ten chicks were negative for all acid, alkaline-free and derivative substances, while two out of three samples tested were positive for the herbicide glyphosate. Pheasant chick deaths may often have been triggered by poor nutritional status, probably in association with inflammatory changes in various tissues and organs as well as bacterial and parasitic pathogens.

This Perspective seeks to explore newly occurring cardio-renal-pulmonary organ damage induced or aggravated by the disease process of COVID-19 and its implications for the cardiovascular risk management of people with diabetes, especially taking into account potential interactions with mechanisms of cellular intrusion of SARS-CoV-2. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 can precipitate myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias as well as an acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure. They may evolve along with multiorgan failure directly due to SARS-CoV-2-infected endothelial cells and resulting endotheliitis. This complex pathology may bear challenges for the use of most diabetes medications in terms of emerging contraindications that need close monitoring of all people with diabetes diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whenever possible, continuous glucose monitoring should be implemented to ensure stable metabolic compensation.

This article reviews reproductive justice, discusses contraceptive coercion, examines bias, and highlights interventions that promote equitable reproductive healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Research indicates that both bias and patient characteristics influence provider LARC practices. AYA access to comprehensive LARC services is limited, as counseling, provision, management, and removal are not offered at all sites providing reproductive healthcare to AYAs. Interventions aimed at addressing provider bias and knowledge, clinic policies, confidentiality concerns, insurance reimbursement, and systems of oppression can improve AYA access to equitable, comprehensive contraceptive care. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in reproductive healthcare, as well as provided unique innovations to decrease barriers, including telemedicine LARC services. SUMMARY: Clinicians who care for AYAs should honor reproductive autonomy by approaching contraceptive services with a reproductive justice lens.

However, there are currently few publications that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT: The study consisted in a literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the current status of their approval, and the data available on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this search, the document has been designed taking into account current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in these patients as in other individuals. Some therapies with immunosuppressants might reduce the effectiveness of these vaccines and require the scheduling of their administration, preferably before the start of treatment if possible. CONCLUSION: The data available make it possible to recommend mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Because the life phase of emerging adulthood is crucial for developing health behaviors, this study aims to examine increase in alcohol consumption, single and multiple binge drinking, and associated factors in students during lockdown and post-lockdown periods. METHODS: A prospective open cohort study design with nine survey time points between April 2020 and June 2021 was conducted. The present study uses pooled data from the first survey T0 (3 April to 14 April) and follow-ups at T1 (30 April to 11 May 2020) and T2 (28 May to 8 June 2020). Students from all faculties of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) (N = 12'431) were invited. Of the 1,300 students who participated at baseline and in at least one follow-up, 1,278 (98.3%) completed the questionnaires, final net sample size was 947. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models were used to investigate the factors associated with increases in alcohol consumption based on number of occasions/last 30 days; drinks/week, and binge drinking at T0, and respective changes at T1 and T2 (increases, decreases, no change). RESULTS: Overall, 20% of Swiss university students reported an increased alcohol consumption and 26% engaged in binge drinking. Number of drinks at baseline was associated with a higher probability of increased alcohol consumption, as well as engaging in single and multiple binge drinking events. Higher anxiety scores were associated with a higher probability to increase the alcohol consumption and engaging at least once in binge drinking. Additional factors associated with any binge drinking were male gender, younger age and not living with parents. Higher perceived social support was only associated with engaging in heavy binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of students developed a more risky health behavior regarding alcohol consumption. It is important to identify at risk students and design target prevention including factors such as age, gender and social norms. Further, health behavior and determinants of health behaviors of students should be carefully monitored during the further course of the pandemic.","output":"Change in Alcohol Consumption and Binge Drinking in University Students During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO declared the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak a pandemic in March 11, 2020.

Concerns or unknowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic have also affected physicians behavior, including the use of antibiotics. However, the high rate of antibiotic use in patients, especially those with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, is inconsistent with the actual incidence of bacterial co-infections and/or secondary respiratory infections. Thus, it is clear that a careful assessment of the role of antibiotic treatment in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is required.

To identify adults' demographics, dietary habits, and its relationship with food security status amid COVID-19. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between April C June 2020 throughout the United States. Participants (n = 3,133) completed a demographic questionnaire, the modified Dana-Farber's Cancer Institute Eating Habits Questionnaire and USDA Food Security Module once during the study period. Frequency counts and percentages were tabulated for demographics, dietary habits, and food security scores. One-way ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate relationships between dietary habits and food security status and correlations among demographics using STATA v14 at a statistical significance level of P &lt; 0.05. Participants were White (84.5%), female (79.4%), and between the ages of 30 to 49 years old (30.2%). Participants increased their consumption of sweets (43.8%) and salty snacks (37.4%) and decreased their consumption of fruit (33.4%), poultry products (31%) and non-starchy vegetables (28.2%). Average scores for food security were 0.69  1.77.

In the face of risk society, nation-states are no longer singular individuals. In this context, nation-states should be able to eliminate risks that may arise in mutual coordination. Integration theories that can be applied on a regional and global scale have been created by various researchers throughout history for this situation. One of these approaches, functionalism, was created by David Mitrany in the Post-World War II period. Mitrany proposes that with this approach, called functionalism, an international security environment can be achieved based on the idea of intergovernmental functional organizations specializing in this field. The aim of this study was to explain the concept of functionalism identified with Mitrany and the concepts of risk society identified with Ulrich Beck and to address their relationship with each other. In this context, both concepts are explained in detail in the first two parts of the study. In the third part of the study, the Covid-19 epidemic in which the world is already located is presented as an example of the risk society, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is an intergovernmental organization, as an example of a functionalism approach. The relationship between the Covid-19 outbreak and the WHO samples and the two approaches to each other is the main focus of the study. During the study, a detailed literature review was conducted and related concepts were explained, and descriptive research technique was selected as the main method. As a result of the study, it was found that the ability of nation-states to ensure their national security in the face of potential risks that may arise ceases to be a situation that can be done alone. Nation-states must now interact with each o her and ensure international and national security in common coordination. As a result, national security and international security are integrated in the risk society.","output":"ULUSLARARASI GVENLK KAPSAMINDA RSK TOPLUMU VE FONKSYONALST BAKI?

In order to tackle the devastating condition of the virus, countries need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics. Thus, to strengthen the COVID-19 mitigation measures and to give rapid response, there is an urgent need to understand the publics knowledge and attitude about of the pandemic at this critical moment. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of communities about COVID-19 and associated factors among Gondar City residents. METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was done among 623 respondents in Gondar city from April 20-27/2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from different literatures. The data were entered using Epi data version 3.1 and then exported into STATA version 14 for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p value less than 0.05 in the multivariable binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall knowledge and attitude of the community towards COVID19 was 51.85% [95% CI (47.91%-55.78%)] and 53.13% [95% CI (49.20, 57.06%)], respectively. In this study, being married [AOR = 0.60 at 95% CI: (0.42, 0.86)], educational level; primary [AOR = 3.14 at 95% CI: (1.78,5.54)], secondary [AOR = 2.81 at 95% CI: (1.70,4.63)], college and above [AOR = 4.49 at 95% CI: 7.92, 13.98)], and family size [AOR = 1.80, at 95% CI: (1.05, 3.08)] were emerged as statistically significant factors impacting the knowledge of the community about COVID-19.

We should have been better prepared for Covid-19, and even merely scratching the surface of pandemic literature by examining Albert Camuss The Plague and Phillip Roths Nemesis is very revealing. Despite the remarkable heterogeneity of our world, there are some things about disease that are shared globally, and many things that are recorded in literature are pertinent to the current pandemic situation. Remembering past pandemics is vital to dealing with future ones. This article argues that documentation of pandemics offers important reminders of epidemiology but also about how race, class, gender, and sexuality are involved both in the representation and in the movement of disease. Fiction gives us the chance to revise our thinking both about our relationship with microbes and about how we imagine a balance between individual liberties and social responsibility.

As of May 2020, over 5M infections and 300,000 deaths had been reported globally. At the moment, there is limited research evidence from RCTs recommending certain drugs for the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, a number of studies have proposed numerous antiviral agents as a potential treatment option based on experiments done on animal models infected with other viral dis-eases. One such drug is favipiravir. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to examine recent updates about favipiravir and its likely role in the treatment of coronavirus disease. As has been previously reported in literature, favipi-ravir acts as a broad-spectrum medication that prevents the multiplication of flavivirus, filovirus, poliovirus, arenaviruses, and rhinovirus. The drug has recently been reported in some studies as useful in shortening the time of clinical recovery for COVID-19 patients. The study guaranteeing the usefulness of favipiravir in the treatment of the virus has since been withdrawn temporarily. The analysis in the study was largely open-label and non-randomized. Even with its adverse pharmacokinetic profile and the inconclusive data regarding its usefulness in the management of COVID-19, China has authorized the drug as a suitable treatment of COVID-19 patients as of March 2020. Still, favipiravir has been included in a number of ongoing trials, together with other antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir/ ritonavir.","output":"Recent updates published about favipiravir in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased expression and activation of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) could lead to recurrent implantation failure (RIF). Therefore, TNF- inhibition may be a strategic way to enhance the implantation rate in women with RIF. Nowadays, monoclonal antibodies are considered an effective therapeutic method for TNF- inhibition. Unfortunately, monoclonal antibody treatments have several disadvantages. Thus, the design of small molecules capable of inhibiting TNF- has become critical in recent years. In silico drug repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for TNF- inhibition was used in this study. PyRx tools were employed for virtual screening. Additionally, the free energy of binding, the number of hydrogen bonds, and the number of drug contacts with the protein were calculated using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method. Virtual screening results reveal that 17 of 2471 FDA-approved drugs benefited from favorable binding energy with TNF- (delta G < ? 10 kcal/mol). Two of the 17 drugs, progesterone and prednisone, were the most frequently used without adverse effects during pregnancy. As a result, MD simulation was used to investigate these two drugs further. According to the MD simulation results, prednisone appears to have a higher affinity for TNF- than progesterone, and consequently, the prednisone complex stability is higher. For the first time, this study examined the possible role of prednisone and progesterone in inhibiting TNF- using in silico methods.

Prevalence of MMP8 rs11225395 G/G genotype was higher in sepsis patients than in those with non-infective Systemic Inflammatory Reaction Syndrome (35.6 vs. 26%, hazard ratio, HR 1.56, 95% C.I. 1.04C2.42, p = 0.032). G/G patients developed less hyperthermia (p = 0.041), even after stratification for disease severity (p = 0.003). Patients carrying the 6A allele in MMP3 rs3025058 had a higher probability of microbiologically-proven sepsis (HR 1.4. 95%C.I. 1.01C1.94, p = 0.044), particularly when due to virus (H.R. 2.14, 95% C.I. 1.06C4.31, p = 0.046), while MMP-1 G/G genotype patients carried a higher risk for intracellular bacteria (Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella, H.R. 6.46, 95% C.I. 1.58C26.41, p = 0.003).

Several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of PRRS outbreaks. Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants: Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra. RESULTS: Using antiviral screening, we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml (log10)] at 24 h post-infection, whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [virus titer 2.5 TCID(50)/ml (log10)] at 72 h post-infection. C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. CONCLUSION: T. triandra extract could inhibit PRRSV infectivity, whereas C. sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells.

The results promise that Thai medicinal plant extracts, particularly T. triandra and C. sappan extracts, can be developed into pharmaceutical drugs for the prevention of PRRS in pigs.","output":"In vitro screening antiviral activity of Thai medicinal plants against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper positions Open Educational Practices (OEP) as adding significant value to pandemic-era online learning. Much of online learning during Covid was characterised as being low quality, and an emphasis on providing care began to override the impact that reformed pedagogy could have in caring for students. Concepts of Indigenous Knowledge Authority, consent, collaboration, situated knowledge in communities of practice can help to frame how caring pedagogy and cognitive compassion can be cultivated. This paper shares the redevelopment and evaluation of a unit of learning called Cultural Capabilities amidst pandemic pedagogy rhetoric in which care for knowledge and online learning is discussed. The focus of this study was to refine the concept of care and compassion pedagogy whilst developing a sustainable model for caring for knowledge as higher education professionals. The learning design process and emergent outcomes of the evaluation for learning design are shared. Student feedback showed significant appreciation for the learning design, affective experiences of the deeper learning facilitated by OEP and relational learning. Australian Covid lockdowns allowed for new approaches to open engagement to practical care and compassionate practices for learning and knowledges.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","output":"Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: A comparative retrospective cohort study was conducted between the first wave and the second wave to decipher the cause of the enormous spike in COVID-19 cases in the second wave.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, an individual primary case was interviewed using the \\"COVID-19 transmission questionaries sheet\\" to trace the total number of primary cases and age-wise unrestricted social interaction and secondary cases. We assessed the comparative secondary attack rate, incidence proportion rate and to what extent unrestricted social interaction contributed to the surge of COVID-19 cases during the incubation period.Results: Between January-2021 and May-2021, a total of 1587 unrestricted social interactions were traced with 437 primary cases for the second wave. Of those, 36.8% primary cases developed 334 secondary cases. While for the first wave, a total of 436 unrestricted social interactions were traced with 112 primary cases between January-2020 and December-2020. Of those, 25.0% primary cases developed 82 secondary cases. The secondary attack rate rose 2.5-fold in the age group >50years, and rose ~86% in the age group <10years, while it remained stable in the age group 10-50years. The overall 58% increment in secondary attack rate in the second wave indicates changes in the pattern of unrestricted social interaction amongst household members. This was further supported by the incidence proportion rate that surprisingly rose to ~39% in households of two- and three members in the second wave, while it was negligible in the first wave.Conclusion: Changes in the pattern of unrestricted social interaction, which escalated the secondary attack rate, particularly in the age groups of <10 years and >50 years, and a higher incidence proportion rate in the household size of two- and three members in the second wave, could have led to the unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in the second wave.","output":"Role of Secondary Attack Rate in The Surge of COVID 19 Cases: A Comparative Retrospective Cohort Study between First Wave and Second Wave of COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apropos of Kershenobich's interesting editorial titled: Dilemmas of a physician in times of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which he cites multiple drugs under study for COVID-19, many of which we now know to be ineffective, I have noticed the absence of Vitamin D1. It is well known that levels of regulatory T-lymphocytes are decreased in many patients with COVID-19 and can be increased by Vitamin D2 supplementation2. Furthermore, this Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic events, which are frequently observed in COVID-19 by multiple autoimmune-based mechanisms3. Vitamin D deficiency is more frequent in patients with obesity, asthma, and diabetes and therefore, among other factors, these pathologies lead to higher mortality in COVID-19. A recent prospective study of 930 patients showed that Vitamin D provided in the form of calcifediol during hospitalization reduces intensive care unit admission and mortality by more than 50%4. Considering that Vitamin D deficiency increases the cytokine storm and the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 and that this supplement is safe (the risk of toxicity is extremely low at the usual doses), cheap, and well tolerated and is also useful for other pathologies, I believe it is worth using it at least during hospitalization for COVID-19, if not before. However, to date, there is no evidence that Vitamin D administration may have a role in treating patients with COVID-19, and therefore, prospective studies are needed to assess solidly this more than reasonable possibility5,6. Meanwhile, in these pandemic times, we are living in, it seems prudent to recommend the use of Vitamin D to the population now without waiting for more evidence.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors compared undergraduate students perceptions of an asynchronous online format with onsite delivery formats of CAT using a mixed-method design. Students from five successive cohorts (n = 64) in an undergraduate programme were invited to complete a post-training survey which gathered quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: Whilst feedback was positive regarding both formats, the onsite format was preferred qualitatively with several valuable learning outcome themes emerging from the results. These themes included;perceived benefits of self-evaluation of students own culture whilst learning about Aboriginal culture;encouraging to be provided with scenarios, examples and exercises to enhance cultural awareness and engagement with the interactive facilitator approach. There were differing views about the benefits of learning the history of oppression which warrant further research. Research limitations/implications: Results may be applicable to undergraduate allied health students who participate in clinical immersion placements (CIPs) who participate in Aboriginal CAT. Practical implications: Given the changing dynamic in education forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, more resources may need to be directed to improving online training and possibly combining formats in course delivery. Social implications: The strength of the study is that the authors achieved a response rate of 100%, thus the results are highly significant for the sample.

With such drastic increases in opioid misuse, audiologists are more likely to have patients with opioid-induced hearing loss or neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) than in previous years. More attention is needed on how these increases might influence clinical practice and such a discussion could be useful for audiologists. The goal of this article, therefore, is to summarize what is currently known regarding the relationship between opioid misuse and audiology to help guide hearing health care providers (with a particular focus on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS). This article (a) summarizes the overlap in opioid misuse and hearing loss populations, (b) describes the evidence linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, (c) discusses clinical implications that opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS have for practicing audiologists, and (d) recommends directions for future audiological research on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Conclusions There is considerable overlap between populations at-risk for hearing loss and opioid misuse. Additionally, compelling evidence exists linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, but the specific causal mechanisms remain unclear, indicating a need for additional research. This article attempts to fill a gap in the audiological literature and has the potential to serve as a guide for hearing health care providers to make more informed clinical decisions regarding patients with opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Clinicians may wish to consider the concerns raised in this article before intervening with such concerns, especially in the absence of best practice protocols.","output":"Opioid-Induced Hearing Loss and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: Clinical Considerations for Audiologists and Recommendations for Future Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To test whether StandingTall, a home based, e-health balance exercise programme delivered through an app, could provide an effective, self-managed fall prevention programme for community dwelling older people.

PARTICIPANTS: 503 people aged 70 years and older who were independent in activities of daily living, without cognitive impairment, progressive neurological disease, or any other unstable or acute medical condition precluding exercise. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were block randomised to an intervention group (two hours of StandingTall per week and health education; n=254) or a control group (health education; n=249) for two years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the rate of falls (number of falls per person year) and the proportion of people who had a fall over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the number of people who had a fall and the number who had an injurious fall (resulting in any injury or requiring medical care), adherence, mood, health related quality of life, and activity levels over 24 months; and balance and mobility outcomes over 12 months. RESULTS: The fall rates were not statistically different in the two groups after the first 12 months (0.60 falls per year (standard deviation 1.05) in the intervention group; 0.76 (1.25) in the control group; incidence rate ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.13, P=0.071).

Both groups had a similar proportion of people who fell over 24 months (relative risk 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.10, P=0.239), but the proportion of people who had an injurious fall over 24 months was 20% lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (relative risk 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.98, P=0.031). In the intervention group, 68.1% and 52.0% of participants exercised for a median of 114.0 min/week (interquartile range 53.5) after 12 months and 120.4 min/week (38.6) after 24 months, respectively. Groups remained similar in mood and activity levels. The intervention group had a 0.03 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.06) improvement on the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol five dimension five level) utility score at six months, and an improvement in standing balance of 11 s (95% confidence interval 2 to 19 s) at six months and 10 s (1 to 19 s) at 12 months. No serious training related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The StandingTall balance exercise programme did not significantly affect the primary outcomes of this study. However, the programme significantly reduced the rate of falls and the number of injurious falls over two years, with similar but not statistically significant effects at 12 months. E-health exercise programmes could provide promising scalable fall prevention strategies.

However, it is unclear to what extent SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and other causative viruses have been prevailed since the preventative measures were implemented. In this study, we conducted multiples PCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR using nasal swabs from 191 patients with cold-like symptoms in Japan to reveal the causative viruses. As a result, at least one virus were detected in 40 out of 191 (21%) patients. Of these, we frequently identified the human rhinovirus / enterovirus (5.8%, n=11), SARS-CoV-2 (4.2%, n=8) and human metapneumovirus (3.7%, n=7). On the other hand, no influenza virus was detected.

METHODS: The relevant clinical and imaging data of 19 cases, including 10 males and 9 females, with pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) was retrospectively analyzed. One of the cases had received percutaneous lung biopsy, with the clinical, imaging and pathological changes possible to be analyzed. RESULTS: The lesions were mainly located at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, involving multiple lobes and segments. Ground-glass opacities and/or pulmonary opacities were the more often imaging manifestations of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) in early and evolving phases (19/19,100%). By biopsy following percutaneous lung puncture, exudation of slurry, cellulose, RBC and neutrophils, formation of hyaline membrane, squamous metaplasia and organizing exudates were observable at the alveolar space. Some of alveoli collapsed, and some responded to show compensatory emphysema. CONCLUSION: The imaging features of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) include obvious ground-glass opacity and pulmonary consolidation, mainly at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, with rapid changes. The cross-analysis of imaging and pathology preliminary can elucidate the pathological mechanisms of ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation of severe pneumonia.

However, despite recent attempts to improve access, many are not accessible to people with disabilities. With the advent of provincial and federal legislation, standards are being developed to assist with the design and management of parks. OBJECTIVE: The overarching objective of this study is to inform accessibility standards for federal parks that meet the needs of all park visitors, regardless of ability. The specific objectives of this study are to identify park accessibility standards that exist internationally, identify the accessibility challenges that people with disabilities face in park environments, and prioritize and recommend accessibility standards for national parks. METHODS: A 3-phase approach will be used to achieve the study objectives. In the first phase, a scoping review of the existing accessibility standards will be conducted. The second phase will include objective audits of trails and features in 6 parks, 3 in western Canada and 3 in eastern Canada, as well as mobile interviews with 24 diverse participants in each region regarding their experiences of and recommendations for improving the parks accessibility. In the final phase, a Delphi participatory consensus development process will be used, based on the data gathered in the first 2 phases, to prioritize recommendations for standards. RESULTS: We expect to find gaps in existing standards that do not account for the diverse range of accessibility requirements that people with disabilities have for visiting parks. We also expect to find that existing standards, on their own, may not be enough to ensure equitable access to all the experiences and amenities that parks have to offer. Development of subsequent guidelines and best practices may be necessary to address complex scenarios for which standards may not be the best approach to ensuring accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: The participatory and mixed methods approaches used in this study will provide rich insights for developing accessible park standards that consider the diverse needs of people with disabilities. The findings will also support the development or enhancement of park standards at all levels of government.

We document an overview of methodologies developed and deployed in the Myanmar Snakebite Project, a foreign aid project largely funded by the Australian Government, with the core aim to \\"improve outcomes for snakebite patients\\". A multidisciplinary team of experts was assembled that worked in a collaborative manner with colleagues in Myanmar, first to identify problems related to managing snakebite and then develop interventions aimed to improve selected problem areas. A broad approach was adopted, covering antivenom production, antivenom distribution and health system management of snakebite. Problems identified in antivenom production included poor snake husbandry resulting in poor survival of captive specimens, lack of geographical diversity; poor horse husbandry, resulting in high mortality, inadequate stock acquisition protocols and data collection, and inappropriate immunisation and bleeding techniques; and inadequate production capacity for freeze dried antivenoms and quality control systems. These problems were addressed in various ways, resulting in some substantial improvements. Antivenom distribution is being reorganised to achieve better availability and utilisation of stock. Health system management of snakebite was assessed across all levels within the area selected for the study, in Mandalay region. A comprehensive community survey indicated that hospital statistics substantially underestimated the snakebite burden, and that access to care by local villagers was delayed by transport and cost issues compounded by lack of antivenom at the most peripheral level of the health service. A health system survey confirmed under-resourcing at the local village level. Prospective case data collection initiated at tertiary hospitals indicated the extent of the snakebite burden on health resources. Interventions initiated or planned include training of health staff, development of a core of senior trainers who can \\"train the trainers\\" nationwide in a sustainable way, development and deployment of management guidelines and algorithms for snakebite and a distribution of solar powered fridges to remote health facilities to allow storage of antivenom and prompt treatment of snakebite cases before transfer to major hospitals, thereby reducing the \\"bite to needle\\" time.","output":"A comprehensive approach to managing a neglected, neglected tropical disease; The Myanmar Snakebite Project (MSP)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While leading to millions of people's deaths every year the treatment of viral infectious diseases remains a huge public health challenge.Therefore, an in-depth understanding of human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as the molecular interface between a virus and its host cell is of paramount importance to obtain new insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections and development of antiviral therapeutic treatments. However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference.

However, the effect of CVP on critically ill AKI patients remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between CVP and all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with AKI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and retrospectively analyzed. The all-cause mortality for up to 90 days was the main observed outcome. We used the minimum CVP value obtained during the first 72 hours after ICU admission for our analysis and patients were grouped according to this parameter. Patients were also analyzed after being further divided according to stages 1, 2 and 3 of AKI. Multiple Cox regression and KaplanCMeier analyses were used to explore the association between CVP measurements and death of ICU patients with AKI. RESULTS: A total of 1986 ICU patients with AKI were studied. A total of 527 (26.5%) patients died by day 90. The high CVP group (patients with 10 mmHg) had the lowest 90-day survival rate (P =0.001 by log rank test) when according to KaplanCMeier analysis. By using Cox regression analysis, high CVP was found to be linked to an increase in mortality (CVP 10 mmHg versus 5 mmHg, HR, 1.336, 95% CI, 1.064 to 1.677, P trend=0.014). Furthermore, when using in a multivariate Cox regression analysis with CVP as a continuous variable, the higher CVP levels were still an independent risk factor for 90-day all-cause mortality (per 1 mmHg increase, HR, 1.031, 95% CI, 1.013C1.049, P=0.001). In subgroup analysis, a similar trend was observed in patients with AKI stages 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: The minimum CVP level during the first 72h after ICU admission was positively associated with mortality in critically ill patients with AKI and this more marked in cases with severe AKI.","output":"Association Between the Central Venous Pressure and All-Cause Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China and has spread through other provinces and countries through infected travelers. On January 23(rd), 2020, China issued a quarantine and travel ban on Wuhan because travelers from Wuhan were thought to account for the majority of exported COVID-19 cases to other countries. Additionally, countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan after institution of the travel ban. Together, these two populations account for the vast majority of the total cases with travel history to China as designated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current study aims to assess the prevalence and risk of COVID-19 among international travelers and evacuees of Wuhan. We first used case reports from Japan, Singapore, and Korea to investigate the date of flights of infected travelers. We then used airline traveler data and the number of infected exported cases to correlate the cases with the number of travelers for multiple countries. Our findings suggest that the risk of COVID-19 infection is highest among Wuhan travelers between January 19(th) and 22(nd), 2020, with an approximate infection rate of up to 1.3% among international travelers. We also observed that evacuee infection rates varied heavily between countries and propose that the timing of the evacuation and COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic evacuees played significant roles in the infection rates among evacuees. These findings suggest COVID-19 cases and infectivity are much higher than previous estimates, including numbers from the WHO and the literature, and that some estimates of the infectivity of COVID-19 may need re-assessment.","output":"Estimating the prevalence and risk of COVID-19 among international travelers and evacuees of Wuhan through modeling and case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of studiesincluding our ownfind a mid-life dip in well-being.

However, it is unclear whether these age-related changes impact all speech channels to the same extent, and whether they originate from a sensory or a cognitive source. The current study adopted a psychophysical approach to directly compare young and older adults sensory thresholds for emotion recognition in two channels of spoken-emotions: prosody (tone) and semantics (words). A total of 29 young adults and 26 older adults listened to 50 spoken sentences presenting different combinations of emotions across prosody and semantics. They were asked to recognize the prosodic or semantic emotion, in separate tasks. Sentences were presented on the background of speech-spectrum noise ranging from SNR of ?15 dB (difficult) to +5 dB (easy). Individual recognition thresholds were calculated (by fitting psychometric functions) separately for prosodic and semantic recognition. Results indicated that: (1). recognition thresholds were better for young over older adults, suggesting an age-related general decrease across channels; (2). recognition thresholds were better for prosody over semantics, suggesting a prosodic advantage; (3). importantly, the prosodic advantage in thresholds did not differ between age groups (thus a sensory source for age-related differences in spoken-emotions processing was not supported); and (4). larger failures of selective attention were found for older adults than for young adults, indicating that older adults experienced larger difficulties in inhibiting irrelevant information. Taken together, results do not support a sole sensory source, but rather an interplay of cognitive and sensory sources for age-related differences in spoken-emotions processing.","output":"Age-Related Changes in the Perception of Emotions in Speech: Assessing Thresholds of Prosody and Semantics Recognition in Noise for Young and Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Typus Melancholicus (TM) is the premorbid personality of endogenous depression defined by Tellenbach and Kraus and characterized by orderliness, conscientiousness, norm orientation and intolerance of ambiguity. Tellenbach's hypothesis was to find around 50% of TM in the sample of patients with an Unipolar Depression (UD). The present paper aims to make a literature review on the relationship between the Typus Melancholicus (TM) and Unipolar Depression (UD). METHODS: Nineteen references were selected through searches on PubMed, Google Scholar and Sciences-Direct with the following MeSH terms in the title: Typus Melancholicus AND Depressive or Depression or Dpression or Depressione. Nine of them were selected for our review. RESULTS: Eight of the nine reviewed articles confirm Tellenbach's hypothesis. The literature review also shows that, in a population of UD, TM is always constant regardless of age or sex, has no relationship to clinical characteristics and could contribute to the chronicity of depression. The TM with depression have increased levels of \\"lack of vital drive\\" and \\"feelings of guilt\\" and low scores in irritability and dysphoria compared to Non-Typus Melancholicus (NTM). Due to its characteristics, TM could also be involved in some pathologies such as burnout or postpartum depression. TM does not seem to be linked to a particular Personality Disorder or maladaptive personality, but the two may coexist in certain circumstances. It has been suggested that specific psychotherapeutic methods can be used to treat TM with UD. CONCLUSIONS: The TM could be very useful in our clinical practice.

We evaluate prevalence and predictors of uninsured status among CLD adults, and secondarily, how this affects documented immunity or vaccination for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: Using 2011 - 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, self-reported insurance status was determined among adults with CLD. Prevalence of uninsured status was stratified by patient characteristics and evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. Prevalence of self-reported completion of vaccination as well as laboratory value-based documented immunity to HAV and HBV was stratified by insurance status. Results: Overall, 19.0% of adults with CLD reported having no insurance, which was highest among individuals of Hispanic ethnicity (33.5%), less than high school education (33.7%), and below poverty status (35.3%). On multivariable analyses, significantly lower odds of having any insurance coverage was observed in men, Hispanics, and individuals with lower education and lower household income. Prevalence of documented immunity or vaccination for HAV was low across all insurance categories, ranging from 46.5% to 54.0%. Prevalence of documented immunity or vaccination for HBV was similarly low across all insurance categories, ranging from 24.3% to 40.8%. Conclusion: Prevalence of uninsured status among CLD was more than twice the US adult population, and lack of insurance particularly impacted Hispanics and individuals with low education and low household income.

These tests can be utilized as a complementary method in diagnosis and patients' follow-up, and can also be helpful in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to describe temporal changes in the incidence of COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies in emergency medical technicians (EMTs) within a specified time period. METHODS: All EMTs working for Tehran Emergency Medical Service (EMS) center during May to September 2020 were eligible for this study. Those EMTs who were suspected/probable/confirmed cases of COVID-19, based on WHO defined criteria and were willing to participate, entered the study. The EMTs underwent serology testing four weeks after the occurrence of exposure (in suspected cases) or onset of their symptoms (in probable/confirmed cases). Cases were further confirmed by RT-PCR and/or lung CT, and antibody testing was performed for the second and third time with 12-week intervals. Finger-stick blood sampling was utilized for the specimen collection in three different phases. Samples were then analyzed by a commercial immunochromatography-based kit for qualitative measurement of serum IgM and IgG antibodies against the COVID-19 S-protein antigen. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-four participants met the inclusion criteria; their mean age was 35.9 (SD = 7.6) years and consisted of 244 (85.9%) males.

At baseline, 162 (57%) patients were seronegative, 27 (9.5%) were only positive for IgG, 3 (1.1%) were only positive for IgM, and 92 (32.4%) were positive for both antibodies; Seventy-eight (54.9%) were seronegative, and 31 (21.8%) were positive for both antibodies in the second phase; These values were 85 (69.6%) and 8 (6.6%) for the third phase, respectively. Among the people who were positive IgG in the first phase (80 people), 56.3% were still positive in the second phase and 27.5% in both subsequent phases.

This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region.

The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across >205 nations, including the United States (US). Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally. Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors. While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature. COVID-19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible. It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids. GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions.

We aimed to investigate survival rates, clinical outcomes and costs of anti-TNF agents in a large population of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS Health insurance data from 22,082 IBD patients were provided by Achmea Healthcare. Time to anti-TNF discontinuation, treatment intensification, corticosteroid initiation and hospitalisation were analysed in patients starting on anti-TNF treatment from January 2008 until December 2014. Treatment regimens were analysed at different time points. RESULTS In this cohort, 855 and 1199 subjects started infliximab and adalimumab treatment, respectively. The median time to anti-TNF discontinuation was 600 days (IQR 156-1693). The proportion of subjects receiving intensified treatment increased over time (infliximab at 3 vs. 24 months: 22.2% vs. 33.6%, p = 0.01; adalimumab at 3 vs. 24 months: 10.5% vs. 19.3%, p < 0.001). Cessation of anti-TNF treatment was less common in Crohn's disease patients (HR 0.79, p = 0.001) and in patients receiving intensified treatment (HR 0.62, p = 0.001). Immunomodulator use was associated with a longer time to corticosteroid initiation (HR 0.80, p = 0.048), but not with longer drug survival (HR 0.99, p = 0.617). Hospitalisation was more common in Crohn's patients (HR 1.49, p = 0.011). Corticosteroid initiation was lower in Crohn's patients (HR 0.57, p < 0.001) and in patients using infliximab (HR 0.55, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy occurred earlier than previously reported and was associated with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and non-intensified anti-TNF treatment.

We aimed to assess the population-level reduction in cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases, hospitalizations, and mortality due to the BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign in Israel during JanuaryCFebruary 2021. METHODS: A susceptible-infected-recovered/removed (SIR) model and a Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) statistical approach were used. Daily counts of individuals who tested positive and of vaccine doses administered, obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health, were used to calibrate the model. The model was parameterized using values derived from a previous phase of the pandemic during which similar lockdown and other preventive measures were implemented in order to take into account the effect of these prevention measures on COVID-19 spread. RESULTS: Our model predicted for the total population a reduction of 648 585 SARS-CoV-2 cases (75% confidence interval [CI], 25 877C1 396 963) during the first 2 months of the vaccination campaign. The number of averted hospitalizations for moderate to severe conditions was 16 101 (75% CI, 2010C33 035), and reduction of death was estimated at 5123 (75% CI, 388C10 815) fatalities. Among children aged 0C19 years, we estimated a reduction of 163 436 (75% CI, 0C433 233) SARS-CoV-2 cases, which we consider to be an indirect effect of the vaccine.

Exercise is a core recommended treatment. Most evidence is based on muscle-strengthening exercise, but aerobic physical activity has potential to enhance clinical benefits. The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding aerobic physical activity to a muscle strengthening exercise leads to significantly greater reduction in hip pain and improvements in physical function, compared to a lower-limb muscle strengthening exercise program alone at 3 months. METHODS: This is a superiority, 2-group, parallel randomised controlled trial including 196 people with symptomatic hip OA from the community. Following baseline assessment, participants are randomly allocated to receive either i) aerobic physical activity and muscle strengthening exercise or; ii) muscle strengthening exercise only. Participants in both groups receive 9 consultations with a physiotherapist over 3 months. Both groups receive a progressive muscle strengthening exercise program in addition to advice about OA management. The aerobic physical activity plan includes a prescription of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity with a goal of attaining 150 min per week. Primary outcomes are self-reported hip pain assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain possible) and self-reported physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function subscale) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include other measures of self-reported pain (assessed at 0, 3, 9 months), self-reported physical function (assessed at 0, 3, 9 months), performance-based physical function (assessed at 0, 3 months), joint stiffness (assessed at 0, 3, 9 months), quality of life (assessed at 0, 3, 9 months), muscle strength (assessed at 0, 3 months), and cardiorespiratory fitness (assessed at 0, 3 months). Other measures include adverse events, co-interventions, and adherence. Measures of body composition, serum inflammatory biomarkers, quantitative sensory measures, anxiety, depression, fear of movement and self-efficacy are included to explore causal mechanisms. DISCUSSION: Findings will assist to provide an evidence-based recommendation regarding the additional effect of aerobic physical activity to lower-limb muscle strengthening on hip OA pain and physical function.

Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. METHODS: Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. RESULTS: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P>.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P<.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P<.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19.

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and research gaps: Understanding SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor and implications for therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Posttranslational modifications of cellular proteins by covalent conjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like polypeptides regulate numerous cellular processes that are captured by viruses to promote infection, replication, and spreading.

While CMA has the potential to accelerate patient access, the perceived value at the regulatory level may not translate to value at the health technology assessment (HTA) level. This research explores whether CMA can accelerate time to patient access while maintaining optimal reimbursement outcomes. Methods: HTA outcomes of medicines with CMA from 2018-2020 were analysed, followed by 30-minute, qualitative, in-depth interviews with payer advisors from France and Germany to predict the evolution of HTA frameworks to accommodate future CMA candidates. Results: 22 medicines received CMA from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2018-2020. Despite substantial unmet medical need across indications, CMA translated to poor HTA outcomes. Of 18 available HTAs in France, 8 medicines received a negative reimbursement recommendation of SMR Insufficient (in primary indication or subgroup), while the remaining outcomes were split between Important, Moderate and Low. Most of the reimbursed medicines demonstrated poor quality of evidence, and received ASMR V. Of 13 available HTAs in Germany, only one medicine achieved an added benefit rating, while most demonstrated no or non-quantifiable added benefit. Payers expect future CMA candidates will face similar reimbursement hurdles if market-specific HTA requirements are not met. Conclusions: While CMA accelerates regulatory approval, limited data packages create huge uncertainty in the appraisal of medicines. This leads to significant risk of unfavourable reimbursement outcomes and delays in patient access. While HTA frameworks continue to evolve over time, they are unlikely to reward immature data submissions particularly as payer bodies face ever-increasing funding constraints likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The respective enzymes are thus excellent targets for antiviral intervention. In cell culture, activation of Ebola virus, as well as SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can be accomplished by the endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB). In addition, SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can use serine proteases localized at the cell surface, for their activation. However, it is currently unclear which protease(s) facilitate viral spread in the infected host.

K11777 is already in advanced stages of development for a number of parasitic diseases, such as Chagas disease, and has proven to be safe and effective in a range of animal models. K11777 inhibition of SARS-CoV and Ebola virus entry was observed in the sub-nanomolar range. In order to assess, whether cysteine or serine proteases promote viral spread in the host, we compared the antiviral activity of an optimized K11777-derivative with that of camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and related serine proteases. Employing a pathogenic animal model of SARS-CoV infection, we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is driven by serine rather than cysteine proteases and can be effectively prevented by camostat. Camostat has been clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis, and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory coronavirus infections.

A particular increase in H3K79 methylation was observed and the use of an inhibitor of the specific H3K79 methylase, Dot1L enzyme, or its silencing, increased influenza virus replication.

The data suggested a control of antiviral signaling by methylation of H3K79 and consequently, influenza virus replication was unaffected in IFN pathway-compromised, Dot1L-inhibited cells. H3K79 methylation also controlled replication of another potent interferon-inducing virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus, but did not modify amplification of respiratory syncytial virus that poorly induces interferon signaling.

For the preparation of our interview guide and data analysis, we employed the WHO conceptual framework of socioeconomic determinants of health. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 health professionals and policymakers who were chosen using a purposive sampling approach. MAXQDA-18 software was used to analyze the data. The Goba and Lincoln criteria were used to assess the quality of the results. RESULTS: There are 23 subcategories and 9 categories, which include socio-economic and political context (unstable macroeconomic environment, poor management of the pandemic, media and knowledge transfer), cultural and social values (fatalism, cultural norms, value conflicts, social customs), socio-economic positions (livelihood conditions), social capital (social cohesion, low trust), living conditions (housing conditions), occupational conditions (precarious employment), individual characteristics (demographic characteristics, personality traits, COVID-19 knowledge, and attitude), psycho-social factors (normalization of the disease, social pressure, and stigma), and health system leadership (health system problems, not taking evidence-based decisions, non-comprehensive preventive guidelines, non-operational guidelines, inadequate executive committee) were obtained.

In this work we designed an RBD multimer with the purpose of increasing its immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric 170 kDa protein. Such particles were used to vaccinate mice with two doses 30 days apart. When the particles ratio of RBD to BLS units was high (6C7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer in average), the humoral immune response was significantly higher than that elicited by RBD alone or by RBD-BLS particles with a lower RBD to BLS ratio (1C2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, multimeric particles with a high number of RBD copies elicited a high titer of neutralizing IgGs. These results indicate that multimeric particles composed of RBD covalent coupled to BLS possess an advantageous architecture for antigen presentation to the immune system, and therefore enhancing RBD immunogenicity.

High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle. Thus, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Therefore, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that a1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background \\"noise\\". Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.ImportanceThe pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, are not fully understood. In particular, relatively little is known why some individuals develop life-threatening or persistent COVID-19. Recent studies identified host-virus chimeric (HVC) reads in RNA-sequencing data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and suggested that HVC events support potential \\"human genome invasion\\" and \\"integration\\" by SARS-CoV2. This suggestion has fueled concerns about the long-term effects of current mRNA vaccines that incorporate elements of the viral genome. SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that does not encode a reverse transcriptase and does not include a nuclear phase in its life cycle, so some doubts have rightfully been expressed regarding the authenticity of HVCs and the role played by endogenous retrotransposons in this phenomenon. Thus, it is important to independently authenticate these HVC events. Here we provide several evidences suggesting that the observed HVC events are likely artifactual.","output":"Host-virus chimeric events in SARS-CoV2 infected cells are infrequent and artifactual"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore trends in the burden from stroke associated with home quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic Patients with a first-ever stroke registered between January 1 and April 20 from 2010 to 2020 were included in this study We compared the incidence and the rates of mortality, hospitalization, and diagnosis by neuroimaging for first-ever stroke among a low-income population in rural China during the study periods Overall, 377 first-ever stroke patients were analyzed in this study period;men accounted for 59 2% Compared with 2019, the incidence of first-ever stroke was 73 5% lower in 2020 (P &lt; 0 001) The incidence of first-ever stroke was lower by 64 18% in 2020 than in the previous 5 years (P = 0 002) and by 65 42% in 2020 than in the previous 10 years (P = 0 001) Mortality from first-ever stroke in 2020 was not significantly different from that in 2019, but it was noticeably lower than that for the previous 5 and 10 years However, rates of hospitalization and diagnosis by neuroimaging remained stable across the study period These findings suggest that the home quarantine helped reduce outdoor activities at low temperatures, restrict gatherings, reduce alcoholism and high-fat diet, and lower pollution caused by factories These changes were advantageous for helping high-risk groups to reduce the burden of stroke","output":"A Sharp Decline in Burden of Stroke in Rural China During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary describes the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand and the effects of the pandemic on mental health of Thais as well as potential strategies for dealing with the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand.

Several types of barbed sutures are available, each with unique advantages. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to determine whether the incidence of complications differed after wound approximation in plastic surgery when various brands of barbed vs nonbarbed traditional sutures were employed. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of outcomes in body contouring, free flap, and breast reconstruction. Suture type and closure method were noted for each case. The number of complications after traditional 2-layer closure with nonbarbed sutures was compared with the number of complications after closure via 1- and 2-layer techniques with several brands of barbed sutures, and the brands of barbed sutures were compared with each other. RESULTS A total of 1011 unique surgical procedures, including 298 procedures with barbed sutures and 713 procedures with nonbarbed sutures, were performed by 5 members of the plastic surgery faculty. The 2-layer technique with barbed sutures was associated with significantly higher rates of wound separation than traditional methods. Excessive erythema along the incision site was significantly more frequent with Quill barbed sutures than with V-Loc barbed sutures. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures were associated with significantly higher rates of minor wound complications, specifically when the 2-layer closure technique was performed.

METHODS This is a retrospective study conducted in a pediatric HSCT unit in Curitiba, Brazil between February 2013 and December 2017 that evaluated 109 pediatric patients. The variables analyzed were: age, gender, baseline disease, type of transplantation, infection topography, etiologic agent, time of HAI occurrence, antimicrobial prophylaxis, period of neutropenia, length of stay, and outcomes. RESULTS Out of 113 HSCT procedures, 91 (83.5%) were allogenic and 18 autologous (16.5%). The mean age of the patients was 7.9 years, with an median of 8.1 years (4.0 months-17.3 years); 71 (65.1%) were male; 55 (50.5%) presented with an oncologic diagnosis, 32 (29.4%) with a hematological diagnosis, 17 (15.6%) with immunodeficiencies, and 5 (4.6%) with other causes. During hospitalization after HSCT, 86 episodes of HAI were detected in 66 patients, with an infection density of 16.5 infections/1000 patient days, 86% of which occurred after allogeneic transplants, appearing, on average, 15.3 days after transplantation. The main topographies were bloodstream infection (BSI), with 24 (27.9%) cases, and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), with 11 (12.8%). Gram-positive bacteria predominated in cultures and HAI was more frequent in patients diagnosed with immunodeficiencies and other non-oncologic and non-hematologic conditions. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main agent identified (77.7%), possibly due to colonization. However, Gram-negative bacteria, with a resistance profile, comprised 40% of the cases of bacterial infections, most of them represented by Klebsiella pneumoniae (66.6%). Out of the 66 patients who presented HAI, 59 patients (89.4%) were discharged and 7 (10.6%) died. CONCLUSION The main topographies were CLABSI and BSI.

We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised clinical trial at 57 centres in Brazil. We enrolled patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and at least one additional severity criteria as follows: use of oxygen supplementation of more than 4 L/min flow; use of high-flow nasal cannula; use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation; or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg via oral, nasogastric, or intravenous administration once daily for 10 days) plus standard of care or to standard of care without macrolides. All patients received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 10 days) because that was part of standard of care treatment in Brazil for patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome, assessed by an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation, was clinical status at day 15 after randomisation, assessed by a six-point ordinal scale, with levels ranging from 1 to 6 and higher scores indicating a worse condition (with odds ratio [OR] greater than 100 favouring the control group). The primary outcome was assessed in all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by molecular or serological testing before randomisation (ie, modified ITT [mITT] population). Safety was assessed in all patients according to which treatment they received, regardless of original group assignment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321278. FINDINGS: 447 patients were enrolled from March 28 to May 19, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed in 397 patients who constituted the mITT population, of whom 214 were assigned to the azithromycin group and 183 to the control group. In the mITT population, the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (OR 136 [95% CI 094C197], p=011). Rates of adverse events, including clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney failure, and corrected QT interval prolongation, were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, adding azithromycin to standard of care treatment (which included hydroxychloroquine) did not improve clinical outcomes. Our findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19.

We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of GI symptoms in the outpatient setting and define symptoms from onset to resolution compared to the recommended isolation guidelines. Methods: The study included all adults with a positive COVID-19 test in an outpatient setting over a 2-month period. Data were collected from electronic health records and included symptoms upon diagnosis that were followed to their resolution. Descriptive analyses used means and standard deviations or medians and inter-quartile ranges (depending on data distribution) for continuous variables and frequencies with proportions for categorical data. Mann-Whitney U tests, chi square tests, and Spearman Rho correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: We screened 1165 patients and included 299 in the study. The mean age was 47.19 years old, with women showing predominance (57.7%). No correlation was found between age and time to resolutions of GI symptoms: diarrhea (r=-0.022, n = 40, p =0.892), nausea (r=0.097, n=26, p =0.636), and vomiting (r=-0.207, n=6, p =0.694). Fever was present in 65.6% (196/299) of the patients. Diarrhea was the most prevalent GI symptom (21.1%;63/299), followed by nausea (13.4%;40/299) and vomiting (4.7%;14/299). Diarrhea was significantly more prevalent in patients with fever (25.5%;50/196) compared to patients with no fever (12.6%;13/103) [p =0.009]. Median time to resolution of GI symptoms was 17.5 days (11.75-33.25) compared to 17 days (12-23.5) for non-GI symptoms [p =0.569] (Figure 1a). Median time to resolution of diarrhea was 13 days (11-20) among smokers and 24 days (13-36) among non-smokers [p =0.042] (Figure 1b). Conclusion: No demographic data led to prolonged GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Diarrhea lasted longer in patients who had fever, increasing the risk of possible fecal-oral viral transmission. Despite its established negative impact on health, smoking was correlated with a shorter duration of diarrhea. The median symptom duration was higher than the CDCrecommended isolation time of 10 days. Despite vaccine availability, COVID-19 spread continues to pose a challenge.

We sought to address knowledge gaps regarding patient characteristics, acuity, and sequelae of COVID-19 in the paediatric cardiac ICU setting. DESIGN: Retrospective review of paediatric cardiac ICU admissions with COVID-19-related disease. SETTING: Single centre tertiary care paediatric cardiac ICU. PATIENTS: All patients with PCR/antibody evidence of primary COVID-19 infection, and/or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, were admitted between 26 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Patient-level demographics, pre-existing conditions, clinical symptoms, and outcomes related to ICU admission were captured from medical records. RESULTS: Among 1064 patients hospitalised with COVID-19/Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, 102 patients (9.5%) were admitted to cardiac ICU, 76 of which were symptomatic (median age 12.5 years [IQR 7.5-16.0]). The primary system involved at presentation was cardiovascular in 48 (63%). Vasoactive infusions were required in 62% (n = 47), with eight patients (11%) requiring VA ECMO. Severity of disease was categorised as mild/moderate in 16 (21%) and severe/critical in 60 patients (79%).

Differentiation between both origins can be difficult and characteristics such as symptom manifestations, time to relief in rest position and pain localization should be considered when determining diagnosis and the treatment plan. The objectives of this study were to compare changes in walking time to symptom change during treadmill tests and self-reported outcomes measures related to claudication, kinesophobia and global health between individuals with LSS, PAD and non-specific low back pain (nLBP). METHOD: Fifty-five patients (23 with LSS, 14 with PAD and 18 with nLBP) were recruited from May 2018 to March 2020 to complete a treadmill walking test involving two 5-min walking tasks (Upright and Forward Leaning Trunk (FLT) Walking tasks). The speed was set at 1.9 km/h (1.2 mph), and each task was followed by a 5-min rest period. Walking time to symptom change and Total walking time were recorded during each walking task. Patients were asked to complete four questionnaires related to the impact of claudication, walking impairment, kinesiophobia and global health. One-way ANOVAs were performed to compare walking time difference from the Upright to the FLT walking tasks and to compare questionnaires results between groups. RESULTS: One-way ANOVAs showed a significant difference between groups regarding difference in Walking time to symptom change between both tasks (F = 4.12, p = 0.022). The LSS group improved its Walking time to symptom change from the Upright to the FLT walking tasks more than the PAD (p = 0.34) and the nLBP group (p = 0.12). The nLBP group was less impacted by claudication and less impaired during walking compared to the LSS and PAD groups (ps < 0.001). The nLBP group also had less kinesiophobia than the LSS one (p < 0.001), but was similar to the PAD group. The global health rating was not statistically different between groups (p = 0.118). CONCLUSION: The test was able to distinguish neurogenic from vascular or nLBP related claudication. However, further studies are needed to validate this new treadmill walking test.

Surface ACE2 expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured with flow cytometry. p50 was knocked down with siRNA. Cytotoxicity was monitored by PARP cleavage and MTS assay. KEY FINDINGS: Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-&#954;B inhibitor, suppressed endogenous ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. The ROS level in H322M cells was increased after PDTC treatment, and pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reversed PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression. Meanwhile, treatment with hydrogen peroxide augmented ACE2 suppression in H322M cells with p50 knockdown.

Infectious diseases are leading causes of child mortality, and lack of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among infants aged 0C6 months increases child morbidity and mortality from various infectious diseases in developing countries. However, as per existing literature, no study has been conducted yet to determine the lack of EBF practice effect on child mortality in Bangladesh. With this backdrop, the authors intend to measure the likelihood of infectious diseases due to the lack of EBF of infants aged 0C6 months in Bangladesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data over 1996C97 to 2017C18. The mothers of infants aged 0C6 months who were willingly participated in the BDHSs were considered to include in our analysis. Initially, there were 9,133 cases in the combined dataset. After filtering, there were 5,724 cases in the final dataset. We have considered diarrhea (D), acute respiratory infection (ARI) separately as well as the presence of either D or ARI or both and named as CoDARI as outcome variables. This study used both graphical and statistical techniques (Chi-square test, Wald test, and logistic regression) to analyze the data. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to quantify the likelihood of infectious diseases due to lack of EBF practice and its elasticity, respectively. RESULTS: The EBF practice got a conspicuous increasing trend, but the prevalence of infectious diseases was declined from 0 to 3 months of age of infants, whereas an inverse scenario is observed between 4C6 months. The significance of that inverse relationship was confirmed by p-value corresponding to the chi-square test and the Wald test of the adjusted regression coefficients after adjusting the associated factors effect on infectious diseases. The adjusted ORs also concluded that the lack of EBF practice up to six months of age could enhance the risk of D, ARI, and CoDARI by 2.11 [95% CI: 1.56C2.85], 1.43 [95% CI: 1.28C1.60], and 1.48 [95% CI: 1.32C1.66] times higher, respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study emphasize the importance of EBF up to six months of age of infants against diarrhea and ARI specific morbidity and mortality. Our results also agreed to the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and National Nutrition Programme of Ethiopia (NNPE) that the EBF practice for the first six months of age could be a best, cost-effective, long-lasting natural preventive way to reduce the child morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases in developing countries.

Significant differences were noticed in body weight changes and cardiovascular problems between the two groups: body weight increase (22.6% vs. 10.2%), body weight decrease (3.2% vs. 6.7%), worsening of cardiovascular problems (35.5% vs. 17.9%) in the unstable and stable blood pressure groups, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis reflected the impact of the increase in body weight and occurrence of cardiovascular problems on the patients with unstable blood pressure.

METHOD AND RESULTS: Multi-centre, observational, cohort study over a 100-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) in the USA. Remote monitoring was used to assess AF episodes in patients with a CIED (pacemaker or defibrillator; 20 centres, 13 states). For comparison, the identical 100-day period in 2019 was used (Control). The primary outcomes were the AF burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the association of the pandemic with AF occurrence, as compared with 1 year prior. The secondary outcome was the association of AF occurrence with per-state COVID-19 prevalence. During COVID-19, 10 346 CIEDs with an atrial lead were monitored. There were 16 570 AF episodes of &#8805;6 min transmitted (16 events per 1000 patient days) with a significant increase in proportion of patients with AF episodes in high COVID-19 prevalence states compared with low prevalence states [odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.48, P < 0.001]. There were significantly more AF episodes during COVID-19 compared with Control [incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P < 0.001]. This relationship persisted for AF episodes &#8805;1 h (IRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.53-1.79, P < 0.001) and &#8805;6 h (IRR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the first 100 days of COVID-19, a 33% increase in AF episodes occurred with a 34% increase in the proportion of patients with AF episodes observed in states with higher COVID-19 prevalence.

No available data exist so far regarding safety, efficacy and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitude to COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: A survey was made at University of Naples Federico II and University of Rome Tor Vergata Ospedale Cristo Re on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes towards the SARS-COV-2 vaccination. Chi square (&#967;2) or Fisher exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020), and University of Rome Tor Vergata Ospedale Cristo Re (ref. #Ost4-2020). RESULTS: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive SARS-COV-2 vaccine during pregnancy (40, 28.2% vs 102, 71.8%). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99, 69.7% vs 43, 30.3%; &#967;2= 24.187, p<0.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128, 90.1% vs 14, 9.9%; &#967;2= 6.091, p=0.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75, 52.8% vs 67, 47.2%; &#967;2= 10.996, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Urgent data are needed on safety, efficacy and toxicology of SARS-COV-2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counselling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty.","output":"Pregnant women perspectives on SARS-COV-2 vaccine: Condensation: Most of Italian pregnant women would not agree to get the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, irrespective of having features of high risk themselves, or being high-risk pregnancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a cost-effective, scalable technology to produce SARS-COV-2 spike (S) protein based on stable expression in HEK293 cells, and its use to develop a highly specific and sensitive ELISA test.

Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and GBS, but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDx) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59 years), gender (65% male), and COVID-19 features appeared to reflect those of hospitalized COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non-COVID-19 GBS. The EDx pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all cases. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most cases. GBS-associated COVID-19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDx patterns to GBS before the pandemic.

Forty-six (16%) samples were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with CRC, compared with 26 (9.1%) in the healthy controls, a significant difference (P = 0.007). By contrast, eight (2.8%) patients tested positive for T. gondii IgM antibodies, compared with three (1.1%) in the controls, a difference that was not significant (P = 0.13).

However, empirical evidence is inconclusive regarding how SSAs international migration progressed and reacted during its march to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article attempts to study the patterns and determinants of SSAs international migration and the cause and effects on sustainable development by developing a Sustainability Index and regression models. We find that international migration was primarily intra-SSA to low-income but high-population-density countries. Along with increased sustainability scores, international migration declined, but emigration rose. Climate extremes tend to affect migration and emigration but not universally. Dry extremes propelled migration, whereas wet extremes had an adverse effect. Hot extremes had an increasing effect but were insignificant. SSAs international migration was driven by food insecurity, low life expectancy, political instability and violence, high economic growth, unemployment, and urbanisation rates. The probability of emigration was mainly driven by high fertility. SSAs international migration promoted asylum seeking to Europe with the diversification of origin countries and a motive for economic wellbeing. 1% more migration flow or 1% higher probability of emigration led to a 0.2% increase in asylum seekers from SSA to Europe. Large-scale international migration and recurrent emigration constrained SSAs sustainable development in political stability, food security, and health, requiring adequate governance and institutions for better migration management and planning towards the SDGs.

It is not known whether older adults are accessing emergency care differently from their younger counterparts. Our objective was to determine patterns of ED visit counts for emergent conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Observational analysis of ED sites enrolled in a national clinical quality registry. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-four ED sites in 33 states from January 1, 2019 to November 15, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We measured daily ED visit counts for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, sepsis, fall, and hip fracture, as well as deaths in the ED, by age categories. We estimated Poisson regression models comparing early and post-early pandemic periods (defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to the pre-pandemic period. We report incident rate ratios to summarize changes in visit incidence. RESULTS: For AMI, stroke, and sepsis, the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years) had the greatest decline in visit counts initially and the smallest recovery in the post-early pandemic periods. For falls, visits declined early and partially recovered uniformly across age categories. In contrast, hip fractures exhibited less change in visit rates across time periods. Deaths in the ED increased during the early pandemic period, but then fell and were persistently lower than baseline, especially for the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years). CONCLUSIONS: The decline in ED visits for emergent conditions among older adults has been more pronounced and persistent than for younger patients, with fewer deaths in the ED. This is concerning given the greater prevalence and risk of poor outcomes for emergent conditions in this age group that are amenable to time-sensitive ED diagnosis and treatment, and may in part explain excess mortality during the COVID-19 era among older adults.","output":"Emergency department visits for emergent conditions among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses are among the most prevalent pathogens and are a major burden on society.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, devastating the social, economic and political aspects of life. Many clinicians, health professionals, scientists, organizations, and governments have actively defeated COVID-19 and shared their experiences of the SARS-CoV2. Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for fatal outcomes from COVID-19. Patients with diabetes are vulnerable to infection because of hyperglycemia; impaired immune function; vascular complications; and comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Hence, the use of angiotensin-directed medications in patients with diabetes requires attention.

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters, including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the value of correlating clinical, epidemiological and genomic information for the understanding of viral evolution and its spatial distribution over time.

Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can cross-bind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD.

A hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is the low presence of IFN proteins in patient serum despite elevated levels of IFN-encoding mRNAs, indicative of post-transcriptional inhibition of IFN protein production. Here, we performed single-molecule RNA visualization to examine the expression and localization of host mRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the biogenesis of type I and type III IFN mRNAs is inhibited at multiple steps during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, translocation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factor to the nucleus is limited in response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits RLR-MAVS signaling and thus weakens transcriptional induction of IFN genes. Second, we observed that IFN mRNAs primarily localize to the site of transcription in most SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 either inhibits the release of IFN mRNAs from their sites of transcription and/or triggers decay of IFN mRNAs in the nucleus upon exiting the site of transcription. Lastly, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of IFN mRNAs is inhibited during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which we propose is a consequence of widespread degradation of host cytoplasmic basal mRNAs in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein, as well as the host antiviral endoribonuclease, RNase L.

DESIGN: This study used a qualitative application of the theory of planned behaviour to examine underlying beliefs that may influence workers intentions to participate in mental health literacy programmes delivered by community organisations and manager support for them. SETTING: This study took place within three large white-collar organisations in the Australian state of Victoria. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen workers and 11 managers (n=29) were interviewed to explore perspectives of the benefits of such an approach. RESULTS: Community organisations have six attributes that make them suitable as an alternative mental health literacy programme provider including empathy, safety, relatability, trustworthiness, social support and inclusivity. Behavioural beliefs included accessibility, understanding and objectivity. The lack of suitability and legitimacy due to poor governance and leadership was disadvantages. Normative beliefs were that family and friends would most likely approve, while line managers and colleagues were viewed as most likely to disapprove. Control beliefs indicated that endorsements from relevant bodies were facilitators of participation. Distance/time constraints and the lack of skills, training and lived experiences of coordinators/facilitators were seen as barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying workers beliefs and perceptions of community organisations has significant implication for the development of effective community-based strategies to improve worker mental health literacy and help seeking. Organisations with formal governance structures, allied with government, peak bodies and work-related mental health organisations would be most suitable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 18 male rats were used and divided into three groups according to age. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to determine the levels of the quantification of eosinophil cationic protein mRNA transcript. In addition, tissue specimens of the lung were stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin stains. RESULTS: This study confirmed that RT-qPCR amplification plots of ACE2 gene exhibited clearly expression of the lung tissue of rats in the different groups and there are strong different threshold cycles numbers according to the age at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6-8 months. Consequently, the expression of ACE2 was completely different between groups depending on the age of the rats. The RT-qPCR results showed that the older animal group (age of 6-8 months) had a significantly higher expression of ACE2 than the other animal groups (ages of 2 weeks and 2 months). In the same way, the second group (age of 2 months) had a significantly higher expression of ACE2 than the first group (age of 2 weeks). This study confirmed that the ACE2 expression is influenced by the age of rats. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that the expression of the ACE2 receptor of coronavirus disease 2019 would be different according to the age of rats, and this result suggested that expression of ACE2 in lung tissue could determine infection and pathogenesis of COVID-19 during different ages of rats or some individual differences.","output":"mRNA expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the lung tissue of Wistar rats according to age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoporous poly(4-fluorostyrene) templates on gold-coated silicon/silicon oxide substrates were prepared by the electric field alignment of poly(4-fluorostyrene)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) block copolymer thin films followed by mild degradation of the polylactide phase using dilute aqueous base.

This article presents new ways for low-income and middle-income countries to gain more control of their development assistance programming as they move towards universal health coverage (UHC). We base our findings on the experience of the African Collaborative for Health Financing Solutions (ACS), an innovative US Agency for International Development-funded project. The ACS project stems from the premise that the global health community can more effectively support UHC processes in countries if development partners change three long-standing paradigms: (1) time-limited projects to enhancing long-lasting processes, (2) fly-in/fly-out development support to leveraging and strengthening local and regional expertise and (3) static knowledge creation to supporting practical and co-developed resources that enhance learning and capture implementation experience. We assume that development partners can facilitate progress towards UHC if interventions follow five action steps, including (1) align to country demand, (2) provide evidence-based and tailored health financing technical support, (3) respond to knowledge and learnings throughout activity design and implementation, (4) foster multi-stakeholder collaboration and ownership and (5) strengthen accountability mechanisms. Since 2017, the ACS project has applied these five action steps in its implementing countries, including Benin, Namibia and Uganda.

METHODS: A centralized contact tracing system was developed to support data linkage, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and follow-up of contacts' health status. We illustrated the process of how digital tools support contact tracing and management of COVID-19 cases and measured the timeliness from case detection to contact monitoring to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: Among the 8051 close contacts of the 487 confirmed cases (16.5 close contacts/case, 95% CI [13.9-19.1]), the median elapsed time from last exposure to quarantine was three days (IQR 1-5). By implementing the approach of self-reporting using automatic text-messages and web-app, the percentage of health status updates from self-reporting increased from 22.5% to 61.5%. The high proportion of secondary cases detected via contact tracing (88%) might reduce the R0 to under one and minimize the impact of local transmission in the community.

To achieve herd immunity, widespread use of the vaccine is required, and it is therefore critical for government and public health agencies to understand public perceptions of the vaccine to help sustain subsequent vaccinations. ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the opinions and sentiments of tweets about COVID-19 vaccination among Twitter users in Japan, both before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination program. MethodsWe collected 144,101 Japanese tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords from Japanese Twitter users between August 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Specifically, we identified temporal changes in the number of tweets and key events that triggered a surge in the number of tweets. In addition, we performed sentiment analysis, and calculated the correlation between different sentiments and the number of deaths, infections, and vaccinations. We also built latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also provided a word cloud of high-frequency unigram and bigram tokens as additional evidence, and conducted further analysis on three different vaccine brands. ResultsThe overall number of tweets has continued to increase since the start of mass vaccination in Japan. Sentiments were generally neutral, but negative sentiment was more significant than positive sentiment. Before and after the first vaccination in Japan, the correlations of negative/positive sentiment with death, infection, and vaccination cases changed significantly. Public concerns revolved around three themes: information on vaccine reservations and vaccinations in Japan; infection and mutation of COVID-19 in Japan; and prevention measures, vaccine development and supply, and vaccination status in other countries. Furthermore, public attention to the three brands of vaccines has a temporal shift as clinical trials move forward. ConclusionsThe number of tweets and changes in sentiment might be driven by major news events in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine, with negative sentiments dominating positive sentiments overall. Death and infection cases correlated significantly with negative sentiments, but the correlation fell after vaccinations began as morbidity and mortality decreased. The publics attention to different vaccine brands had a temporal change during their clinical trial process, and although the discussion points are slightly different, the core remains effective and secure.","output":"Public Opinion and Sentiment Before and at the Beginning of COVID-19 Vaccinations in Japan: Twitter Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study a strongly adsorbed flexible polyelectrolyte chain on tori.

METHODS A Markov model was developed to simulate health outcomes and costs of two therapies over a lifetime time horizon: stent-retriever thrombectomy in combination with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV t-PA), and IV t-PA alone. The model incorporated an acute phase (0-90 days) and a rest of life phase (90+ days). Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale score. During the rest of life phase, patients remained in the same health state until a recurrent stroke or death. Clinical effectiveness and safety data were taken from the SWIFT PRIME study. Resource use and health state utilities were informed by published data. RESULTS Combined stent-retriever thrombectomy and IV t-PA led to improved quality-of-life and increased life expectancy compared to IV t-PA alone. The higher treatment costs associated with the use of stent-retriever thrombectomy were offset by long-term cost savings due to improved patient health status, leading to overall cost savings of 33 190 per patient and a net benefit of 79 402. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust to a wide range of parameter inputs. LIMITATIONS The acute and long-term costs resource use data were taken from a study based on a patient population that was older and may have had additional comorbidities than the SWIFT PRIME population, resulting in costs that may not be representative of the cohort within this model. In addition, the estimates may not reflect stroke care today as no current evidence is available; however, the cost estimates were deemed reasonable by clinical opinion.

In this cross-sectional multicenter study, we investigated sleep disturbances, and the level of anxiety and depression among the healthcare and non-healthcare staff of three hospitals in Milan (Italy) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we explored potential predisposing factors for affective symptoms and poor sleep. METHODS: Between June and July 2020, we administered an online questionnaire to evaluate the presence of sleep disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia (Sleep Condition Indicator), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II). We used univariate and multivariate analysis to evaluate the association between the personal conditions and sleep and affective disorders. RESULTS: The 964 participants reported high rates of sleep disorders (80.3%)mainly insomnia (30.5%)anxiety (69.7%), and depression (32.8%). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association of sleep disorders, especially insomnia, with female gender (p = 0.004), divorced marital status (p = 0.015), self-isolation (p = 0.037), and chronic diseases (p = 0.003). Anxiety was significantly associated with teleworking (p = 0.001), while depressive symptoms were associated with self-isolation (p = 0.028), modified work schedules (p = 0.03), and chronic diseases (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: In hospital workers, the high prevalence of sleep and psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak appears to be determined mainly by modifications of personal or work habits.

As of mid-January 2021, there are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. The main protease (Mpro) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the Mpro has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the Mpro in complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, N3 and &#945;-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. Our results indicate that the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the Mpro target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the Mpro than the &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the Mpro-N3 covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the Mpro-&#945;-ketoamide covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.","output":"Covalent and non-covalent binding free energy calculations for peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19)-affected patients with severe immune abnormalities have a risk of cytokine release syndrome The definition, prevention, and treatment of symptoms of cytokine release syndrome in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are important problems This was a single-center case series of 11 COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China from January 26, 2020 to February 18, 2020 The termination date of follow-up was February 19, 2020 In this single-center analysis of 11 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 8 patients were determined to have characteristics of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including pulmonary inflammation, fever, and dysfunction of non-pulmonary organs;an increase of- Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood was the highest risk factor and an early indicator of CRS in COVID-19","output":"The Definition and Risks of Cytokine Release Syndrome in 11 COVID-19-Affected Critically Ill Patients with Pneumonia: Analysis of Disease Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I draw on the key tenets of the culture-centered approach to co-construct the everyday negotiations of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) among low-wage male Bangladeshi migrant workers in Singapore.

Aluminum oxide loaded with silver nanoparticles (AO-Ag) was proposed as SERS-active sorbent and used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analyte and its SERS-based determination (SPE-SERS protocol). MTX has strong SERS signal only in alkaline media that challenges its determination in urine due to strong background signal caused by creatinine. The application of SPE step enables to purify and concentrate the analyte making MTX determination possible. Also, the application of the same material for SPE pretreatment and SERS analysis enables to simplify and speed-up the protocol. The protocol was developed and tested using artificially spiked samples of human urine collected during different time of day to account deviating composition of the urine matrix. The use of dilution step of the analyte-containing urine was proposed prior SPE-SERS protocol to reduce the difference between morning-time- and daytime-collected urine achieving maximal reliability of the analysis. Additional physicochemical study was performed to estimate an influence of the primary intrinsic urine components (salts, urea, creatinine) and their mixtures on the analytical signal. Final protocol enables MTX determination in human urine within 20-300 g mL-1 range of concentrations with satisfactory precision (11-19% RSD), accuracy (97-104% apparent recovery), and limit of detection (4.2 g mL-1). Accounting that the analysis requires less than 15 min and portable Raman spectrometer, the protocol seems to be promising for therapeutic drug monitoring in hospitals to identify poor MTX clearance in a timely manner and minimize adverse effects of therapy.

The host density threshold is a central concept in theoretical epidemiology and a common target of human and wildlife disease control programmes, but there is mixed evidence supporting the existence of thresholds, especially in wildlife populations or for pathogens with complex transmission modes (e.g. environmental transmission). Here, we demonstrate the existence of a host density threshold for an environmentally transmitted pathogen by combining an epidemiological model with a microcosm experiment. Experimental epidemics consisted of replicate populations of naive crustacean zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) hosts across a range of host densities (20C640 hosts l(?1)) that were exposed to an environmentally transmitted fungal pathogen (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Epidemiological model simulations, parametrized independently of the experiment, qualitatively predicted experimental pathogen invasion thresholds. Variability in parameter estimates did not strongly influence outcomes, though systematic changes to key parameters have the potential to shift pathogen invasion thresholds.

METHODS: We consecutively included patients <72 hours after intubation following informed consent from next of kin. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was evaluated by microscopy and BALF and blood was assessed by 10-colored flow cytometry and a multiplex cytokine panel. RESULTS: Four mechanically ventilated patients (40-75 yr.) with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS were included. Immature neutrophils dominated in both blood and lungs, while CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphopenia were observed in the two compartments. However, T regulatory cells and Th17 cells were found in higher fractions in the lung. Lung CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages expressed an even higher upregulation of activation markers than in blood. A wide range of cytokines were expressed at high levels both in blood and in the lungs, most notably IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1, consistent with hyperinflammation.

We previously reported the successful in vitro inhibition of FIPV replication by synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in an immortalised cell line (McDonagh et al., 2011). A major challenge facing the development of any antiviral strategy is that of resistance, a problem which is particularly acute for RNAi based therapeutics due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. The development of resistance during treatment can be minimised using combination therapy to raise the genetic barrier or using highly potent compounds which result in a more rapid and pronounced reduction in the viral replication rate, thereby reducing the formation of mutant, and potentially resistant viruses. This study investigated the efficacy of combination siRNA therapy and its ability to delay or prevent viral escape. Virus serially passaged through cells treated with a single or dual siRNAs rapidly acquired resistance, with mutations identified in the siRNA target sites. Combination therapy with three siRNA prevented viral escape over the course of five passages. To identify more potent silencing molecules we also compared the efficacy, in terms of potency and duration of action, of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs for two previously identified effective viral motifs. Dicer-substrate siRNAs showed equivalent or better potency than canonical siRNAs for the target sites investigated, and may be a more appropriate molecule for in vivo use.

In the Republic of Ireland, the first national lockdown was decreed on 23(rd) of March 2020, followed by a succession of restriction increases and decreases (phases) over the following year. To date, the effects of these interventions remain unclear, and particularly within differing population subsets. The current study sought to assess the impact of individual NPI phases on COVID-19 transmission patterns within delineated population subgroups in the Republic of Ireland. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Confirmed, anonymised COVID-19 cases occurring between the 29(th) of February 2020 and 30(th) November 2020 (n = 72,654) were obtained. Segmented modelling via breakpoint regression with multiple turning points was employed to identify structural breaks across sub-populations, including primary/secondary infections, age deciles, urban/commuter/rural areas, patients with underlying health conditions, and socio-demographic profiles. These were subsequently compared with initiation dates of eight overarching NPI phases. Five distinct breakpoints were identified. The first breakpoint, associated with a decrease in the daily COVID-19 incidence, was reported within 14 days of the first set of restrictions in mid-March 2020 for most population sub-groups. Results suggest that moderately strict NPIs were more effective than the strictest Phase 5 (National Lockdown). Divergences were observed across population sub-groups; lagged response times were observed among populations >80 years, residents of rural/ commuter regions, and cases associated with a below-median deprivation score. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that many NPIs have been successful in decreasing COVID-19 incidence rates, however the strictest Phase 5 NPI was not. Moreover, NPIs were not equally successful across all sub-populations, with differing response times noted. Future strategies and interventions may need to be increasingly bespoke, based on sub-population profiles and required responses.","output":"Breakpoint modelling of temporal associations between non-pharmaceutical interventions and symptomatic COVID-19 incidence in the Republic of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TAFRO syndrome is a rare disorder that manifests as thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly.

The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their inter-nal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, tempera-ture and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season. IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation). RESULTS: During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25 g/m3), but started rising in all schools in the heating season. The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows. CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher. Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0-27,0C in non-heating;20,0-24,0C in heating season;and 45-55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools. The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools. Registered differ-ences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics. CONCLUSION: Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recom-mended values in heating season. In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom. Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings.","output":"School Children Exposure to Low Indoor Air Quality in Classrooms during Covid-19 Pandemic: Results of a Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the contemporary prevalence of and risk factors for symptomatic diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) in participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry.

At our large academic medical center, clinicians reported that existing information on distribution channels, including emails and hospital intranet posts, was inadequate to keep everyone abreast with these changes. To address these challenges, we adapted a mobile app developed in-house to communicate critical changes in hospital policies and enable direct telephonic communication between clinical team members and hospitalized patients, to support social distancing guidelines and remote rounding. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the unique benefits and challenges of adapting an app developed in-house to facilitate communication and remote rounding during COVID-19.

We monitored anonymized user activity from February 1 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS: On its first release, 1104 clinicians downloaded moblMD during the observation period, of which 46% (n=508) of downloads occurred within 72 hours of initial release. COVID-19 policies in the app were reviewed most commonly during the first week (801 views). Users made sustained use of hospital phone dialing features, including weekly peaks of 2242 phone number dials, 1874 directory searches, and 277 patient room phone number searches through the last 2 weeks of the observation period. Furthermore, clinicians submitted 56 content- and phone numberCrelated suggestions through moblMD. CONCLUSIONS: We rapidly developed and deployed a communication-focused mobile app early during COVID-19, which has demonstrated initial and sustained value among clinicians in communicating with in-patients and each other during social distancing. Our internal innovation benefited from our teams familiarity with institutional structures, short feedback loops, limited security and privacy implications, and a path toward sustainability provided by our innovation center. Challenges in content management were overcome through synchronization efforts and timestamping review. As COVID-19 continues to alter health care delivery, user activity metrics suggest that our solution will remain important in our efforts to continue providing safe and up-to-date clinical care.","output":"A Mobile App to Facilitate Socially Distanced Hospital Communication During COVID-19: Implementation Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Behavioral economics represents a promising set of principles to inform the design of health-promoting interventions. Techniques from the field have the potential to increase quality of cardiovascular care given suboptimal rates of guideline-directed care delivery and patient adherence to optimal health behaviors across the spectrum of cardiovascular care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular health-promoting interventions have demonstrated success in using a wide array of principles from behavioral economics, including loss framing, social norms, and gamification. Such approaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated and focused on clinical cardiovascular outcomes in addition to health behaviors as a primary endpoint. Many approaches can be used to improve patient decisions remotely, which is particularly useful given the shift to virtual care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Inflammatory markers are associated with risk of incident diabetes but the impact of inflammation on racial differences in incident diabetes is unknown. We assessed whether CRP mediated the Black-White incident diabetes disparity. METHODS: The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study enrolled 30,239 US Black and White adults aged 45 years in 2003-2007 with a second visit approximately 10-years later. Among participants without baseline diabetes, adjusted sex- and race-stratified risk ratios (RR) for incident diabetes at the second visit by CRP level were calculated using modified Poisson regression. Inverse odds weighting estimated the percent mediation of the racial disparity by CRP. RESULTS: Of 11,073 participants without baseline diabetes (33% Black, 67% White), 1,389 (12.5%) developed diabetes. Black participants had higher CRP at baseline and greater incident diabetes than White participants. Relative to CRP <3 mg/L, CRP 3 mg/L was associated with greater risk of diabetes in all race-sex strata. Black participants had higher risk of diabetes at CRP <3 mg/L, but not at CRP 3mg/L. In women, CRP mediated 10.0% of the racial difference in incident diabetes. This mediation was not seen in men. CONCLUSIONS: Higher CRP is a risk factor for incident diabetes, but the excess burden of diabetes in Black adults was only seen in those with lower CRP, suggesting that inflammation is unlikely to be the main driver of this racial disparity.","output":"C-reactive protein and racial differences in type 2 diabetes incidence: The REGARDS study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted by droplet and contact infection.

Stigma is a crucial factor impacting these individuals lives and their access to medical care. This study aimed to understand the experience of the stateless population in Thailand and how they overcome the problem of stigma. METHODS: A qualitative method was used to elicit information from key informants who were members of the stateless population, which was classified as those who did not hold Thai identification cards (IDs). A questionnaire was used to guide the interview, which was conducted in a private and confidential room. The interviews were conducted after voluntary agreement was obtained from the participants; each interview was held in August 2021 and lasted for approximately 45 minutes. RESULTS: Fifty-one people participated in the study; 68.6% were females, 86.3% were married, and 90.2% were Akha or Lahu. The stateless population in Thailand reported four types of perceived stigma: having a lower ability to request that their needs be met, not being equal to others, not being able to qualify for health care services and being ranked below other hill tribe people who have IDs. The phrase life is nothing was presented by the participants, who reported that they felt like an invisible population in Thailand. Some participants reported that other hill tribe people who have IDs act as stigma perpetuators among members of the stateless population who do not have IDs. Maintaining their privacy within their village, trying to obtain a Thai ID, and practicing the Thai language were the main ways of avoiding the stigma reported by the stateless population. Obtaining a Thai ID was detected as the top goal in their aim to overcome the stigma problem. CONCLUSIONS: The stateless population in Thailand live as an invisible population and are negatively treated via various patterns from others.

However, the impact of PPM implantation on long-term mortality has not been fully established. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether PPM post-SAVR increases the risk of mortality. METHODS We searched Cochrane, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2020 for studies comparing mortality between patients who received PPM post-SAVR and those who did not. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to determine the effect of PPM on early and late mortality. The effect sizes were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Three studies met criteria, which yielded a total of 9,105 patients. The most common indication was post-operative complete atrioventricular block. While there was no difference in early mortality between the PPM and no PPM groups (RR 1.19; 95%CI 0.20-7.08; I2=23%), PPM implantation was shown to significantly increase late mortality (RR 1.49; 95%CI 1.25-1.77; I2=0%).

The underlying mechanism of these life-threatening disorders is impaired granule-mediated cytotoxicity exerted by natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes. This function is meant for elimination of virus-infected cells, malignant cells and to prevent exaggerated immune responses. The normal outcome after an attack by NK or cytotoxic T cells is apoptosis of the target cell. This prevents cytotoxic inflammatory responses in adjacent tissues which occur after lytic cell death. Extensive cell lysis can even produce a cytokine storm, as evidenced in MAS. Programmed proinflammatory lytic cell death, pyroptosis, caused by activated inflammasomes is central in the pathogenesis of MAS. Pyroptosis mediates IL-18 cytokine release, which robustly stimulates NK and T cells to produce IFN-, the key macrophage-activating signal which initiates a burst of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lytic cell death also mediates a discharge of the prototype alarmin high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a proinflammatory molecule present in all cells and that mediates the pathogenesis of MAS as outlined here.

Is cerebrovascular reactivity affected by isocapnic changes in breathing pattern? What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding is that cerebrovascular reactivity does not change with isocapnic variations in tidal volume and frequency. ABSTRACT Deviations of arterial carbon dioxide tension from resting values affect cerebral blood vessel tone and thereby cerebral blood flow. Arterial carbon dioxide tension also affects central respiratory chemoreceptors, adjusting respiratory drive. This coincidence raises the question whether respiratory drive also affects the cerebral blood flow response to carbon dioxide. A change in cerebral blood flow for a given change in the arterial carbon dioxide tension is defined as cerebrovascular reactivity. Two studies have reached conflicting conclusions on this question, using voluntary control of breathing as a disturbing factor during measurements of cerebrovascular reactivity. Here we address some of the methodological limitations of both studies by using sequential gas delivery and targeted control of carbon dioxide and oxygen to enable a separation of the effects of carbon dioxide on cerebrovascular reactivity from breathing vigor.

This study was conducted in 2020 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of external nasal dilator strips (ENDS) coupled with N95 respirators in a sample of community hospital emergency department personnel. METHODS After obtaining written consent, the authors tested participants response to exercise (i.e., walking up 10 flights of stairs) while wearing an N95 respirator, both with and without an ENDS. The authors measured participants heart rate and respiratory effort responses over four minutes following their exercise trial. A convenience sample of these personnel also repeated their respirator fit testing while wearing an ENDS with the N95 style they had previously been fitted for. RESULTS A total of N = 50 participants were enrolled. Peak heart rate while wearing an ENDS was 125 beats per minute (BPM) with the ENDS versus 130 BPM without (p = 0.21). The Borg Exertion Score while wearing an ENDS peaked at 13 with the ENDS versus 14 without (p = 0.08). However, when subjects were surveyed before and after the trial upon whether they would consider using an ENDS beneath their N95 using a scale of 1-5, their interest in this significantly increased (p = 0.004). Four of the 13 (31%) participants who completed repeated fit testing while wearing the ENDS beneath their N95 respirator failed the repeat testing. CONCLUSIONS These results first suggest that a sizable proportion of ED personnel may fail N95 fit testing while wearing an ENDS beneath the N95 mask for which they had been previously fitted. Although providers subjective interest in use of ENDS increased, these results also demonstrate that use of an ENDS beneath an N95 respirator may not significantly increase exercise tolerance.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of External Nasal Dilator Strips with N95 Respirator Masks by Emergency Department Personnel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past years, brain development has been investigated in rodent models, which were particularly relevant to establish the role of specific genes in this process.

Advancement in the study of the human brain surged with cultures of human brain tissue in the lab, generated from induced pluripotent cells reprogrammed from human somatic tissue. These cultures, termed brain organoids, offer an invaluable model for the study of the human brain.

The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today.

CONCLUSION: While evidence-based strategies to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborns are evolving, healthcare providers showed excellent knowledge of the infection and were vigilant regarding its complications for mothers and newborns. To ensure safe pregnancy, physicians must keep informed of developing guidance on best and safest prenatal and perinatal health services. Implementing local hospital policies and adequate training in infection control measures is strongly encouraged.","output":"Perceptions of obstetricians and pediatricians about the risk of COVID-19 for pregnant women and newborns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A global aerosolCclimate model, including a two-moment cloud microphysical scheme and a parametrization for aerosol-induced ice formation in cirrus clouds, is applied in order to quantify the impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds. Several sensitivity experiments are performed to assess the uncertainties in this effect related to (i) the assumptions on the ice nucleation abilities of aviation soot, (ii) the representation of vertical updrafts in the model, and (iii) the use of reanalysis data to relax the model dynamics (the so-called nudging technique). Based on the results of the model simulations, a radiative forcing from the aviation sootCcirrus effect in the range of -35 to 13 mW m-2 is quantified, depending on the assumed critical saturation ratio for ice nucleation and active fraction of aviation soot but with a confidence level below 95 % in several cases. Simple idealized experiments with prescribed vertical velocities further show that the uncertainties on this aspect of the model dynamics are critical for the investigated effect and could potentially add a factor of about 2 of further uncertainty to the model estimates of the resulting radiative forcing. The use of the nudging technique to relax model dynamics is proved essential in order to identify a statistically significant signal from the model internal variability, while simulations performed in free-running mode and with prescribed sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations are shown to be unable to provide robust estimates of the investigated effect. A comparison with analogous model studies on the aviation sootCcirrus effect show a very large model diversity, with a conspicuous lack of consensus across the various estimates, which points to the need for more in-depth analyses on the roots of such discrepancies.","output":"Exploring the uncertainties in the aviation sootCcirrus effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The clinical teaching of psychiatry to medical students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has presented opportunities for support, engagement and learning above and beyond usual practice.

One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7, O26:H11, O91:H21, O111:H2, O8, O127: H6, O86 and O128:H2.

The authors discussed in-depth and determined whether or not an ED visit was unnecessary, and further classified the causes of unnecessary visits into three categories. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.9 years (range, 15C99 years), and among the 1,343 patients discharged from the unit, 720 (53.6%) were men. Overall, 215 patients (16.0%) visited the ED within 30 days after discharge; among them, 16.3% were readmitted. Of the 215 cases of ED visits within 30 days after discharge, 57 (26.5%) were considered unnecessary. Of these, 30 (52.6%) were categorized as having failed care transition, 15 (26.3%) had unestablished care plans for predictable issues, and 12 (21.1%) had insufficient patient education.

Frailty and malnutrition are key geriatric syndromes that impact postoperative outcomes, including morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospital length of stay. Enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs), such as prehabilitation, have been associated with a reduction in complications after CS in vulnerable patients. The use of nutritional ERPs may enhance short-term and long-term recovery and mitigate frailty progression while improving patient-reported outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This trial is a two-centre, double-blinded, placebo, randomised controlled trial with blinded endpoint assessment and intention-to-treat analysis. One-hundred and fifty CS patients will be randomised to receive either a leucine-rich protein supplement or a placebo with no supplemented protein. Patients will consume their assigned supplement two times per day for approximately 2 weeks pre-procedure, during in-hospital postoperative recovery and for 8 weeks following discharge. The primary outcome will be the Short Physical Performance Battery score. Data collection will occur at four time points including baseline, in-hospital (pre-discharge), 2-month and 6-month time points post-surgery.

In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by more than three times (risk ratio (RR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0 to 5.1, P < 0.001, I(2) statistic 44%) and at 48 hours by 1.7 times. Fewer than four people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 14 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present. At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scores) was reduced by an additional 14% by corticosteroids. No difference in rates of recurrence, relapse or adverse events were reported for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo, although reporting of adverse events was poor. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, increase the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Further trials assessing corticosteroids in the absence of antibiotics and in children are warranted.","output":"Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients infected with COVID-19 are at risk of serious complications such as hospitalization and death. The prognosis and lethality of COVID-19 infection in patients with established kidney disease has not been widely studied. METHODS: Data included patients who underwent kidney biopsy at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital between January 2013 and February 2020 with COVID-19 diagnosis during the period from March 1 to May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (7%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Mean age was 63  15 years and 48.7% were male. Hypertension was present in 79.5%, CKD without renal replacement therapy in 76.9%, and cardiovascular disease in 64.1%. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 26 patients; older (p = 0.01), hypertensive (p = 0.005), and immunosuppressed (p = 0.01) patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs (p = 0.04), and those with gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.02) were more likely to be tested for CO-VID-19. Twenty-two patients required hospitalization and 15.4% died. In bivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (p = 0.03), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.05), and low hemoglobin levels (p = 0.006). Adjusted Cox regression showed that low hemoglobin levels at admission had 1.81 greater risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CO-VID-19 infection and kidney disease confirmed by kidney biopsy presented a mortality of 15.4%. Swab test for COVID-19 was more likely to be performed in older, hypertensive, and immunosuppressed patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms. Low hemoglobin is a risk factor for mortality.","output":"COVID-19 in CKD Patients: Lessons from 553 CKD Patients with Biopsy-Proven Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1) Many wild bee species interact with soil either as a nesting substrate or material. These soil interactions create a risk of exposure to agrochemicals such as imidacloprid or other neonicotinoid pesticides that can persist in soil for months after application. At the landscape level, concentrations of imidacloprid residue in soil are limited to the immediate treatment area, and thus risks to soil-interacting bees could be low if they avoid contaminated soils. 2) We utilized Osmia lignaria (Say), a solitary cavity nesting bee which collects mud to partition and seal nests, and conducted two laboratory experiments to test whether nesting females select or avoid soils containing various levels of imidacloprid residue. For the first experiment, we assessed behavioral responses of females to treated soil utilizing a choice arena and pairing various choices of soil with imidacloprid residues ranging between 0 and 780 ppb. For the second experiment, we developed a laboratory assay to assess soil selection of actively nesting O. lignaria, by providing choices of contaminated soil between 0 and 100 ppb and 0 and 1,000 ppb to nesting females. 3) We found no evidence that O. lignaria females avoided any level of imidacloprid contamination, even at the highest residue level (1,000 ppb) in both the experiments, which may have implications for risk. The in situ nesting methodology developed in this study has future applications for research on soil or pollen preferences of cavity nesting Osmia species, and potential for breeding of O. lignaria in laboratory.","output":"Mason Bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) Exhibit No Avoidance of Imidacloprid-Treated Soils."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns restricted human and traffic mobility impacting the patterns and severity of road traffic collisions (RTCs) . We aimed to study the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on incidence, patterns, severity of the injury, and outcomes of hospitalized RTCs trauma patients in Al-Ain City, United Arab Emirates. Methods: : We compared the data of two cohorts of patients which were collected over two periods;the pandemic period (28 March 2020 to 27 March 202) and the pre-pandemic period (28 March 2019 to 27 March 2020). All RTCs trauma patients who were hospitalized in the two major trauma centers (Al-Ain and Tawam Hospitals) of Al-Ain City were studied. Results: : Overall, the incidence of hospitalized RTC trauma patients significantly reduced by 33.5% during the Pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period. The mechanism of injury was significantly different between the two periods (p< 0.0001, Fishers Exact test). MVCs were less during the Pandemic (60.5% compared with 72%), while motorcycle injuries were more (23.3 % compared with 11.2 %). The mortality of hospitalized RTC patients was significantly higher during the Pandemic (4.4 % compared with 2.3 %, p=0.045, Fishers Exact test). Conclusions: : Our study has shown that the numbers of hospitalized RTC trauma patients reduced by 33.5% during the COVID-19 Pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period in our setting. This was attributed to the reduced motor vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle injuries while motorcycle injuries increased.

We performed CPT for these patients and the patient's condition was improved and able to be discharged. DISCUSSION: Severe COVID-19 with or without comorbid was the indication of CPT which had been approved by the U.S. FDA and Indonesian Pediatrics Society. The key factors associated with CPT efficacy were the donor's titer antibody, the treatment time point, and the patient's comorbidities. The clinical impact showed an improvement by the combination therapy of CPT and remdesivir.

One year ago, the first nationwide survey on this topic showed a dramatic impact of the acute phase of the pandemic on residents training activities. Aiming to assess for the first time how the COVID-19 scenario reshaped the pattern of urology training over a whole pandemic year, a cross-sectional, 38-item, web-based survey was developed. Residents scored the percentage decrease of their involvement in various clinical and surgical activities during the period of March 2020CMarch 2021 (as compared with the pre-COVID period). Overall, 312/585 (53.3%) residents from 27 schools of urology were included. The proportions of those experiencing a significant decrease of training exposure were 13.6%, 28.8%, 26.7%, 46.9%, 37.6%, and 33.3% (as compared with 40.2%, 85.8%. 82.3%, 69.7%, 59.7%, and 50.2% in the previous survey) for on-call activities, outpatient visits, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic surgery, open surgery, and minimally invasive surgery, respectively. The most impactful reductions in training activities were reached by final-year residents. Our findings highlight that, even if less burdensome than expected, urology residency training (especially in endoscopic surgery) was highly affected throughout the whole past year. This critical gap of skills may jeopardize residents training even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we assessed whether the training activities of Italian urology residents were impacted negatively by a whole year of COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020CMarch 2021). We also compared our results with those reported in a previous survey evaluating how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed the training pattern of urology residents during the peak of the outbreak in March 2020. We found a critical decrease in residents activities (especially for those in their final years of residency and for surgical procedures) that, even if lower than expected, might negatively impact their education and training in the future.","output":"Urology Residency Training at the Time of COVID-19 in Italy: 1 Year After the Beginning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) represent a promising class of nanomaterials for lasing applications. Currently, one of the key challenges facing the development of high-performance NC optical gain media lies in enhancing the lifetime of biexciton populations. This usually requires the employment of charge-delocalizing particle architectures, such as core/shell NCs, nanorods, and nanoplatelets. Here, we report on a two-dimensional nanoshell quantum dot (QD) morphology that enables a strong delocalization of photoinduced charges, leading to enhanced biexciton lifetimes and low lasing thresholds. A unique combination of a large exciton volume and a smoothed potential gradient across interfaces of the reported CdSbulk/CdSe/CdSshell (core/shell/shell) nanoshell QDs results in strong suppression of Auger processes, which was manifested in this work though the observation of stable amplified stimulated emission (ASE) at low pump fluences. An extensive charge delocalization in nanoshell QDs was confirmed by transient absorption measurements, showing that the presence of a bulk-size core in CdSbulk/CdSe/CdSshell QDs reduces exciton-exciton interactions.

The long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes of these treatments in a tertiary referral center for proctology were evaluated. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed in all patients with grade III hemorrhoids who were treated between January 2013 and August 2018. Medical history, symptoms, reinterventions, complications, and patient-reported outcome measurements (PROM) were retrieved from individual electronic patient files, which were prospectively entered as standard questionnaires in our clinic. Results Overall, 327 patients (163 males) were treated by either RBL (n=182) or hemorrhoidectomy (n=145). The median follow-up was 44 months. The severity of symptoms and patient preference led to the treatment of choice. The most commonly experienced symptoms were prolapse (83.2%) and blood loss (69.7%). Hemorrhoidectomy was effective in 95.9% of the cases as a single procedure, while a single RBL procedure was only effective in 51.6%. In the RBL group, 34.6% received a second RBL session. Complications were not significantly different, 11 (7.6%) after hemorrhoidectomy versus 6 (3.3%) after RBL. However, 4 fistulas developed after hemorrhoidectomy and none after RBL (P<0.05). The pre-procedure PROM score was higher in the hemorrhoidectomy group whereas the post-procedure PROM score did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion Treatment of grade III hemorrhoids usually requires more than one session RBL whereas 1-time hemorrhoidectomy suffices. Complications were more common after hemorrhoidectomy.

The pathogenesis of AA may be affected by the diet. However, the dietary habits of patients with AA have not been precisely examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the dietary habits of patients with AA in comparison to those of healthy controls. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the dietary habits of 70 adult Japanese patients with AA using a brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire and compared them to the habits of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: Japanese patients with AA had a higher body mass index (BMI) and higher intakes of vitamin C and fruit than the controls. Logistic regression analysis showed that AA was associated with BMI. Retinol intake was positively correlated with severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score, and linear regression analysis revealed that retinol intake was a predictor of SALT score. Retinol intake among patients with moderate to severe AA (ie, a SALT score >25) was higher than that in patients with mild AA (a SALT score 25). The mean age of AA patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) was lower than that of AA patients without AD; however, there were no differences in nutrient or food intake between these two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the comorbidity AD was negatively associated with age. Conclusion: AA was associated with a high BMI, and high retinol intake was a predictor of SALT score.

Methods: In April 2020, a total of 60 patients and 59 caregivers were administered by phone scales assessing patients' QoL (McGill QoL Questionnaire), general health status (EQ-5D-5L), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient's QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265).

In such a context, further concerns have been raised about the relationship between wealth accumulation and improvement of economic well-being, mainly through consumption. The issue becomes even more important when considering the challenges facing China in recent years, which can be characterized by a mix of increasingly leveraged households, escalating housing price, sluggish consumption, slowing economic expansion, trade frictions with the United States, and the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic difficulties. With that background in mind, this paper first provides international evidence on the relationship between household consumption and wealth, especially in the form of houses. Drawing on a panel of aggregate data for fourteen countries including China, we find that household consumption positively responds to changes in housing wealth, and this link is further affected by different levels of government spending and financial development. We next relate the international evidence to the case of China, with the focus on some recent policy issues over housing regulations and consumption promotion. Importantly, as the evidence and underlying theories suggest, housing wealth-consumption association does not follow a simplistic pattern, and thus, multiple policy measures could and should be undertaken rather than merely curbing speculative activities in real estate exchanges and associated financial business.","output":"How does housing wealth affect household consumption?

After OHT, patients are increased risk of COVID infection and hospitalization. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 119 patients who underwent OHT between 2017 and 2021. Eleven patients were excluded who died prior to the COVID outbreak in the United States. Results The mean age was 51 years (IQR 26). The known vaccination rate (partial or complete) was 83%. The overall infection rate was 14% (17 COVID cases were identified.) Five patients were infected prior to the availability of the COVID vaccine. Of the remaining 2 (16%) and 5 (42%) were in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients respectively. The hospitalization rate due to COVID infection or COVID-related complications such as supplemental oxygen use was 29%. All hospitalized subjects underwent changes in their antirejection therapies, and half required oxygen supplementation therapy at discharge. No COVID-related deaths were identified. There were 2 partially/fully vaccinated patients at the time of COVID infection. One patient had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization while the other patient was asymptomatic. Conclusion Hospitalization rates were markedly higher in the OHT cohort compared to Kentucky state data (29% vs 4%.) Multiple factors contribute to this finding. Patients with OHT have more co-morbidities and after OHT and immunosuppressant therapy blunts host response to infection placing these patients at higher risk of complications. There was a higher vaccination rate in our OHT cohort compared to Kentucky state data (83% vs 61%). Breakthrough COVID infection was found in only 4% of OHT patients strongly supporting the efficacy of the vaccination in this immunosuppressant subgroup. While there were no COVID related deaths in our cohort, downstream complications related to immunosuppression changes and organ rejection detection require long term follow up. The vaccine has proved highly efficacious in this group and should be implemented up front, prior to transplantation.

The PED in the trust receives 3300 attendances of paediatric asthma and VIW annually with 780 hospitalisations.. There is a cohort of 120 children attending 3 or more times in a year. The common issues noted in this cohort were lack of compliance, varying levels of engagement and missed clinic appointments. When the pandemic was declared, there were concerns of delayed presentations due to fears of contacting Covid-19. Towards addressing this, virtual asthma clinics were started, running seven days a week to support children with asthma and their families.ObjectivesThe objective was to learn from the pandemic dataset and take the lessons moving forward.MethodsWe analysed the data of PED attendances and admissions with asthma/VIW in 2020, extracted from the electronic database and compared it with similar data from 2019.ResultsThere was an unprecedented reduction in PED attendances for children with asthma and VIW from the time of the first lockdown in March 2020 to August 2020(45% reduction in March 2020 compared to the previous year, 91% reduction from April to July 2020 compared to the previous year). There was a 80 -90% reduction in admissions for asthma/VIW during this time period and fewer severe asthma presentations. Factors like lockdown, closure of schools and hand washing were probably the main contributors in interrupting the chain of transmission of not only COVID-19 but other viruses too. Anecdotal evidence from clinicians who led the virtual asthma clinics reported improved engagement and compliance with preventers especially from repeat attenders and teenagers who previously had shown poor compliance. Change in patient and parent specific behaviour due to fears of contracting COVID-19 contributed to better self-management of paediatric asthma.However a seasonal spike in asthma attacks which is common in September (the September epidemic) did happen in 2020 as children returned to school. There was a 45 - 55% reduction in attendances in October and November 2020. With the announcement of the second lockdown in December asthma/VIW attendances dropped by 84C91% from December to February 2020, a dramatic decline. Prevalence of COVID -19 or endemic winter viruses did not seem to contribute to attendances or admissions for children with asthma and VIW.ConclusionsThis COVID-19 pandemic has shown us a snapshot of how childhood asthma can be managed in a different way. Identifying the patterns of change is important for the future as this experience can be used to promote integrated care for children with asthma and VIW.

In contrast to previous studies that attempt to predict the success of crowdfunded projects based on specific characteristics of the projects and their creators, we present a more general approach that focuses on crowd dynamics and is robust to the particularities of different crowdfunding platforms. We rely on a multi-method analysis to investigate the correlates, predictive importance, and quasi-causal effects of features that describe crowd dynamics in determining the success of crowdfunded projects. By applying a multi-method analysis to a study of fundraising in three different online markets, we uncover general crowd dynamics that ultimately decide which projects will succeed. In all analyses and across the three different platforms, we consistently find that funders' behavioural signals (1) are significantly correlated with fundraising success; (2) approximate fundraising outcomes better than the characteristics of projects and their creators such as credit grade, company valuation, and subject domain; and (3) have significant quasi-causal effects on fundraising outcomes while controlling for potentially confounding project variables. By showing that universal features deduced from crowd behaviour are predictive of fundraising success on different crowdfunding platforms, our work provides design-relevant insights about novel types of collective decision-making online.

Despite a rising population share with clean cooking access, the number of cooking poor remains stagnant. In this study we explored clean cooking access until 2050 under three reference scenarios, a COVID-19 recovery scenario and ambitious climate mitigation policy scenarios. Our analysis shows that universal access may not be achieved even in 2050. A protracted recession after the pandemic could leave an additional 470 million people unable to afford clean cooking services in 2030 relative to a reference scenario, with populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia the worst affected.

In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of financialisation to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive business models, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations.

We sought to investigate whether biomarkers of gut dysfunction would be useful in assessment of HF (e.g., severity, adverse outcomes) and risk stratification. METHODS A panel of gut-related biomarkers including metabolites of the choline/carnitine- pathway [acetyl-L-carnitine, betaine, choline, -butyrobetaine, L-carnitine and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)] and the gut peptide, Trefoil Factor-3 (TFF-3), were investigated in 1,783 patients with worsening HF enrolled in the systems BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure (BIOSTAT-CHF) cohort and associations with HF severity and outcomes, and use in risk stratification were assessed. RESULTS Metabolites of the carnitine-TMAO pathway (acetyl-L-carnitine, -butyrobetaine, L-carnitine and TMAO) and TFF-3 were associated with the composite outcome of HF hospitalisation or all-cause mortality at 3 years [HR 2.04-2.93 (95% CI 1.30-4.71) p0.002]. Combining the carnitine-TMAO metabolites with TFF-3, as a gut dysfunction panel, showed a graded association; a greater number of elevated markers was associated with higher New York Heart Association class (p<0.001), higher plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (p<0.001), and worse outcome [HR 1.90-4.58 (95% CI 1.19-6.74) p0.008].

For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. RESULTS: A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20-85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression.

The long-term implications on survival of these slowdowns for patients with cancer in Canada is unknown. METHODS: We constructed a microsimulation model based on real-world population data on cancer care from Ontario, Canada, from 2019 and 2020. Our model estimated wait times for cancer surgery over a 6-month period during the pandemic by simulating a slowdown in operating room capacity (60% operating room resources in month 1, 70% in month 2, 85% in months 3C6), as compared with simulated prepandemic conditions with 100% resources. We used incremental differences in simulated wait times to model survival using per-day hazard ratios for risk of death. Primary outcomes included life-years lost per patient and per cancer population. We conducted scenario analyses to evaluate alternative, hypothetical scenarios of different levels of surgical slowdowns on risk of death. RESULTS: The simulated model population comprised 22 799 patients waiting for cancer surgery before the pandemic and 20 177 patients during the pandemic. Mean wait time to surgery prepandemic was 25 days and during the pandemic was 32 days. Excess wait time led to 0.01C0.07 life-years lost per patient across cancer sites, translating to 843 (95% credible interval 646C950) life-years lost among patients with cancer in Ontario.

The frequency of acute cardiac injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is unknown. The objective was to compare the rates of cardiac injury by angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-binding viruses from viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of coronavirus disease 2019 literature on PubMed and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 57 studies including 34,072 patients, acute cardiac injury occurred in 50% (95% CI, 44-57%) of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The overall risk of acute cardiac injury was 21% (95% CI, 18-26%) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Using sample price data from bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, EOS, litecoin, stellar, cardano and IOTA, respectively, we document heterogeneity in the types of feedback trading strategies investors utilize across markets. Whereas some cryptocurrency markets show evidence of herding, or, trend chasing, behaviors, in other markets we show evidence of contrarian-type behaviors. These findings are important because they elucidate upon, firstly, what forces drive cryptocurrency markets and, secondly, how this type of trading behavior affects autocorrelation patters for cryptocurrencies.

CRF and Ucn1 activate both CRF1 and CRF2, while Ucn2 and Ucn3 activate selectively CRF2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CRF, Ucn1, Ucn2 and Ucn3 on the hippocampal acetylcholine release through which they may modulate cognitive functions, including attention, learning and memory. In this purpose male Wistar rats were used, their hippocampus was isolated, dissected, incubated, superfused and stimulated electrically. The hippocampal slices were first pretreated with selective CRF1 antagonist antalarmin or selective CRF2 antagonist astressin2B, and then treated with non-selective CRF1 agonists, CRF or Ucn1, and selective CRF2 agonists, Ucn2 or Ucn3. The hippocampal acetylcholine release was increased significantly by CRF and Ucn1 and decreased significantly by Ucn2 and Ucn3. The increasing effect of CRF and Ucn1 was reduced significantly by antalarmin, but not astressin2B. In contrast, the decreasing effect of Ucn2 and Ucn3 was reversed significantly by the selective CRF2, but not the selective CRF1 antagonist. Our results demonstrate that CRF and Ucn1 stimulate the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF1, whereas Ucn2 and Ucn3 inhibit the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF2. Therefore, the present study suggests the existence of two apparently opposing CRF systems in the hippocampus, through which CRF and the urocortins might modulate cholinergic activity and thereby cognitive functions.","output":"The effects of CRF and the urocortins on the hippocampal acetylcholine release in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The only definitive therapy for end\\\\stage liver disease is whole\\\\organ transplantation.

Re\\\\expression of HNF42, the predominant P1\\\\HNF4, reinstates the transcriptional network, normalizes the genes important for hepatocyte function, and reverses liver failure in rodents.

The paradigm shift of focus to COVID-related research and management has significantly affected various scientific domains, including biodiversity conservation. We assessed the perceptions of early-career researchers working for biodiversity conservation across India, to understand the impacts of the ongoing pandemic on their research. We administered an online questionnaire survey to 565 respondents, who identified four key areas that are affected by the pandemic: (1) research, (2) conservation (3) education, and (4) communication and networking. Respondents (89.2%) perceived that their fieldwork, followed by travel for meetings and funding were the most affected due to COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. Nonetheless, responses on the impact varied between different professional categories and were disproportionate. Our study highlights that majority of the respondents (80%) advocate for stakeholder-driven policies and management practices as the most effective strategy to promote biodiversity conservation, in the post-COVID-19 world. To this end, as a post-pandemic response, we propose holistic solutions such as optimising research funding and collaborations, and supporting and strengthening them by citizen science and big data analytics.

Due to the great demand for effective COVID-19 testing programmes to control the spread of the disease, we have suggested such a testing programme that includes a rapid RT-qPCR approach without RNA extraction. The Direct-One-Step-RT-qPCR (DIOS-RT-qPCR) assay detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one hour while maintaining the high sensitivity and specificity required of diagnostic tools. This optimised protocol allows for the direct use of swab transfer media (14 L) without the need for RNA extraction, achieving comparable sensitivity to the standard method that requires the time-consuming and costly step of RNA isolation. The limit of detection for DIOS-RT-qPCR was lower than seven copies/reaction, which translates to 550 virus copies/mL of swab. The speed, ease of use and low price of this assay make it suitable for high-throughput screening programmes. The use of fast enzymes allows RT-qPCR to be performed under standard laboratory conditions within one hour, making it a potential point-of-care solution on high-speed cycling instruments. This protocol also implements the heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (75 C for 10 min), which renders samples non-infectious, enabling testing in BSL-2 facilities. Moreover, we discuss the critical steps involved in developing tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19.

A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction between age and HWC. Results: Approximately 17% (n = 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17). For participants &#8805;65 years, only obesity class II (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10-1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight.

The city imposed different levels of social distancing including, the closure of sports venues and restrictions on eateries. This inevitably affects the eating behaviour and physical activities of the population. We examined the changes in eating behavior and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified sociodemographic factors associated with the behavioral changes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study via a random telephone survey of Chinese adults conducted in Hong Kong from May to June, 2020 - a period in which social distancing measures were being imposed. We measured the physical activity habits from four aspects and dietary consumption patterns from seven aspects before and during the pandemic based on the World Health Organization's guidelines and previous publications. RESULTS: In total, 724 participants were recruited. Individuals were found to cook more frequently at home (p < 0.001) and order take-out (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no significant change in the frequency of fast food consumption was observed, we found significant increases in the frequency of eating fruits (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.004). The frequencies of walking, moderate-intensive sports, and high-intensity sports were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). We found that healthy lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic were negatively associated with participants' economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measures likely provided an opportunity for individuals to stay home and thus eat healthier. However, in a prolonged period of social restrictions, a lower physical activity level poses a risk to public health. Public health officials are thus advised to monitor physical health on a population-wide basis. The findings highlighted the importance of interventions tailored to individuals who have prolonged home stays - particularly for individuals in the low economic group.","output":"Change in eating habits and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong: a cross-sectional study via random telephone survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored the associations among psychological well-being (PWB), self-compassion, psychological inflexibility (PI), and parenting stress (PS) in 242 urban Indian mothers of children 10 years old and younger in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theoretical development and empirical research on epistemic injustice are crucial for providing more nuanced understandings of the mechanisms and structures leading to the exclusion of local and marginalised groups in research and other knowledge practices. Explicit analysis of the potential role of epistemic injustice in policies and practices is currently limited with the absence of methodological starting points. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a guide for individuals involved in the design and review of funding schemes wishing to conduct epistemic injustice analysis of their processes using a decolonial lens. Placing contemporary concerns in a wider historical, political and social context and building from the intertwined issues of coloniality of power, coloniality of knowledge and coloniality of being that systematically exclude non-Western epistemic groups, this practice paper presents a three-step decolonial approach for understanding the role and impact of epistemic injustices in global health research funding. It starts with an understanding of how power operates in setting the aim of a call for research proposals. Then, the influence of pose and gaze in the review process is analysed to highlight the presence of epistemological colonisation before discussing methods to address the current funding asymmetries by supporting new ways of being and doing focused on knowledge plurality. Expanding research on how epistemic wrongs manifest in global health funding practices will generate key insights needed to address underlying drivers of inequities within global health project conception and delivery.","output":"How to identify epistemic injustice in global health research funding practices: a decolonial guide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research article is devoted to establish some general aggregation operators, based on Yager's t-norm and t-conorm, to cumulate the Fermatean fuzzy data in decision-making environments The Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs), an extension of the orthopair fuzzy sets, are characterized by both membership degree (MD) and nonmembership degree (NMD) that enable them to serve as an excellent tool to represent inexact human opinions in the decision-making process In this article, the valuable properties of the FFS are merged with the Yager operator to propose six new operators, namely, Fermatean fuzzy Yager weighted average (FFYWA), Fermatean fuzzy Yager ordered weighted average (FFYOWA), Fermatean fuzzy Yager hybrid weighted average (FFYHWA), Fermatean fuzzy Yager weighted geometric (FFYWG), Fermatean fuzzy Yager ordered weighted geometric (FFYOWG), and Fermatean fuzzy Yager hybrid weighted geometric (FFYHWG) operators A comprehensive discussion is made to elaborate the dominant properties of the proposed operators To verify the importance of the proposed operators, an MADM strategy is presented along with an application for selecting an authentic lab for the COVID-19 test The superiorities of the proposed operators and limitations of the existing operators are discussed with the help of a comparative study Moreover, we have explained comparison between the proposed theory and the Fermatean fuzzy TOPSIS method to check the accuracy and validity of the proposed operators The influence of various values of the parameter in the Yager operator on decision-making results is also examined","output":"Decision-Making Analysis Based on Fermatean Fuzzy Yager Aggregation Operators with Application in COVID-19 Testing Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men in the United States.

A total of 56 adult patients and 22 pediatric patients were seen for chemotherapy during the period of April 28 to July 15, 2020. A total of 144 chemotherapy sessions for adults and 190 sessions for pediatric patients were done. Fifty nine patients (43 adults and 16 pediatric) were tested for COVID-19 RT PCR (GeneXpert?), as baseline prior to chemotherapy, and all were negative. During the course of treatment, adverse events were noted including infusion reactions, hematologic complications which resolved without any complications.

Materials and Methods: Internet survey with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and questions regarding mobility patterns, attitude, and propensity to adjust toward the implemented measures and current health condition was made among Polish and Italian residents (Cronbach's alpha 0.86 and 0.79, respectively). The sample size was 7,108 (6,169 completed questionnaires in Poland and 939 in Italy). Results: The Polish group had a higher stress level than the Italian group (mean PSS-10 total score 22,14 vs 17,01, respectively;p &lt; 0.01). There was a greater prevalence of chronic diseases among Polish respondents. Italian subjects expressed more concern about their health, as well as about their future employment. Italian subjects did not comply with suggested restrictions as much as Polish subjects and were less eager to restrain from their usual activities (social, physical, and religious), which were more often perceived as \\"most needed matters\\" in Italian than in Polish residents. Conclusion: Higher activity level was found to be correlated with lower perceived stress, but the causality is unclear. Difference in adherence to restrictions between Polish and Italian residents suggests that introducing similar lockdown policies worldwide may not be as beneficial as expected. However, due to the applied method of convenience sampling and uneven study groups, one should be careful with generalizing these results.","output":"Social Isolation During COVID-19 Pandemic.

We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting ? agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA-LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting ? agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA-LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. FINDINGS: We identified 148a557 people with COPD and 818a490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA-LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 139 [95% CI 110-176]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (155 [110-218]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (114 [085-154]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 143). INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

We investigated immunogenicity after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in kidney transplant recipients who are and are not taking belatacept. METHODS: Participants were recruited between 12/9/2020 - 4/1/2021. Blood samples were collected after dose 1 and dose 2 (D1, D2), and analyzed using either an anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme immunoassay against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) was used to compare immunogenicity and a weighted logistics regression was used to calculate fold change of positive response. RESULTS: Among the 609 participants studied, 24 (4%) were taking belatacept. After dose 1, 0/24 (0%) belatacept patients had detectable antibodies, compared to 77/568 (14%) among the equivalent nonbelatacept population (p=0.06).

The knowledge questionnaire contained questions about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, prevention, and management. The evaluation of attitudes and practices included questions regarding actions and adjustments in COVID-19 response activities. Knowledge scores were measured and compared using demographic characteristics, as well as attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Using SPSS-IBM 25, bivariate statistics were done to analyze the data. Results: 146 healthcare professionals completed the survey. Physicians were the most prominent party in the survey, accounting for 74 (51 percent), followed by nurses 44 (30 percent) and pharmacists 28 (19 percent). The participants' average age was 39.69  8.48 years. The participant's mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 11.43  1.34, 3.89  0.93, and 3.85  0.81, respectively.

METHODS: Early in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, routine dental care was suspended in many countries, and only patients needing urgent or emergency care could be seen. During this period, orthodontists in Brazil were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Over 48 hours (May 1-3, 2020), 395 orthodontists (specialists, MScs, and PhDs) responded. They answered questions regarding dental office and appointments during the pandemic, the type of urgency or emergency care provided, the type of appliance and urgencies, etc. The level of concern about the impact of the pandemic on patients' orthodontic treatments and the financial impact on the dental office was also evaluated. Descriptive statistics were performed with percentages, and responses were compared between specialists, MScs, and PhDs, using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Specialists were the majority of respondents. Most orthodontists were handling only emergencies or urgencies. The most frequent urgencies were bracket breakage, archwire breakage, and breakage of molar tubes and/or bands. Stainless steel fixed appliances were the most common type of appliance related to unscheduled appointments. The majority of patients got in touch with the orthodontist using the professional WhatsApp messenger (WhatsApp Inc, Menlo Park, Calif). Orthodontists were more concerned with the financial impact of the pandemic than with the orthodontic treatment itself. CONCLUSIONS: Breakage of brackets, archwires, or tubes and/or bands were the most common causes of urgency and/or emergency appointments during the pandemic.

Few such studies exist for Poland, with analyses of within-the-country patterns being particularly scarce. The aim of this paper is to analyse differences in amenable mortality levels and trends across Polands regions using the most recent data and to gain a more nuanced understanding of these differences and possible reasons behind them. This can inform future health policy decisions, particularly when it comes to efforts to improve health system performance. We used national and regional mortality data to construct amenable mortality rates between 2002 and 2019. We found that the initially observed decline in amenable mortality stagnated between 2014 and 2019, something not seen elsewhere in Europe. The main driver behind this trend is the change in ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality. However, we also found that there is a systematic underreporting of IHD as a cause of death in Poland in favour of heart failure, which makes analysis of health system performance using amenable mortality as an indicator less reliable. We also found substantial geographical differences in amenable mortality levels and trends across Poland, which ranged from ?3.3% to +8.1% across the regions in 2014C2019. These are much bigger than variations in total mortality trends, ranging from ?1.5% to ?0.2% in the same period, which suggests that quality of care across regions varies substantially, although some of this effect is also a coding artefact.

During the pandemic, children and adolescents with a psychiatric disorder may experience exacerbation of their symptoms. However, little is known about this, since studies on this population during the pandemic are scarce. Objective To review the data available in the current literature on the effect of the pandemic on children and adolescents with a previous psychiatric disorder. Methods A literature search was carried out using PubMed, Scielo and, due to the exceptional conditions of the pandemic situation, directly using internet search engines.

By visualizing the entire supply chain with VSM, the waste that is produced during the delivery process from the retailer to the customer was identified. The five whys method was then applied to find the root cause of the waste. Furthermore, a scoring method was developed to evaluate and compare two different supply chain logistic models to identify a strategy for improvement. This study provides a systematic methodology to understand, evaluate, and improve the entire e-commerce supply chain process utilizing VSM. It was demonstrated that the methodology could improve supply chain management efficiency, customer satisfaction, and cost reduction.","output":"Application of Value Stream Mapping in E-Commerce: A Case Study on an Amazon Retailer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, at the time this article was written, there are over 127 million cases of patients with a confirmed link to COVID-19 and about 2 78 million deaths reported With limited access to vaccine or strong antiviral treatment for the novel coronavirus, actions in terms of prevention and containment of the virus transmission rely mostly on social distancing among susceptible and high-risk populations Aside from the direct challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, there are serious and growing secondary consequences caused by the physical distancing and isolation guidelines, among vulnerable populations Moreover, the healthcare system's resources and capacity have been focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, causing less urgent care, such as physical neurorehabilitation and assessment, to be paused, canceled, or delayed Overall, this has left elderly adults, in particular those with neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) conditions, without the required service support However, in many cases, such as stroke, the available time window of recovery through rehabilitation is limited since neural plasticity decays quickly with time Given that future waves of the outbreak are expected in the coming months worldwide, it is important to discuss the possibility of using available technologies to address this issue, as societies have a duty to protect the most vulnerable populations In this perspective review article, we argue that intelligent robotics and wearable technologies can help with remote delivery of assessment, assistance, and rehabilitation services while physical distancing and isolation measures are in place to curtail the spread of the virus By supporting patients and medical professionals during this pandemic, robots, and smart digital mechatronic systems can reduce the non-COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems Digital health and cloud telehealth solutions that can complement remote delivery of assessment and physical rehabilitation services will be the subject of discussion in this article due to their potential in enabling more effective and safer NMSDK rehabilitation, assistance, and assessment service delivery This article will hopefully lead to an interdisciplinary dialogue between the medical and engineering sectors, stake holders, and policy makers for a better delivery of care for those with NMSK conditions during a global health crisis including future pandemics","output":"Review: How Can Intelligent Robots and Smart Mechatronic Modules Facilitate Remote Assessment, Assistance, and Rehabilitation for Isolated Adults With Neuro-Musculoskeletal Conditions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a neoplasm characterized by BCR-ABL1, an oncoprotein with vital role in leukemogenesis.

In severe cases, the presence of kidney injury is associated with increased risk of death, highlighting the relevance of this organ as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake, but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation. The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation, and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death. In this review, we discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multiorgan damage.","output":"The case of complement activation in COVID-19 multiorgan impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can lead to a constellation of viral and immune symptoms called coronavirus disease 2019. Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5-7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications. We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute aortic occlusion: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is of interest to document the moelcular docking analysis of SARS-CoV-2 linked RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with compounds from Plectranthus amboinicus.

CT scans and X-rays play an important role in that direction. However, processing chest CT images and using them to accurately diagnose COVID-19 is a computationally expensive task. Machine Learning techniques have the potential to overcome this challenge. This article proposes two optimization algorithms for feature selection and classification of COVID-19. The proposed framework has three cascaded phases. Firstly, the features are extracted from the CT scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named AlexNet. Secondly, a proposed features selection algorithm, Guided Whale Optimization Algorithm (Guided WOA) based on Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS), is then applied followed by balancing the selected features. Finally, a proposed voting classifier, Guided WOA based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), aggregates different classifiers predictions to choose the most voted class. This increases the chance that individual classifiers, e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Trees (DT), to show significant discrepancies. Two datasets are used to test the proposed model: CT images containing clinical findings of positive COVID-19 and CT images negative COVID-19. The proposed feature selection algorithm (SFS-Guided WOA) is compared with other optimization algorithms widely used in recent literature to validate its efficiency. The proposed voting classifier (PSO-Guided-WOA) achieved AUC (area under the curve) of 0.995 that is superior to other voting classifiers in terms of performance metrics.

However, the benefits of continuing ABX in culture-negative (CxN) cases is unknown; this practice may increase the risks associated with ABX overuse. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes and antibiotic use (AU) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 based on culture results. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study evaluating adults in an ICU for the first episode of ABX initiated following a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between September to December 2020. Blood and/or respiratory cultures must have been obtained within 24 hours (h) of ABX initiation. Patients were categorized into three groups: 1) CxN, ABX discontinued  72 h, 2) CxN, ABX continued > 72 h, or 3) Culture-positive (CxP). Data on AU was obtained from electronic medication administration records. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as being discharged alive or > 2-point decrease in the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale score from day of ABX initiation to day 30. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included with 35.4% being CxP. ABX were discontinued  72 h in 23.8% of CxN patients. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism in 52.2% of CxP patients (66.7% respiratory; 16.7% blood; 16.7% both). Anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and anti-pseudomonal antibiotics were the most prescribed for the initial regimen (Table 1). ABX de-escalation occurred in 58.5% of patients. Initial ABX duration was significantly longer in the CxP group (P < 0.01). No significant difference in clinical success was observed (Table 2). Although not significantly different, the highest rate of adverse events occurred in the CxN and ABX continued > 72 h group (40.6%). Table 1.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 20 to April 30, 2020. The participants were students of medical and non-medical subjects from Libyan educational institutes. Data on participants' characteristics, knowledge, preventive behavior, and risk perception were collected. Results: Approximately 3669 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 2547 (69.4) were medical students and 1122 (30.6%) were non-medical students. The mean knowledge score on COVID-19 was 8.62 (SD: 1.26, range: 0-12), corresponding to 71.8% correct answers. A significant difference was observed between medical and non-medical students in terms of knowledge (p < 0.001).

The current choice of molecular methods for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes nucleic acid-based testing (NAT) for viral genetic material and antigen-based testing for viral protein identification. Host exposure is detected using antibody detection assays. While NATs require sophisticated instrument and trained manpower, antigen tests are plagued by their low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a test offering sensitive detection for presence of infection as a colorimetric readout holds promise to enable mass testing in resource constrained environments by minimally trained personnel. Here we present a novel HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) assay which combines specificity of NATs with sensitivity of enzymatic assays resulting in enhanced signal to noise ratios in an easily interpretable colorimetric readout. Using this assay, we could detect up to 102 copies of synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva as a detection matrix. Validating our assay on suspected human subjects, we found concordance with PCR based readouts with visible colorimetric distinction between positive and negative samples in less than an hour.

In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus.

Human to human transmission of the infection emphasizes the importance of adhering to public and social measure to halt its spread. However, the recent #ENDSARS protests led by angry youths in Nigeria resulted to complete flouting of all WHO guidelines meted to curb the spread of the virus. Given that the nation is the most populous African country with over 50 percent of her population been youths, this situation has huge implications for the country and Africa as a whole. The risk of community transmission occasioned by the protest, coupled with travels and active mobility across countries within the continent increases the risk of community transmission with possible increases in new cases over the next few weeks to months. From the foregoing, it is expedient to increase awareness and enforcement of the use of personal protective equipment especially use of nose masks, face shields and frequent hand washing or sanitizing in public places. These individual-targeted measures will go a long way to curtail the imminent community transmission of COVID-19 across Nigeria.

The aim of this study was to assess environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the expanded metropolitan area of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area. Moreover, Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis were performed to assess social indicators and environmental conditions which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19. Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city S?o Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of S?o Paulo. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density, and negatively correlated with social isolation rate, hence indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Finally, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be inversely correlated with both temperature and UV radiation.

We evaluated clinical outcome data of two hospitals that agreed on a predefined protocol for restrictive use of invasive ventilation where the decision to intubate was based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content rather than on the degree of hypoxemia. METHOD: Data analysis of patients with positive PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2, typical history, and symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates who exhibited oxygen saturation values of less than 93%. RESULTS: We identified 78 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The SaO2 nadir was 84.46.5% for the whole group. Fifty-three patients (68%) received nasal oxygen (group1), 17 patients (22%) were treated with nasal high-flow, CPAP, non-invasive ventilation, or a combination thereof (group 2) and 8 patients (10%) were intubated (group 3).

METHODS: The study adopts a qualitative methodology using desk review of regulatory and legislative information, literature review, and semi-structured interviews with key experts from the concerned governmental regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical industries, academic organizations, professional associations, civil society organizations, and clinicians who are working in researching treatments for hepatitis C. FINDINGS: The common DAAs available in the market are Daclatasvir, Sofosbuvir, and Sofosbuvir-based direct-acting antiviral combinations. Fast-track medicines registration pathway for marketing authorization of DAAs is used to reduce market access time frames. The pricing policies are supplemented using price negotiation to set up affordable prices that led to a reasonable price for DAAs. Using Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) flexibility and local production of quality generics DAAs at lower prices. In addition, political will and collaboration between the government, civil society, and pharmaceutical companies improved patients' access to affordable DAAs and succeeding hepatitis C treatment in Egypt. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicated that the implemented pharmaceutical policies and regulations have an immense role in enhancing access to medicines towards the elimination of hepatitis C in Egypt.

Currently, there are multiple NAAT platforms available, each offering certain performance and utility advantages and disadvantages as compared to each other. Next generation NAAT platforms aim to deliver increased target detection sensitivity and specificity, low limits of target detection, quantitative high multiplex target capacity, rapid time to results, and simple sample-to-answer workflow. Methods Here we describe the Torus Synestia System, a NAAT platform capable of rapid, highly multiplexed amplification and detection of both DNA and RNA targets. The platform comprises a small, portable (~ 2kg) amplification and detection device and a disposable single-use cartridge housing a PCR amplification chamber with an integrated label-free microarray for real-time data acquisition and interpretation. The platform offers a 30-min turnaround time with a detection limit of 10 DNA/RNA molecules per assay and single nucleotide discrimination. Results We demonstrate the Synestia System performance and utility with three distinct molecular applications: 1) detection of 20 genetic loci and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms in human genomic DNA;2) detection and genotyping of 43 unique bacterial species associated with human urinary tract infections;and 3) detection and profiling human respiratory viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-1/2, seasonal coronaviruses, Influenza A/B, and human respiratory syncytial viruses. In addition, the single-nucleotide specificity of our label-free microarray probes allowed for robust identification and discrimination of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages, such as B.1.1.7 (a.k.a. UK), B.1.351 (a.k.a. South African), P.1 (a.k.a. Brazilian), and B.1.617 (a.k.a. Indian). Conclusion The Torus Synestia System has broad applicability in both clinical and research environments. We are confident that the Torus Synestia System will revolutionize syndromic diagnostics at the point of care (PoC) and lead to improved response times during future epidemic and pandemic pathogen outbreaks.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of national datasets with application of standard UK costings. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All people who died in Scotland in 2016 aged 18 or older (N=56 407). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of use of the five unscheduled NHS services in the last 12 months of life by underlying cause of death, patient demographics, Continuous Unscheduled Pathways (CUPs) followed by patients during each care episode, total NHS and per-patient costs. RESULTS: 53 509 patients (94.9%) had at least one contact with an unscheduled care service during their last year of life (472 360 contacts), with 34.2% in the last month of life. By linking patient contacts during each episode of care, we identified 206 841 CUPs, with 133 980 (64.8%) starting out-of-hours. People with cancer were more likely to contact the NHS telephone advice line (63%) ((2) (4)=1004, p<0.001) or primary care out-of-hours (62%) ((2) (4)=1924, p<0.001) and have hospital admissions (88%) ((2) (4)=2644, p<0.001). People with organ failure (79%) contacted the ambulance service most frequently ((2) (4)=584, p<0.001). Demographic factors associated with more unscheduled care were older age, social deprivation, living in own home and dying of cancer. People dying with organ failure formed the largest group in the cohort and had the highest NHS costs as a group. The cost of providing services in the community was estimated at 3.9% of total unscheduled care costs despite handling most out-of-hours calls. CONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of people used NHS unscheduled care in their last year of life. Different underlying causes of death and demographic factors impacted on initial access and subsequent pathways of care. Managing more unscheduled care episodes in the community has the potential to reduce hospital admissions and overall costs.","output":"Unscheduled and out-of-hours care for people in their last year of life: a retrospective cohort analysis of national datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Specific tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations.

The data on maternal pregnancy outcomes were retrieved from a regional birth register and socio-economic variables from Statistics Sweden. The risk ratios for preeclampsia were calculated for educational level and household disposable income, adjusting for maternal region of birth, maternal age, body mass index, parity, and smoking. RESULTS: Low income levels were associated with a higher risk for preeclampsia, adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99, 1.59) and aRR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.68) for the two lowest quintiles, respectively, compared to the highest. There was an educational gradient in preeclampsia risk, although not all categories reached statistical significance: aRR = 1.16, (95% CI: 0.89-1.50) for low educational attainment and aRR = 1.23 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.41) for intermediate educational attainment compared to women with highest education.

A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total.

This study was designed to investigate if administration of sildenafil will attenuate post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by regulating miRNA-155 and miR-145 expressions. METHODS: Thirty-two male pigs (weighing 30  2 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups, sildenafil group (n = 8), sildenafil +NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg L) group (n = 8), saline (SA group, n = 8); and sham operation group (sham group, n = 8). Eight minutes of untreated VF was followed by defibrillation in anesthetized, closed-chest pigs. Hemodynamic status and blood samples were obtained at 0 min, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the hearts were removed and analyzed under electron microscopy, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and ultra structural analysis were performed to evaluate myocardial injury. RESULTS: Compared with the sildenafil + L-NAME and saline groups, the sildenafil group had better outcomes in terms of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism parameters as well as 24-h survival rate, and attenuated myocardial injury; In this study, CA pigs showed evidently increased levels of miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p, while the sildenafil treatment decreased the levels of miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p in CA pigs. In addition, the levels of eNOS was decreased in CA pigs, validating sildenafil attenuating post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by regulating miRNA-155 and miR-145 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil group had better outcomes in terms of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism parameters as well as 24-h survival rate, inhibited the increases in the miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p levels and attenuated myocardial injury in a porcine model of CA and resuscitation.

Although the SARS epidemic has subsided, many authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have warned of the possible re-emergence of this highly infectious disease. Although antibody-based diagnosis of SARS has been demonstrated to be a reliable proof of SARS infection, it is not sensitive enough for detection during the early phase of the disease. To date, based on the publicly released full genomic sequences of SARS-CoV, various molecular detection methods based on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been developed. Although most of the assays have initially been focused on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools, several of the more recently developed assays have been based on the analysis of RNA extracted from plasma and serum. Such assays allow the more standardized quantitative expression of viral loads and are potentially useful for early SARS diagnosis. In this chapter, two real-time quantitative RT-PCR systems for the quantification of SARS-CoV RNA in serum are discussed. The two RT-PCR systems, one aimed toward the nucleocapsid region and the other toward the polymerase region of the virus genome, have a detection rate of up to 80% during the first week of illness. These quantitative systems are potentially useful for the early diagnosis of SARS and can also provide viral load information that might assist clinicians in making a prognostic evaluation of an infected individual.","output":"Molecular Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although documentation of harm towards children and young people has existed for centuries, it was not until the 1960s that it became a specific focus for health professionals. Since that time, the importance of protective social networks has become better understood. The concept of trusted adults has come into sharper focus, with children being encouraged to develop networks of dependable adults to turn to for support in times of need. While many child protection processes highlight risks to younger children, there has been less emphasis on older children. The role of trusted adults may be particularly important during adolescence, due to burgeoning independence, developing sexuality, relationship formation, and associated vulnerabilities. While important choices relating to health and education are made during this period, there is little formal evidence relating to the impact of trusted adults on such outcomes. This review therefore aims to focus on the role and influence of trusted adults for adolescents. METHODS This study is a scoping review. A broad range of databases will be searched, including MEDLINE, ERIC, Education Abstracts, Web of Science, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and PsycINFO. Predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used, with a focus on outcomes relating to health and education. Two reviewers will blind screen papers independently at all screening stages, with conflicts being resolved by a third reviewer. Quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as unpublished (grey) literature/reports, will be included. We will use the World Health Organization's 'second decade' definition of adolescence. We aim to collate and map evidence in a broad overview and produce meta-analyses of homogenous data. Where this is not possible, a narrative summary will be produced. DISCUSSION There appears to be sparse knowledge regarding the role of trusted adults for adolescents. Potential benefits to health and wellbeing may impact on educational attainment, and vice versa. These areas are of particular relevance during the second decade, when decisions that affect future direction, achievement, and wellbeing are being made. The increased understanding of the role of trusted adults provided by this review may help to inform practice and policy and lead to potential benefits for the health and education of adolescents.

Past research has found that negative affect and frustration of basic psychological needs contribute to the development of depressive symptoms, but there is limited research which compares whether these are antecedents or concomitants of depressive symptoms. The present set of studies aimed to distinguish the differential associations of affect and need frustration on depressive symptoms. Students (N(study1) = 379; N(study2) = 235) completed measures on negative affect, need frustration (e.g., relatedness, competence, and autonomy), and depressive symptoms over an academic year and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In both samples, fully cross-lagged path models were used to examine the relation between need frustration, negative affect, and depressive symptoms over time. Across both studies, basic psychological need frustration was the only consistent predictor of both negative affect and depressive symptoms over time, suggesting that need frustration is an antecedent of depressive symptoms over time, and especially during vulnerable time periods. Additionally, in Study 2, reports from close others confirm that need frustration is the largest indicator of depressive presentation in students. These results highlight the relative importance of basic psychological need frustration in predicting depressive symptoms in university students.","output":"Unhappy or unsatisfied: distinguishing the role of negative affect and need frustration in depressive symptoms over the academic year and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed severe resource constraints on hospitals. High mortality rates of the COVID-19 have overwhelmed the resuscitation services. The constant fear of virus infection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has placed severe restrictions on the resuscitation services. Reports of poor outcomes after CPR further dampened the spirits of CPR providers. Hence we surveyed CPR practices for COVID -19 patients across hospitals in India by health care providers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey using Google Forms was initiated to collect data on performance of CPR in diagnosed cases of COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The survey's web-link was publicized using social media, and participation sought of all personnel involved in CPR delivery in COVID-19 patients. The responses received were analyzed. The main outcome measured were determination of the percentage of COVID-19 patients discharged home who were administered CPR. RESULTS: There were 248 responses from different parts of India. At the time of cardiac arrest, 194 victims had diffuse lung infiltrates, 22 had mild lung disease, while 32 had no documented lung lesion. Twenty-five victims had evidence of pulmonary embolism, 39 had cardiac involvement, and 3 had brain involvement. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 59.27% of cases but ROSC sustained in only 22.59%. 7.25% of patients, who received CPR, could be discharged home. CONCLUSION: The survey has shown reasonable survival rates after CPR administration in COVID-19 patients suffering from IHCA. We should not ignore the need to maximize live outcomes after CPR, even in COVID-19 patients.","output":"A survey of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We evaluated neurotrophin (NF) levels and their impact on in vitro cell wound healing in eye drops from differently prepared blood sources (cord blood [CB], and peripheral blood [PB]) in the same donor, to avoid intrasubject biological variability. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty healthy adult donor PB samples, and twenty CB samples acquired at the time of delivery were processed to obtain serum (S), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and S retrieved from PRP after activation with Ca-gluconate (PRP-R). The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were assessed with a Luminex xMAP (Luminex Corporation), and by using multikine kits from R&D system, and were statistically analysed in the eight different preparations. The impact of S, PRP, PPP, PRP-R from both sources on a cell line responding to NF supplementation (MIO-M1, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK) was tested with a scratch wound assay, and analysed by IncuCyte S3 equipment. RESULTS All the preparations from CB showed higher NF levels, except for BDNF where no difference was found as compared to PB. PRP showed higher NF levels with respect to S, PPP and PRP-R in this decreasing order. Younger donors in PB contributed with higher NF levels. The scratch assay showed different cell migration results, with a complete wound closure only recorded with the supplementation of CB-S, and a progressive reduction by using PRP, PRP-R, and PPP from both sources. DISCUSSION Protocols of preparation and choice of blood source determine different NF levels in the final products.

Although mesothelial cells are known to express multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which contribute to trigger innate immune responses against infections, the precise molecular mechanism remains still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll/IL-1 domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN- (TRIF), one of the two major TLRsCadaptor molecules, on innate immune response induced by TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation in murine peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). TRIF was strongly expressed in PMCs and its deficiency led to impaired production of cytokines and chemokines by poly I:C and LPS in the cells. Activation of NF-B or MAPKs through poly I:C and LPS stimulation was reduced in TRIF-deficient PMCs as compared to the WT cells. TRIF was also necessary for optimal nitric oxide synthesis and gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFN- in PMCs in response to poly I:C and LPS. Furthermore, both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced high level of IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 production in PMCs, which was significantly impaired by TRIF deficiency. These results demonstrated that TRIF is required for optimal activation of innate immune responses in mesothelial cells against microbial infections.","output":"Toll/IL-1 domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN- (TRIF) mediates innate immune responses in murine peritoneal mesothelial cells through TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundWhilst the management of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has evolved in response to the emerging data, treating such patients remains a challenge, and many treatments lack robust clinical evidence We conducted a survey to evaluate Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management of COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and compared the results with data from a similar survey focusing on Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that was conducted in 2013 MethodsThe questionnaire was refined from a previous survey of ARDS-related clinical practice using an online electronic survey engine (Survey Monkey?) and all UK intensivists were encouraged to participate The survey was conducted between 16/05/2020 and 17/06/2020 ResultsThere were 137 responses from 89 UK centres Non-invasive ventilation was commonly used in the form of CPAP The primary ventilation strategy was the ARDSnet protocol, with 63% deviating from its PEEP recommendations Similar to our previous ARDS survey, most allowed permissive targets for hypoxia (94%), hypercapnia (55%) and pH (94%) The routine use of antibiotics was common, and corticosteroids were frequently used, usually in the context of a clinical trial (45%) Late tracheostomy (&gt;7 days) was preferred (92%) Routine follow-up was offered by 66% with few centres providing routine dedicated rehabilitation programmes following discharge Compared to the ARDS survey, there is an increased use of neuromuscular agents, APRV ventilation and improved provision of rehabilitation services ConclusionsSimilar to our previous ARDS survey, this survey highlights variations in the management strategies used for patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19","output":"Intensive care physicians perceptions of the diagnosis & management of patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure associated with COVID-19: A UK based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of older Americans depend on services provided by Area Agencies on Aging to support their nutritional, social, and health needs.

Observational studies including adults with COVID-19 infection and reporting GI symptoms were included. The primary outcome was assessing the weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection. Secondary outcomes were WPP of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection with GI symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 78 studies with 12,797 patients were included. Among GI symptoms (at onset of illness in 6, at admission in 17, data given separately for both in 3, and data unavailable in 52 studies), the WPP of diarrhea was 12.4% (95% CI, 8.2% to 17.1%), I2=94%; nausea and/or vomiting, 9.0% (95% CI, 5.5% to 12.9%), I2=93%; loss of appetite, 22.3% (95% CI, 11.2% to 34.6%, I2=94%; and abdominal pain, 6.2% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%), I2=92%.

However, limited research leverages national longitudinal data to examine whether and how experiences of a range of housing insecurity events, rather than just eviction or homelessness, affect physical health among midlife and older adults. OBJECTIVE: The current study examines (1) prevalence of housing insecurity among midlife and older adults by age and race, (2) linkages between housing insecurity experiences and facets of physical health, and (3) age and race moderations on these effects. METHOD: This study employs regression models to examine whether experiences of housing insecurity affect self-rated physical health and chronic physical conditions among midlife and older adults (N = 2598) leveraging two waves of the National Study of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). RESULTS: Models revealed that housing insecurity experiences predicted poorer self-rated physical health and additional chronic conditions, even when controlling for previous physical health. Moderation analyses indicated that housing insecurity has a stronger relationship with chronic conditions among midlife adults as compared to older adults, and among Black adults as compared to white adults. These results suggest that experiences of housing insecurity leave adults vulnerable to compromised physical health, and that housing insecurity experiences may be particularly detrimental to the health of midlife Black adults. CONCLUSIONS: This research adds to the extant literature by introducing a comprehensive measure of housing insecurity experiences, and contributes to a life course perspective regarding how housing insecurity can affect physical health. This research has implications for policy that addresses housing insecurity as a public health concern, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 recession and the economic and housing crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A longitudinal analysis of the relationship between housing insecurity and physical health among midlife and aging adults in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver ablation therapy can be used for the treatment of primary and secondary liver malignancy. The increased incidence of cancer recurrence associated with this approach, has been attributed to the inability of monitoring the extent of ablated liver tissue. METHODS The feasibility of assessing liver ablation with probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) was studied in a porcine model of laparoscopic microwave liver ablation. Following the intravenous injection of the fluorophores fluorescein and indocyanine green, CLE images were recorded at 488 nm and 660 nm wavelength and compared to liver histology. Statistical analysis was performed to assess if fluorescence intensity change can predict the presence of ablated liver tissue. RESULTS CLE imaging of fluorescein at 488 nm provided good visualization of the hepatic microvasculature; whereas, CLE imaging of indocyanine green at 660 nm enabled detailed visualization of hepatic sinusoid architecture and interlobular septations. Fluorescence intensity as measured in relative fluorescence units was found to be 75-100% lower in ablated compared to healthy liver regions. General linear mixed modeling and ROC analysis found the decrease in fluorescence to be statistically significant.

However, auscultation is a subjective practice and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) where automated analyses could help decentralise care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardised collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modelling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation. METHODS: A total of 1000 consecutive, patients aged  16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e., discharge, hospitalisation, intubation and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the current episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine classifier will be trained on these audio recordings to derive an automated prediction of diagnostic (COVID positive vs negative) and risk stratification categories (mild to severe). The performance of this model will be compared to a human prediction baseline on a random subset of lung sounds, where blinded physicians are asked to classify the audios into the same categories.

RESULTS: There was a comparable significant reduction in the mean scores of waist circumference among participants in the intervention versus control arm over 12 months: I =108.7:C = 85.8 cm (P value = 0.001), I = 109.2:C = 86.02 cm (P value = 0.001), and I = 105.6:C = 87.2 cm (P value = 0.001) in the first, sixth, and twelfth months, respectively. A significant reduction in the mean scores of body mass index in the intervention versus control arm only in the first month: I =31.7:C = 26.5 cm (P value = 0.001). However, there was a comparable significant reduction in the mean scores of fasting blood glucose in the intervention versus control arm over 12 months: I =2016.5:C = 185.3 mmol/l (P value = 0.011), I = 207.4:C = 168.04 mmol/l (P value = 0.002), and I = 2012.7:C = 158.6 mmol/l (P value = 0.001) in the first, sixth, and twelfth months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of structured diabetes self-care education for diabetics by trained health educators at primary health care has a beneficiary effect on reducing the mean body mass index, waist circumference, and blood glucose. Similarly, it decreases high blood pressure.","output":"Effectiveness of diabetes self-care education at primary health care centres in Saudi Arabia: A pragmatic randomized trial in Tabuk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 places unprecedented demands on the oncology ecosystem. The extensive pressure of managing health care during the pandemic establishes the need for rapid implementation of telemedicine. Across our large statewide practice of 640 practitioners at 221 sites of service, an aggressive multidisciplinary telemedicine strategy was implemented in March by coordinating and training many different parts of our healthcare delivery system. From March to September, telemedicine grew to serve 15%-20% of new patients and 20%-25% of established patients, permitting the practice to implement safety protocols and reduce volumes in clinic while continuing to manage the acute and chronic care needs of our patient population. We surveyed practice leaders, queried for qualitative feedback, and established 76% were satisfied with the platform. The common challenges for patients were the first-time use and technology function, and patients were, in general, grateful and happy to have the option to visit their clinicians on a telemedicine platform. In addition to conducting new and established visits remotely, telemedicine allows risk assessments, avoidance of hospitalization, family education, psychosocial care, and improved pharmacy support. The implementation has limitations including technical complexity; increased burden on patients and staff; and broadband access, particularly in rural communities. For telemedicine to improve as a solution to enhance the longitudinal care of patients with cancer, payment coverage policies need to continue after the pandemic, technologic adoption needs to be easy for patients, and broadband access in rural areas needs to be a policy priority.

However, the incidence and outcomes of IPA following other RVIs is not well-described. We hypothesized that IPA may be an underreported complication of non-influenza RVIs. The objective of this study was to quantify the incidence and associated outcomes of IPA following RVI in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of adult hospitalized patients with RVI diagnosed by multiplex PCR-based assay at the University of Kansas Hospital (Kansas City, Kansas) from September 2018-October 2019. Patients with a diagnosis of proven or probable IPA prior to RVI and those with hospital admission < 24 h were excluded from analysis. Proven or probable IPA was defined according to EORTC/MSGERC consensus definitions. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 195 patients met study criteria and were included in the analysis. The most common types of RVI observed were rhinovirus/enterovirus (57.9%, n=113), parainfluenza (13.3%, n=26), influenza (8.2%, n=16), and respiratory syncytial virus (7.7%, n=15). The cumulative incidence of IPA infection within 6 weeks of RVI was 5.6% (n=11). Excluding patients co-infected with multiple respiratory viruses (n=5), IPA was numerically more likely to occur following influenza compared to non-influenza RVI (12.5% [ n=2/16] vs. 4.6% [n=8/174]; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-15.3; P=0.176). Overall, one-year all-cause mortality was 20% (n=39/195) in this cohort. Development of IPA as a complication of RVI was associated with a significant decrease in 1-year survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.19-7.78; P=0.021), and this relationship persisted after adjustment for age (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.08-7.10; P=0.034). CONCLUSION: In a cohort of hospitalized patients with RVI, 5.6% of patients developed proven or probable IPA. Although IPA was more likely to occur in patients with influenza, this complication was also observed with other types of RVI. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may be an underappreciated complication of non-influenza RVI in hospitalized patients and warrants continued study.

Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHOD: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. FINDINGS: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5% of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that diabetes is a risk factor - and contributes to the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19.

Data comparing subsets of sHLH are limited due to the rarity of this disease. We aim to explore differences in clinical features that may differentiate MAS from malignancy-associated HLH (mHLH) patients. We conducted a single-center retrospective study assessing clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment regimens and outcomes in 34 patients with sHLH over a 16 year period. We compared patients with MAS to those with mHLH. Hepatomegaly was not present in the MAS group but was present in the mHLH group (0 vs. 25%, p = 0.024). MAS patients had on average nearly double the concentration of platelets at 50.0 (IQR: 31.0C78.0 K/L) vs. 29.0 K/L (IQR: 14.0C37.5 K/L), p = 0.003.

To test whether abrogation of this H-2Db-restricted epitope, located within the spike glycoprotein at residues S510 to 518 (S510), resulted in delayed virus clearance and/or virus persistence we selected isogenic recombinants which express either the wild-type JHM spike protein (RJHM) or spike containing the N514S mutation (RJHM(N514S)), which abrogates the response to S510. In contrast to observations in suckling mice in which viruses encoding inactivating mutations within the S510 epitope (epitope escape mutants) were associated with persistent virus and increased neurovirulence (Pewe et al., J Virol. 72:5912-5918, 1998), RJHM(N514S) was not more virulent than the parental, RJHM, in 4-week-old C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice after intracranial injection. Recombinant viruses expressing the JHM spike, wild type or encoding the N514S substitution, were also selected in which background genes were derived from the neuroattenuated A59 strain of MHV. Whereas recombinants expressing the wild-type JHM spike (SJHM/RA59) were highly neurovirulent, A59 recombinants containing the N514S mutation (SJHM(N514S)/RA59) were attenuated, replicated less efficiently, and exhibited reduced virus spread in the brain at 5 days postinfection (peak of infectious virus titers in the central nervous system) compared to parental virus encoding wild-type spike. Virulence assays in BALB/c mice (H-2d), which do not recognize the S510 epitope, revealed that attenuation of the epitope escape mutants was not due to the loss of a pathogenic immune response directed against the S510 epitope. Thus, an intact immunodominant S510 epitope is not essential for virus clearance from the CNS, the S510 inactivating mutation results in decreased virulence in weanling mice but not in suckling mice, suggesting that specific host conditions are required for epitope escape mutants to display increased virulence, and the N514S mutation causes increased attenuation in the context of A59 background genes, demonstrating that genes other than that for the spike are also important in determining neurovirulence.","output":"Contributions of the viral genetic background and a single amino acid substitution in an immunodominant CD8+ T-cell epitope to murine coronavirus neurovirulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in our understanding of ADAMTS13 structure, and the conformation changes required for full activity, have rejuvenated the possibility of its use as a thrombolytic therapy.

The primary measure of efficacy in both models was restoration of rCBF to the MCA territory which was determined using laser speckle contrast imaging. The caADAMTS13 variant exhibited a constitutively active conformation and a 5-fold enhanced activity against FRETS-VWF73 compared to wild type (wt)ADAMTS13.

SETTING: Real-life setting (at home) and hospitalised patients. PARTICIPANTS: All volunteers aged >18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, and having completed the PA questionnaire (n=452). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was disease severity (asymptomatic, mild illness and moderate illness). The secondary outcomes were self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: From the 452 patients included, 216 (48%) were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 (31C51) years, 59 (13%) were classified as asymptomatic, 287 (63%) as mild illness and 106 (24%) as moderate illness. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (n=294; 65%), headache (n=281; 62%) and dry cough (n=241; 53%). After adjustment, the highest PA level was associated with a lower risk of moderate illness (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.98, p=0.045), fatigue (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97, p=0.040), dry cough (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, p=0.034) and chest pain (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77, p=0.010).

Using the most predictive items to predict future psychological resilience resulted in a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 72.7C74.3% in the HUS sample. Similar performances (BAC = 67C77%) were observed in the two independent validation samples. The models' predictions translated to a high probability of sickness absence during the pandemic. Our results provide the first evidence that ML techniques could be harnessed for the early detection of COVID-19-related distress among HCWs, thereby providing an avenue for potential targeted interventions.","output":"A machine learning approach to predict resilience and sickness absence in the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is characterized by the elevation of a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators associated with poor disease outcomes. We aimed at an in-silico analysis of regulatory microRNA and their transcription factors (TF) for these inflammatory genes that may help to devise potential therapeutic strategies in the future. METHODS: The cytokine regulating immune-expressed genes (CRIEG) were sorted from literature and the GEO microarray dataset. Their co-differentially expressed miRNA and transcription factors were predicted from publicly available databases. Enrichment analysis was done through mienturnet, MiEAA, Gene Ontology, and pathways predicted by KEGG and Reactome pathways. Finally, the functional and regulatory features were analyzed and visualized through Cytoscape. RESULTS: Sixteen CRIEG were observed to have a significant protein-protein interaction network. The ontological analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. The search performed in the miRNA database yielded ten miRNAs that are significantly involved in regulating these genes and their transcription factors. CONCLUSION: An in-silico representation of a network involving miRNAs, CRIEGs, and TF, which take part in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, has been elucidated. Thus, these regulatory factors may have potentially critical roles in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may be explored further to develop targeted therapeutic strategies and mechanistic validation.","output":"MicroRNAs based regulation of cytokine regulating immune expressed genes and their transcription factors in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the condition of resource tolerance, engineering construction projects face the problem of labor force balance in the working face. Notably, a deviation occurs between the distribution and certain demand of the labor force in the limited working face, which affects the realization of an extremely short construction period. To address this problem, we first introduced the stochastic coefficient of labor force equilibrium to measure the degree of labor balance. Second, a labor force equilibrium model with the realization goal of an extremely short construction period was established. Then, the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was improved from two perspectives to solve the proposed model. The update equation was rounded to solve practical project problems, and a dynamic variable inertia weight was adopted to ensure the PSO algorithm accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, through case analysis, we determined the extremely short construction period and best labor force distribution scheme. Moreover, the case results revealed that the established model is simple, operable and practical and that the proposed algorithm achieves a high search accuracy and efficiency in the model solution process. Overall, under the condition of resource tolerance, this study provides scientific and effective references for managers to realize an extremely short construction period.","output":"Research on extremely short construction period of engineering project based on labor balance under resource tolerance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A healthy postpartum lifestyle is vital for the promotion of optimal maternal health, return to pre-pregnancy weight and prevention of postpartum weight retention, but barriers exist. We performed a systematic review that aimed to describe the barriers and facilitators to a healthy lifestyle in the first 2 years postpartum from the perspectives of women and healthcare providers. Databases were searched for eligible studies published up to 26 August 2019. Following thematic analysis, identified themes were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour model. We included 28 qualitative and quantitative studies after screening 15,643 citations and 246 full texts. We identified barriers and facilitators relating to capability (e.g., lack of knowledge regarding benefits of lifestyle behaviours; limitations in healthcare providers' skills in providing lifestyle support), opportunity (e.g., social support from partners, family, friends and healthcare providers; childcare needs) and motivation (e.g., identifying benefits of exercise and perception of personal health; enjoyment of the activity or food). We suggest intervention components to include in lifestyle interventions for postpartum women based on the identified themes.

The objectives of this study were to: 1) examine how grocery store visits changed during the early outbreak of COVID-19, and 2) estimate a model to predict the change of grocery store visits in the future, within the same phase of the pandemic. The study period (February 15?May 31, 2020) covered the outbreak and phase-one re-opening. Six counties/states in the United States were examined. Grocery store visits (in-store or curbside pickup) increased over 20% when the national emergency was declared on March 13 and then decreased below the baseline within a week. Grocery store visits on weekends were affected more significantly than those on workdays before late April. Grocery store visits in some states (including California, Louisiana, New York, and Texas) started returning to normal by the end of May, but that was not the case for some of the counties (including those with the cities of Los Angeles and New Orleans). With data from Google Mobility Reports, this study used a long short-term memory network to predict the change of grocery store visits from the baseline in the future. The networks trained with the national data or the county data performed well in predicting the general trend of each county. The results from this study could help understand mobility patterns of grocery store visits during the pandemic and predict the process of returning to normal.","output":"Predicting Grocery Store Visits During the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 with Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth, or the delivery of healthcare services from a distance, has historically been used to provide care to underserved populations and to those unable to visit a healthcare center. During the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, some providers of tinnitus healthcare services incorporated telehealth into their clinical protocols to allow for continued care for their patients while adhering to social distancing guidelines and safety measures. Bothersome tinnitus can negatively impact one's quality of life. Telehealth has been instrumental in treating this debilitating problem in a time when in-person care has not been easily available. The case of a patient with tinnitus is examined to demonstrate the use of a hybrid delivery model utilizing telehealth and in-person interactions to assess and manage her bothersome tinnitus. In-person services were used for audiological assessments and fitting of treatment devices, while telehealth was utilized for counseling, education, and remote programming of her treatment devices. This combined approach, which has allowed the patient to continue receiving care safely during the pandemic, can be continued for future care. Telehealth offers several advantages to patients and providers alike. While the COVID-19 pandemic will hopefully come to an end, telehealth services for tinnitus management may be here to stay.","output":"Tinnitus Management: The Utilization of a Hybrid Telehealth and In-Person Delivery Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has dramatically impacted urban mobility, of which public transport (PT) has been particularly affected. With PT ridership plummeting due to infection fears and many people returning to work, there is a danger of a steep rise in car use that would exacerbate environmental and health problems. Therefore, other modes such as bike sharing should be considered as potential alternatives during the coronavirus pandemic. This study focuses on assessing how coronavirus has impacted bike sharing by implementing a travel behaviour survey to the users of GIRA, the bike sharing system (BSS) of Lisbon. While the coronavirus has led some to decrease the frequency of use or quit the system, other users have increased the usage or joined GIRA during the pandemic. Furthermore, most users who have quit or decreased the usage of GIRA justify their decision not so much on avoiding the risk of infection (although for some it is an important reason) but on having stopped commuting due to COVID-19. The survey has also revealed substantial changes not only on the usage patterns of GIRA users but also on their relationship with other modes of transport. While before the pandemic, most respondents were shifting from PT to GIRA, that percentage has declined, with an increase on the share of users replacing walking, private car, and personal cycling. Moreover, the motivations for using bike sharing related with avoiding PT and maintaining a social distance during the trip have gained more relevance. Concurrently, the perceived safety of using PT has drastically declined, and while the perceived safety of using GIRA has also decreased it was in a much smaller scale. Policy insights can be derived from this research on how bike sharing can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient urban transport system. During infectious public health crises such as COVID-19, BSS can be a viable transport alternative, not only providing the population with an affordable mode of transport where social distancing can be maintained in most of the trip but also mitigating a modal shift from PT to the private car.","output":"The role of bike sharing during the coronavirus pandemic: An analysis of the mobility patterns and perceptions of Lisbons GIRA users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrocardiogram signal (ECG) is considered a significant biological signal employed to diagnose heart diseases. An ECG signal allows the demonstration of the cyclical contraction and relaxation of human heart muscles. This signal is a primary and noninvasive tool employed to recognize the actual life threat related to the heart. Abnormal ECG heartbeat and arrhythmia are the possible symptoms of severe heart diseases that can lead to death. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is one of the most common arrhythmias which begins from the lower chamber of the heart and can cause cardiac arrest, palpitation, and other symptoms affecting all activities of a patient. Nowadays, computer-assisted techniques reduce doctors' burden to assess heart arrhythmia and heart disease automatically. In this study, we propose a PVC recognition based on a deep learning approach using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Firstly, 10 heartbeat and statistical features including three morphological features (RS amplitude, QR amplitude, and QRS width) and seven statistical features are computed for each signal. The extraction process of these features is conducted for 20 s of ECG data that create a feature vector. Next, these features are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to find unique patterns and classify them more effectively. The obtained results prove that our pipeline improves the diagnosis performance more effectively.","output":"Premature Ventricular Contraction Recognition Based on a Deep Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The authors examine the Taiwanese government's budgetary responses to COVID-19, with a focus on the special budgets created for containing the virus, undertaking bailouts and providing economic stimulus The authors assess the short-term and long-term fiscal implications of the budgetary measures and discuss how Taiwan's experiences could provide lessons for other countries for future emergencies Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data from Taiwan's official documents and news reports and compare the special budgets proposed by the Taiwanese government during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic The authors discuss lessons learned from the 2008C09 special budget and possible concerns of the 2020 special budgets In the conclusions, the authors discuss potential long-term implications for Taiwan's budgetary system as well as possible lessons for other countries based on Taiwan's experiences Findings: The authors found that the 2008C09 special budgets focused only on economic stimulus, whereas the 2020 special budgets covered COVID-19 treatments, bailouts and economic stimulus In 2020, the Taiwanese government devised targeted bailout plans for industries and individuals most affected by the pandemic and created the Triple Stimulus Vouchers to boost the economy Since the special budgets were largely funded through borrowing, the authors pointed out concerns for fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity Originality/value: COVID-19 has changed how the world functions massively This work adds to the literature on COVID-19 by providing Taiwan's budgetary responses to the pandemic This work also identifies ways for Taiwan to improve the existing budgetary system and discusses lessons for other countries ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Taiwan's budgetary responses to COVID-19: the use of special budgets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are used to considering human agency as the most important aspect of the educational process.

STUDY DESIGN: Based on the classic SEITR model and combined with population mobility, a compartmental model was constructed to simulate the transmission of COVID-19 and disease progression in the Shenzhen population. METHODS: Based on published epidemiological data on COVID-19 and population mobility data from Baidu Qianxi, we constructed a compartmental model to evaluate the impact of work and traffic resumption on the epidemic in Shenzhen in various scenarios. RESULTS: Imported cases account for most (58.6%) of the early reported cases in Shenzhen. We demonstrated that with strict inflow population control and a high level of mask usage after work resumption, various resumptions resulted in only an insignificant difference in the number of cumulative infections. Shenzhen may experience this second wave of infections approximately two weeks after the traffic resumption if the incidence risk in Hubei is high at the moment of resumption. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the work resumption strategy adopted in Shenzhen, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 after its reopening was limited.

It was reported that the incidence of TE increased during the COVID\\\\19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. However, to date, there is no study evaluating the status of COVID\\\\19 before the onset of hair loss in patients with TE. The aim of this study is to evaluate the patients with TE whether they had COVID\\\\19 or not before the onset of their hair loss and to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of those with and without a history of COVID\\\\19. METHOD: We conducted an observational cohort study of TE patients. The diagnosis of TE depended on anamnesis and physical examination of the patients. Also, hair pull test was performed. Demographic data and the results of COVID\\\\19 real\\\\time polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) were recorded from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: Totally, 181 patients with TE were included in the study. Sixty\\\\four of patients (35.4%) had been diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 before the hair loss started. The median duration of development of hair loss was 2 months (range 1C11 months, IQR 3) after COVID\\\\19 diagnosis. In this group, 87.5% of patients (n = 56) had acute TE and 12.5% of patients (n = 8) had chronic TE. The rate of acute TE and the use of vitamin supplements were ignificantly higher (p < 0.001 and p = 0.027, respectively) and the monocyte count in peripheral blood was lower (p = 0.041) in the group diagnosed with COVID\\\\19. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It was stated that monocytes and macrophages infected by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can produce pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines that play a crucial role in the development of COVID\\\\19\\\\related complications. Also, it was suggested that the number of monocytes tends to be lower in the late recovery stage. The lower monocyte count in patients with a history of COVID\\\\19 in our study may be related to evaluating the patients in the late period of recovery and the migration of circulating monocytes to hair follicles. The history of COVID\\\\19 must be questioned in patients with TE. It should be kept in mind that hair loss that develops after COVID\\\\19 may be presented as chronic TE form too. The exact mechanisms of hair loss induced by COVID\\\\19 are not fully explained; the roles of monocytes on the hair follicles may be one of the responsible mechanisms.","output":"Evaluation of patients with telogen effluvium during the pandemic: May the monocytes be responsible for post COVID\\\\19 telogen effluvium?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed social life across the globe and had a particularly profound impact on older people.

Thus, the World Health Organization developed a One-Health surveillance project called Tricycle focusing on the prevalence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in humans, animals, and the environment. Here we present the first results of the human community component of Tricycle in Madagascar. From July 2018 to April 2019, rectal swabs from 492 pregnant women from Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Ambatondrazaka, and Toamasina were tested for ESBL-E. coli carriage. Demographic, sociological and environmental risk factors were investigated, and E. coli isolates were characterized (antibiotic susceptibility, resistance and virulence genes, plasmids, and genomic diversity). ESBL-E. coli prevalence carriage in pregnant women was 34% varying from 12% (Toamasina) to 65% (Ambatondrazaka). The main risk factor associated with ESBL-E. coli carriage was the rainy season (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3C5.6, p = 0.009). Whole genome sequencing was performed on 168 isolates from 144 participants. bla(CTXCMC15) was the most frequent ESBL gene (86%). One isolate was resistant to carbapenems and carried the bla(NDMC5) gene. Most isolates belonged to commensalism associated phylogenetic groups A, B1, and C (90%) and marginally to extra-intestinal virulence associated phylogenetic groups B2, D and F (10%). Multi locus sequence typing showed 67 different sequence types gathered in 17 clonal complexes (STc), the most frequent being STc10/phylogroup A (35%), followed distantly by the emerging STc155/phylogroup B1 (7%), STc38/phylogroup D (4%) and STc131/phylogroup B2 (3%). While a wide diversity of clones has been observed, SNP analysis revealed several genetically close isolates (n = 34/168) which suggests human-to-human transmissions. IncY plasmids were found with an unusual prevalence (23%), all carrying a bla(CTXCMC15). Most of them (85%) showed substantial homology (85%) suggesting a dissemination of IncY ESBL plasmids in Madagascar. This large-scale study reveals a high prevalence of ESBL-E. coli among pregnant women in four cities in Madagascar associated with warmth and rainfall.

Moreover, the hospital admission and PCR positivity rates have not been assessed and compared yet. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lebanon and identify risk factors for severe disease or death. Study design: This is a retrospective mono-center cohort study in which we used patients files to extract and analyse data on demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as mortality. Moreover, we tracked the pandemic by recording the daily total and ICU inpatient census and the PCR positivity rate for admitted and outpatients. Results: Although the total admission rate increased from September to April, the ICU census switched this trend in December to stabilize at an average of around 10 patients/day until April. The case fatality rate was 19% for the 902 hospitalized patients, of which the majority (80%) had severe COVID-19. The severity odds ratio is significantly decreased in immunosuppressed cases (OR, 0.18; CI, 0.05-0.67; p=0.011). Additionally, the odds of COVID-19 related death are significantly greater if consolidations are found in the chest computed tomography (CT) scan (OR, 12; CI, 2.63-55.08; p=0.0013).

This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO(2) emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO(2) emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO(2) emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery.

DESIGN: Quasi-experimental cluster-control outbreak evaluation. METHODS: All patients and staff on the outbreak ward (case cluster), and randomly selected patients and staff on COVID-19 wards (positive control cluster) and a non-COVID-19 wards (negative control cluster) underwent reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, detection of environmental SARS-COV-2 RNA, patient behavior, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody prevalence were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 145 staff and 26 patients were exposed, resulting in 24 secondary cases. Also, 4 of 14 (29%) staff and 7 of 10 (70%) patients were asymptomatic or presymptomatic. There was no difference in mean cycle threshold between asymptomatic or presymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals. None of 32 randomly selected staff from the control wards tested positive. Environmental RNA detection levels were higher on the COVID-19 ward than on the negative control ward (OR, 19.98; 95% CI, 2.63C906.38; P < .001). RNA levels on the COVID-19 ward (where there were no outbreaks) and the outbreak ward were similar (OR, 2.38; P = .18). Mean monthly hand hygiene compliance, based on 20,146 observations (over preceding year), was lower on the outbreak ward (P < .006).

In this paper, we report a case of a 39-year-old male with excessive body weight and a history of borderline values of arterial hypertension without therapy, who was mainly complaining of progressive dyspnea after being diagnosed with mild COVID-19. According to the recent guidelines on the holistic assessment and management of patients who had COVID-19, all preferred diagnostic procedures, including multidetector computed tomography (CT), CT pulmonary angiogram, and echocardiography, should be conducted. However, in our patient, no underlying cardiopulmonary disorder has been established. Therefore, considering all additional symptoms our patient had beyond dyspnea, our initial differential diagnosis included anxiety-related dysfunctional breathing. However, psychiatric evaluation revealed that our patient had only a mild anxiety level, which was unlikely to provoke somatic complaints. We decided to perform further investigations considering that cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) represents a reliable diagnostic tool for patients with unexplained dyspnea. Finally, the CPET elucidated the diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, which was the most probable cause of progressive dyspnea in our patient. We suggested that, based on uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors our patient had, COVID-19 triggered a subclinical form of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) to become clinically manifest.

However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic? Methods: Using electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (2017-2020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions (including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions ('lockdown') compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020. Findings: The overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017. Primary care contacts for all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58). Interpretation: There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future public health planning (including further restrictions).

METHODS: The EuGMS gathered experts to propose a guide of measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs. It is based on the specific features of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LTCFs, residents needs, and on experiences conducted in the field. RESULTS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 residents and staff members contribute substantially to the dissemination of COVID-19 infection in LTCFs. An infection prevention and control focal point should be set up in every LTCF for (1) supervising infection prevention and control measures aimed at keeping COVID-19 out of LTCFs, (2) RT-PCR testing of residents, staff members, and visitors with COVID-19 symptoms, even atypical, and (3) isolating subjects either infected or in contact with infected subjects. When a first LCTF resident or staff member is infected, a facility-wide RT-PCR testCretest strategy should be implemented for detecting all SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Testing should continue until no new COVID-19 cases are identified. The isolation of residents should be limited as much as possible and associated with measures aiming at limiting its negative effects on their mental and somatic health status.

In addition to their lipid-lowering effects, increasing evidence supports the existence of several additional beneficial, 'pleiotropic' effects of statins. Recently, several studies have indicated that statins may attenuate myocarditis. Statins modify the lipid oxidation, inflammation, immunomodulation, and endothelial activity of the pathophysiology and have been recommended as adjuvant treatment. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of action of statins and their effects on myocarditis, SARS-CoV-2 and CVD.","output":"Effects of statins on myocarditis: A review of underlying molecular mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS This systematic review critically evaluated peer-reviewed publications describing morphological features consistent with, or using terms related to, a 'neuroma' or 'microneuroma' in the human cornea using laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). METHODS The review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020160038). Comprehensive literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and the Cochrane Library in November 2019. The review included primary research studies and reviews that described laser-scanning IVCM for examining human corneal nerves. Papers had to include at least one of a pre-specified set of keyword stems, broadly related to neuromas and microneuromas, to describe a corneal nerve feature. RESULTS Twenty-five papers (20 original studies; 5 reviews) were eligible. Three original studies evaluated corneal nerve features in healthy eyes. Most papers assessed corneal nerves in ocular and systemic conditions; seven studies did not include a control/comparator group. There was overlap in terminology used to describe nerve features in healthy and diseased corneas (eg, bulb-like/bulbous, penetration, end/s/ing). Inspection of IVCM images within the papers revealed that features termed 'neuromas' and 'microneuromas' could potentially be physiological corneal stromal-epithelial nerve penetration sites. We identified inconsistent definitions for terms, and limitations in IVCM image acquisition, sampling and/or reporting that may introduce bias and lead to inaccurate representation of physiological nerve characteristics as pathological. CONCLUSION These findings identify a need for consistent nomenclature and definitions, and rigorous IVCM scanning and analysis protocols to clarify the prevalence of physiological, as opposed to pathological, corneal nerve features.","output":"Identification of presumed corneal neuromas and microneuromas using laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the field of diagnostic microbiology, rapid molecular methods are critically important for detecting pathogens. With rapid and accurate detection, preventive measures can be put in place early, thereby preventing loss of life and further spread of a disease. From a preparedness perspective, early detection and response are important in order to minimize the consequences. During the past 2 decades, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have changed the playing field of molecular methods. Today, it is within reach to completely sequence the total microbiological content of a clinical sample, creating a metagenome, in a single week of laboratory work. As new technologies emerge, their dissemination and capacity building must be facilitated, and criteria for use, as well as guidelines on how to report results, must be established. This article focuses on the use of metagenomics, from sample collection to data analysis and to some extent NGS, for the detection of pathogens, the integration of the technique in outbreak response systems, and the risk-based evaluation of sample processing in routine diagnostics labs.

This initiative, implemented between 9 February 2021 and 15 June 2021, included virtual engagement between technical experts and participants during a 15-session interactive webinar series as well as web and text-messaging discussions in English and French. METHODS: This article uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze survey data collected following each webinar and a post-series survey conducted after the series had concluded. Participant data were tracked for each session, and feedback surveys were conducted after each session to gauge experience quality and content usability. Chi-square tests were used to compare results across professions (health workers, public health practitioners, and others). RESULTS: The COVID-19 Vaccination: Building Global Capacity webinar series reached participants in 179 countries or 93% of the WHO Member States; 75% of participants were from low- and middle-income countries. More than 60% of participants reported using the resources provided during the sessions, and 47% reported sharing these resources with colleagues. More than 79% of participants stated that this initiative significantly improved their confidence in preparing for and rolling out COVID-19 vaccinations; an additional 20% stated that the initiative somewhat improved their confidence. In the post-series survey, 70% of participants reported that they will definitely use the knowledge derived from this learning series in their work; an additional 20% will probably use and 9% would possibly use this knowledge in their work. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 Vaccination: Building Global Capacity learning initiative used a digital model of dynamic, interactive learning at scale. The initiative enhanced WHOs ability to disseminate knowledge, provide normative guidance, and share best practices to COVID-19 vaccination stakeholders in real time. This approach allowed WHO to hear the information needs of stakeholders and respond by developing guidance, tools, and training to support COVID-19 vaccine introduction. WHO and its partners can learn from this capacity-building experience and apply best practices for digital interactive learning to other health programs moving forward.","output":"Building global capacity for COVID-19 vaccination through interactive virtual learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The abrupt reduction in the human activities during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented changes in the background atmospheric conditions. Several studies reported the anthropogenic and air quality changes observed during the lockdown. However, no attempts are made to investigate the lockdown effects on the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and background instability processes. In this study, we assess the lockdown impacts on the ABL altitude and instability parameters (Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Convective Inhibition Energy (CINE)) using WRF model simulations. Results showed a unique footprint of COVID-19 lockdown in all these parameters. Increase in the visibility, surface temperature and wind speed and decrease in relative humidity during the lockdown is noticed. However, these responses are not uniform throughout India and are significant in the inland compared to the coastal regions. The spatial variation of temperature (wind speed) and relative humidity shows an increase and decrease over the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) and central parts of India by 20% (100%) and 40%, respectively. Increase (80%) in the ABL altitude is larger over the IGP and central parts of India during lockdown of 2020 compared to similar time period in 2015C2019. This increase is attributed to the stronger insolation due to absence of anthropogenic activity and other background conditions. At the same time, CAPE decreased by 98% in the IGP and central parts of India, where it shows an increase in other parts of India. A prominent strengthening of CINE in the IGP and a weakening elsewhere is also noticed. These changes in CAPE and CINE are mainly attributed to the dearth of saturation in lower troposphere levels, which prevented the development of strong adiabatic ascent during the lockdown.

Polarization was confirmed by surface marker expression using flow cytometry. As a comparison, monocytes were also isolated from septic patients (n=3) and analyzed for polarization markers. The effect of AA on monocyte polarization was evaluated. As a functional assay, AA-treated monocytes were analyzed for cytokine production of TNF and IL-8 by intracellular staining and flow cytometry following activation with LPS or LTA. Measurements and Main Results Both LPS and LTA induced polarization in healthy monocytes in vitro, with increased expression of both pro- (CD40 and PDL1, p<0.05) and anti-inflammatory (CD16 and CD163, p<0.05) polarization markers, with non-significant effects on CD86 and CD206. This pattern resembled, at least partly, that of monocytes from septic patients. Treatment with AA significantly inhibited the upregulation of surface expression of CD16 and CD163 (p<0.05) in a dose dependent manner, but not CD40 or PDL-1. Finally, AA attenuated LPS or LTA-induced cytokine production of IL-8 and TNF in a dose-dependent manner (both p<0.05).

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of a large database comprising 13 hospitals, serving 3.6 million patients in Southern California. Patients 18 years and older undergoing elective colorectal resection over a 3-year period were included. The crude incidence rates were calculated, and relative risks of ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction were determined using multivariable proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred and thirteen patients underwent 4765 colorectal resections between August 2008 and August 2011. Fifty-nine percent of the cases were performed laparoscopically; the median age was 63 years, and 49% were males. Colorectal carcinoma (45%) and diverticulitis (18%) were the most common indications for surgery. The median follow-up was 2.4 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates of ventral hernia at 1, 2, and 3 years among the open cohort were significantly higher at 10.1, 17.0, and 20.5%, compared to 5.7, 8.7, and 10.8% in the laparoscopic cohort (p < 0.001). Similarly, small bowel obstruction was higher in the open compared to the laparoscopic group (open 10.4, 15.0, and 18.3% vs. laparoscopic 2.7, 4.4, and 5.5%, p < 0.001). Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection were less likely to develop ventral hernia [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.64 (95% CI 0.52, 0.80); p < 0.0001] and small bowel obstruction [AHR 0.41 (95% CI 0.31, 0.54); p < 0.0001].

However, its pollution is of great concern due to agricultural activities in the region and the extensive use of pesticides. In a long term, this practice leads to environmental pollution, especially to the aquatic system. The objective of this study was to analyze the physicochemical characteristics, metals and pesticides levels in water samples obtained before and after the planting and pesticides' application season from three sites: Uruguay River and two minor affluents, Mezomo Dam and Salso Stream. For biomonitoring, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used, which were exposed for 24 h. We did not find any significant alteration in physicochemical parameters. In the pre- and post-pesticides' samples we observed a residual presence of three pesticides (tebuconazole, imazethapyr, and clomazone) and metals which levels were above the recommended (As, Hg, Fe, and Mn). Exposure to both pre- and post-pesticides' samples impaired C. elegans reproduction and post-pesticides samples reduced worms' survival rate and lifespan. PCA analysis indicated that the presence of metals and pesticides are important variables that impacted C. elegans biological endpoints. Our data demonstrates that Uruguay River and two affluents are contaminated independent whether before or after pesticides' application season.

This study aimed to: i) assess the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout in UK doctors and final year medical students during the pandemic, and ii) analyse the hypothesised relationships between psychological flexibility, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience with these mental health outcomes. Methods A cross-sectional online study of UK-based doctors and final year medical students was conducted between 27/09/2020 and 31/01/2021. Outcomes were measured using the PHQ9, GAD7, PCL-5, and aMBI. Independent variables included the CompACT-SF, IUS-12, and CD-RISC-10. Descriptive statistics, between-group analyses, and multiple regression were performed. Results Prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 26.3%, depression 21.9%, PTSD 11.8%, and burnout 10.8%. Psychological flexibility negatively predicted all outcomes, apart from low personal achievement. Intolerance of uncertainty positively predicted anxiety and PTSD scores. Resilience negatively predicted scores on burnout subscales.

Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody designated S2X259, which recognizes a highly conserved cryptic epitope of the receptor-binding domain and cross-reacts with spikes from all clades of sarbecovirus. S2X259 broadly neutralizes spike-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429), as well as a wide spectrum of human and potentially zoonotic sarbecoviruses through inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the receptor-binding domain.

PURPOSE: To (1) evaluate the clinical efficacy of a characterized PRP product prepared in a standardized manner and in a closed-system for the treatment of KOA and to (2) evaluate the association of the clinical response to PRP-related variables. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: We recruited 130 patients with nonoperative KOA and evaluated them for 1 year. PRP was prepared from a donation of autologous blood, obtaining 3 aliquots of approximately 10mL of product, which were frozen, allowing platelet disruption, platelet factor release, and long-term storage, until administration. Patients were treated 3 consecutive times every 4 weeks with an intra-articular PRP knee injection under sterile conditions. Complete blood count was performed on the whole-blood sample and the processed PRP before freezing it, for product quality assessment. Patients were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and basic satisfaction scale at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after intervention. RESULTS: Quality assessment confirmed a leukocyte-poor PRP product (white blood cell count, 0.09  0.09  10(9)/L) with a high platelet purity (platelet count, 630.86  191.75  10(9)/L).

The purpose of the study was to present the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Military Medical Academy, Sofia, Bulgaria. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted for a period of 3 months from March 2020 to June 2020 on this infection in our hospital. All participants were laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19. RT-PCR was performed for etiological diagnosis. The hospitalized patients were divided into two groups on admission, that is, nonsevere and severe. Results: One hundred thirty-eight COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and analyzed during the study period. The mean age was 52.9 years. Male was the dominant sex (sex ratio: male/female = 1/0.6). The leading clinical signs were fever, fatigue, cough, and headache. On comparative analysis of both groups (nonsevere and severe) was measured significant elevation of white blood cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.238; p value = 0.006), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.021; p < 0.001), creatinine (OR = 1.037; p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 1.014; p = 0.040), lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 1.004; p < 0.001), ferritin (OR = 1.002; p < 0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 2.028; p < 0.001), and d-dimer (OR = 2.162; p = 0.002) in severe group than in nonsevere group. Interleukin 6 was tested in 17.4% of patients and high value was found-38.6 pg/mL (95% confidence interval: 16.5-60.7). Conclusion: The first Bulgarian retrospective study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was presented. Older age, male sex, comorbidity, and signs of dyspnea and nausea were estimated as higher risk factors for severe form.

Women fall through the cracks of the healthcare system due to gender-biased norms and poorer socioeconomic status. METHODS: This study uses COVID-19 sex-disaggregated data from 133 countries. Using bootstrapping and imputation methods and heteroscedastic linear regression model, it investigates the effect of biological factors and gender norms on reported differences in male and female COVID-19 case and death rates. RESULTS: Gender norms are significant factors explaining such differences. Countries, where women experience more discrimination in families and have less access to resources, education and finance, report larger differences between male and female rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. CONCLUSION: Women's lower access to healthcare due to social norms, financial and non-financial barriers may affect women's testing for COVID-19 and access to adequate care, and result in underreported female cases and deaths from COVID-19.","output":"Women, men and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed doctor-patient communication, stripping away moments of connection that define the humanism of medicine.

This study aims to determine the per patient costs of both HOSENG trial arms. Method: We conducted a micro-costing study to estimate the cost of home-based HIV testing with (HOSENG intervention arm) and without (HOSENG control arm) secondary self-test distribution from a provider's perspective. A mixture of top-down and bottom-up costing was used. We estimated both the financial and economic per patient costs of each possible testing cascade scenario. The costs were adjusted to 2018 US$. Results: The overall provider cost for delivering the home-based HIV testing with secondary distribution was US$36,481 among the 4,174 persons enumerated and 3,094 eligible for testing in the intervention villages compared to US$28,620 for 3,642 persons enumerated and 2,727 eligible for testing in the control. The cost per person eligible for testing was US$11.79 in the intervention vs. US$10.50 in the control. This difference was mainly driven by the cost of distributed oral self-tests. The cost per person tested was, however, lower in intervention villages (US$15.70 vs. US$22.15) due to the higher testing coverage achieved through self-test distribution. The cost per person confirmed new HIV+ was US$889.79 in the intervention and US$753.17 in the control. Conclusion: During home-based HIV testing in Lesotho, the secondary distribution of self-tests for persons absent or refusing to test during the visit reduced the costs per person tested and thus presents a promising add-on for such campaigns.

Its application has been extended to duodenal to complicated ulcer means of a complementary operation aiming to solve the complication. With the aim of evaluating the proximal gastric vagotomy in the treatment of stenosing duodenal ulcers the clinical results of 80 consecutive patients treated with proximal gastric vagotomy plus vagotomy (VGP + Dp) were compared to those of a series of 106 patients submitted to selective gastric vagotomy plus antrectomy (VGS + A). These patients were evaluated for a period of 2 to 16 years after surgery. The series were homogeneous related in gender and age. Five different types of duodenoplast were performed, according to anatomic characteristics of the stenosed duodenum. In the VGS + A group the reconstruction of alimentary tract was gastroduodenal in 46 patients and gastrojejunal in 60 patients. Post operative endoscopic control showed patency of the duodenal lumen and preserved pyloric sphincter in the patients submitted to duodenoplaty. Ulcer recurrence ocurred in 5% after VGP + Dp and in 1,9% after VGS + A. Late postoperative complications such as diarrhea dumping and bilious vomiting were more frequent and more severe among the patients treated with VGS + A. Bilious vomiting did not occur and dumping and diarrhea were rare, mild and transitory after VGP + Dp. The overall clinical assessment, according to Visick classification, showed excelent results in 73% of the patients with VGP + Dp and in 42% of the patients with VGS + A; excelent and good result were found in 87% of the patients of the first group and in 76% of the second group.

This study aimed to develop an agronomic itinerary for Se biofortification of Oryza sativa L. (Poaceae) and assess potential physicochemical deviations. Trials were implemented in rice paddy field with known soil and water characteristics and two genotypes resulting from genetic breeding (OP1505 and OP1509) were selected for evaluation. Plants were sprayed at booting, anthesis and milky grain phases with two different foliar fertilizers (sodium selenate and sodium selenite) at different concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100 g Seha(?1)). After grain harvesting, the application of selenate showed 4.9C7.1 fold increases, whereas selenite increased 5.9C8.4-fold in OP1509 and OP1505, respectively. In brown grain, it was found that in the highest treatment selenate or selenite triggered much higher Se accumulation in OP1505 relatively to OP1509, and that no relevant variation was found with selenate or selenite spraying in each genotype. Total protein increased exponentially in OP1505 genotype when selenite was applied, and higher dosage of Se also increased grain weight and total protein content. It was concluded that, through agronomic biofortification, rice grain can be enriched with Se without impairing its quality, thus highlighting its value in general for the industry and consumers with special needs.","output":"Quantification and Tissue Localization of Selenium in Rice (Oryza sativa L., Poaceae) Grains: A Perspective of Agronomic Biofortification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning models are increasingly adopted for facilitating clinical decision-making.

In recent years, extensive studies on such algorithmic fairness have been conducted in machine learning in general. Yet, the understanding of how algorithmic bias will impact medicine and how to mitigate such bias still remains limited. The goal of this survey is to fill in this gap by providing a comprehensive review of algorithmic fairness within the scope of computational medicine, which aims at improving medicine with computational approaches. We first overview the three types of computational bias: data bias, measurement bias, and model bias. Then we summarize the fairness quantification metrics that are used in various literature.

However, little is known about the long-term follow-up (>2 months) of discharged patients. METHODS: We enrolled 527 discharged COVID-19 patients in a study from February 5 to March 11, 2020. These patients basic characteristics, imaging features, nucleic acid detection results, and antibody levels were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: of the 527 discharged patients, 32 (6.1%) had re-detectable positive (RP) nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up examinations with 11 and four detections entailing stool samples and anal swabs, respectively, rather than respiratory samples. Juveniles were more accessible to infection recurrence than other age groups, with shorter time spans for RP RNA tests (an average of 8.8 days [6.0C9.0 days]), while the reverse was true for the middle-aged group (17.5 days on average [14.0-17.5 days]). Similar improvements in the imaging features of both RP and none RP (NRP) groups were observed. Negative antibody detections in patients 3 and 6 months after discharge were 14.2% and 25.0%, respectively. Cases evidencing negative antibodies were more common among juvenile patients (40% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.03) 6 months post-discharge. CONCLUSIONS: 6.1% of 527 discharged patients showed RP status, which may be easier to be identified from stool samples than from other samples.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Open Grey and conference proceeding until May 2019. PubMed and medRxiv were updated on 31 August, 2020 for COVID-19. STUDY ELIGIBILITY: Studies reporting on agreement rates between different NAATs using clinical samples. PARTICIPANTS: Symptomatic patients with suspected upper or lower respiratory tract coronavirus infection. METHODS: The new NAAT was defined as the index test and the existing NAAT as reference standard. Data were extracted independently in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Confidence regions (CR) surrounding summary sensitivity/specificity pooled by bivariate meta-analysis are reported. Heterogeneity was assessed using meta-regression. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included; 22 including 10,181 persons before COVID-19 and 29 including 8,742 persons diagnosing SARS-CoV-2. The overall summary sensitivity was 89.1% (95% CR 84.0-92.7%), specificity 98.9% (95% CR 98.0-99.4%). Nearly all evaluated different PCRs both as index and reference standard. Real-time-RT PCR essays resulted in significantly higher sensitivity than other tests. Reference standards at high risk of bias possibly exaggerated specificity. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of studies evaluating SARS-COV-2 were 90.4% (95% CR 83.7-94.5%) and 98.1% (95% CR 95.9-99.2), respectively. SARS-COV-2 studies using lower respiratory tract samples, real-time RT-PCR and tests targeting the N, S or more than one gene showed higher sensitivity and RT-LAMP-based essays, especially when targeting only the RdRp gene, showed significantly lower sensitivity compared to other studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pooling all studies to date shows that about 10% of patients with coronavirus infections might be missed on average with PCR tests.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle. SETTING: 3 hospitals in an academic health system. PATIENTS: All people living in the greater Philadelphia region. MEASUREMENTS: The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME) (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be exceeded, and the intensity of the surge, including for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. RESULTS: Using patients with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53 days before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity. In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach 3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. LIMITATIONS: Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data across heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system's historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction.

Thus, it is critical to detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE), and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition.

The research reports on 20 qualitative interviews undertaken with a cross-section of tourism enterprises in Bela-Bela Local Municipality, Limpopo province, which is overwhelmingly oriented towards the market of domestic tourism. Major results are local businesses are financially negatively impacted by the subdued nature of domestic leisure travel together with the near total collapse of business travel as well as the imperative to conform to new COVID-19 safety and health protocols. Adaptive responses have included downsizing of businesses, including worker retrenchments, pricecutting, limited initiatives towards product diversification, energetic social media marketing and repurposing of properties. Key challenges for Bela-Bela tourism enterprises relate to immediate financial issues and most especially in the context that minimal support has been provided by national government to assist their business survival.

Currently, no in-field diagnostic exists for M. brunnea. Here, we described a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of M. brunnea. A set of six oligonucleotide primers was designed to recognize eight distinct sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of M. brunnea. The LAMP assay was optimized by the combination of high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity for the detection of less than 10 pg/L of target genomic DNA in 60 min per reaction at 65 C, whereas with PCR, there was no amplification of DNA with concentration less than 1 ng/L. Among the genomic DNA of 20 fungalisolates, only the samples containing the genomic DNA of M. brunnea changed from violet to sky blue (visible to the naked eye) by using hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye.

Evidence has shown that educational settings contain both risk and protective factors for MH. This review investigated which structural and cultural factors and interventions within educational settings promote positive MH and prevent poor MH in 4C18 year olds. Searches were conducted in PsychINFO, Embase, ERIC, ASSIA and British Education Index, and reference lists from key studies and relevant systematic reviews were hand-searched. Intervention, cohort, and qualitative studies were included. Of the 62 included papers, 36 examined cultural factors (30 social/relational and six value-related) while 12 studies examined structural factors (eight organisational and four physical) and 14 studies examined multiple factors. There was strong evidence for the impact of positive classroom management techniques, access to physical activity, and peer mentoring on student MH. Studies examining the impact of positive school culture, teacher training in MH and parent involvement in school MH activities also found predominantly positive results for student MH, albeit the evidence was of lower quality or from a low number of studies. Few studies explicitly examined the impact of interventions on MH inequalities; those that did indicated limited if any reduction to inequalities. A very small number of studies suggested that interventions targeting those at risk of poor MH due to socioeconomic factors could successfully improve wellbeing and reduce depression, anxiety and behavioural problems. Studies exploring the effect of management and leadership strategies within schools, policies, and aspects of the physical environment other than green space were scarce or absent in the literature.

During CT examination, a bifid sternum, the abdominal hernia containing the intestines, spleen, omentum, three fetuses, a mammary mass and an incidental peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia were identified. Surgery consisted of a standard ovariohysterectomy and repair of the peritoneopericardial hernia. Primary closure of the abdominal hernia was attempted but deemed impossible even after the ovariohysterectomy, splenectomy and a partial omentectomy. An external abdominal oblique muscle flap was used to close with no tension on the cranial part of the hernia.

Cape Town has many vulnerable communities because of poverty, overcrowding and comorbidities, although it has a relatively small elderly population. Amongst the unique and early responses to the pandemic in South Africa has been the strategy of community screening and testing (CST). This process has been drawn from health department's prior adoption of a community-orientated primary care (COPC) approach, which relies on teams of community health workers working in delineated communities to prevent disease and provide early interventions for those at higher risk. The COPC principles were applied in the CST programme, which involved collaboration between facility and community-based teams, linking public health and primary care approaches, careful mapping of cases in highly vulnerable communities, targeted screening around cases, testing of those that screened positive, health education and linkage to primary care. The overall aim was to slow down transmission through early identification and isolation of diagnosed cases. Key challenges involved the designing of a screening tool with appropriate sensitivity and specificity as well as the logistics of staffing, transport, consumables, data collection and capture, security, ablutions and personal protective equipment. Key opportunities included synergies between CST and evolving commitment to COPC in the health system. Key threats were the deteriorating security situation in the most vulnerable communities because of loss of income, food insecurity and CST distrust as well as increasing turn-around-times for test results.","output":"Community-based screening and testing for Coronavirus in Cape Town, South Africa: Short report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and practicality of ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation of the inner bore of a computed tomography (CT) gantry as a means of viral decontamination. METHOD: A UV lamp (PADNUT 38 W, 253 nm UV\\\\C light tube) and UV\\\\C dosimeter (GENERAL UV\\\\C Digital Light Meter No. UV512C) were used to measure irradiance throughout the inner bore of a CT scanner gantry. Irradiance (units W/cm(2)) was related to the time required to achieve 6\\\\log viral kill (10(?6) survival fraction). RESULTS: A warm\\\\up time of ~120 s was required for the lamp to reach stable irradiance. Irradiance at the scan plane (z = 0 cm) of the CT scanner was 580.9 W/cm(2), reducing to ~350 W/cm(2) at z = 20 cm toward the front or back of the gantry. The angular distribution of irradiation was uniform within 10% coefficient of variation. A conservative estimate suggests at least 6\\\\log kill (survival fraction  10(?6)) of viral RNA within 20 cm of the scan plane with an irradiation time of 120 s from cold start. More conservatively, running the lamp for 180 s (3 min) or 300 s (5 min) from cold start is estimated to yield survival fraction <<10(?7) survival fraction within 20 cm of the scan plane.

It was considered and designed as an examination of 132 pre-service teachers (PSTs), with 68 and 64 PSTs respectively for each group. The first group before the pandemic was applied by F2F flipped classroom and the second group after the pandemic was applied by F2S flipped classroom. The results after pertaining various data analyses of class activities and questionaries showed that performance had been improved for both groups toward the course. In addition, F2F had a significant difference in PSTs' emotion and perception toward the course and made classes more interactive. The mean score values of students' emotion and perception between two groups showed that the difference between these mean values were significant, suggesting a very large effect. Particularly, the effect size (ES) showed that positive emotions were more significant with different variables and the items Q7CQ9 of questionnaires indicated more significant different perceptions for both F2F and F2S after completing the course. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) test described that F2F answers were located mainly in the positive emotion, while F2S answers were grouped in the negative emotion, while no differences were observed for PSTs perceptions to the flipped methodology. Consequently, although F2FCF2S transition was an effective process, instructors and PSTs faced difficulties in the platform usage for online lectures reflecting emotions' results in F2S group. Thus, by solving the problems raised, it will allow PSTs to be more interactive in a virtual and online context for their future implementation by giving them active instruction methodology and educating future students to teach STEM contents.","output":"A STEM Course Analysis During COVID-19: A Comparison Study in Performance and Affective Domain of PSTs Between F2F and F2S Flipped Classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: The COVID-19 lockdown includes restrictive measures and temporary health system reorganization.

The existence of evaluation gaps can give rise to questions about the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to perform research, i.e. how field-specific notions of quality compete with notions captured via evaluation metrics, and consequently how researchers manage the balancing act between intrinsic values and requirements of evaluation procedures. This study analyses the evaluation gap from a rational choice point of view for the case of observational astronomers, based on a literature review and 19 semi-structured interviews with international astronomers. By taking a close look at the role of institutional norms and different forms of capital - such as funding, publication rates and granted telescope time - at play in astronomy, light can be shed on the workings of the balance act and its consequences on research quality in astronomy. We find that astronomers experience an anomie; they want to follow their intrinsic motivation to pursue science in order to push knowledge forward, while at the same time following their extrinsic motivation to comply with institutional norms. The balance act is the art of serving performance indicators in order to stay in academia, while at the same time compromising research quality as little as possible. Gaming strategies shall give the appearance of compliance, while institutionalised means how to achieve a good bibliometric record are used in innovative ways, such as salami slicing or going for easy publications.

This study aimed to characterize current surgeon impressions about LESS and to determine the relative difficulty of performing a simulated LESS task using a multiport access device. METHODS This study was conducted at the 2009 Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Learning Center. The 56 study participants were asked to complete pre- and post-test questionnaires regarding their level of training, prior clinical experience, and opinions about LESS. Technical skill performance was evaluated using the standardized fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery Peg Transfer task scored according to time and error metrics. The participants completed three repetitions: conventional laparoscopy (LAP), LESS with nonarticulated instruments (LESS Straight), and LESS with articulated instruments (LESS Articulating). RESULTS Complete data were collected for 45 (80%) of the 56 participants, which included 27 practicing surgeons, nine minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fellows, seven residents, and two allied health professionals. Five surgeons (LESS experienced) had managed at least one LESS case in the preceding 6 months. Participants rated their comfort with LESS as 2.0  1.2 (5-point scale, 1 = very uncomfortable). Compared with conventional laparoscopy, the participants indicated that LESS had 97% better cosmesis, 25% decreased postoperative pain, 18% faster recovery, 97% more demanding, 73% increased rate of complications, and 82% anticipated wide adoption. They all indicated a readiness to offer LESS to their patients if appropriately trained.

Other factors, such as sex, also play an important role in determining behavioral and neurochemical responses to drugs of abuse. In these studies, we sought to develop a protocol for vaporized e-cigarette nicotine self-administration in rats, as a foundation to better understand the differing effects of nicotine exposure routes on behavior and physiological function. We report a novel method that elicits robust nicotine vapor self-administration in male and female rats. Our findings indicate that 5-mg/ml nicotine vape solution provides a high level of consistency in lever-pressing behavior for both males and females. Moreover, in male rats, we find that such e-cigarette nicotine vapor induces similar blood levels of nicotine's main metabolite, cotinine, as that found with intravenous nicotine self-administration. Therefore, the breathing pattern during vapor exposure in males leads to similar levels of titrated nicotine intake as with intravenous nicotine self-administration. Interestingly, a differential effect was found in the females, in which the same conditions of vapor exposure led to decreased cotinine levels with vapor compared to intravenous self-administration. Finally, differences in nicotine-mediated locomotion provide further support of the physiological effects of e-cigarette vapor inhalation. Taken together, our findings reveal important sex differences in nicotine intake based on the route of exposure, and we further establish a protocol for nicotine vapor self-administration in rats.","output":"Nicotine e-cigarette vapor inhalation and self-administration in a rodent model: Sex- and nicotine delivery-specific effects on metabolism and behavior."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research explored the implementation of concept of Surakarta ecocultural city platform in the era of Pandemic COVID-19 in 2 case study areas of Balekambang Park as the Natural and Heritage Park and Jayengan Jewelry Kampung (JKP) as Heritage Creative Industry-based Kampung Tourism.

RESULTS Technical success was 88% and the retrograde approach was utilized in 41%. Mean CL, J-CTO and PROGRESS CTO scores were 3.91.9, 2.61.2 and 1.41.0, respectively. All scores were inversely associated with technical success (p<0.001 for all) and had moderate discriminatory capacity (area under the curve 0.691 for the CL score, 0.682 for the J-CTO score and 0.647 for the PROGRESS CTO score [p=non-significant for pairwise comparisons]).

Moreover, the impact of respiratory disease in cows varies with the stage of lactation when the disease is detected. In general, intense management practices facilitate the detection of respiratory disorders in dairy cattle herds relative to beef cattle herds. Thus, we propose that study of respiratory disease incidence in a large dairy cattle data set as paradigm to advance the knowledge on the factors influencing the incidence of this disease across cattle types. Respiratory disease information on 6,283 Holstein cows across four U.S. states and nine herds were evaluated. Two descriptors of respiratory disease were evaluated: days in milk to respiratory disease detection and the binary detection of respiratory disease. Survival analysis was used to study the days in milk-to-disease. The binary variable respiratory disease detection was analyzed using a binary logistic model. Lactation number, season, region, farm, body condition score, and milk yield level (3 levels) were included in the model as fixed explanatory effects whereas sire was considered a random effect. Incidence of respiratory disease was lower in summer relative to winter, and there was a nonsignificant trend on lactation number. Body condition score had a significant effect, with higher body condition score associated with lower incidence of respiratory disease. Farm, body condition score, and milk yield level had significant effect on the time when respiratory disease was identified. The heritability estimate for incidence of respiratory disease was 0.4, suggesting that despite the high number of potential causative agents, selection for less susceptible cattle can be an effective strategy to reduce the impact of this disease. The heritability estimate of the days in milk-to-disease was 0.13, showing that non-genetic components may play an important role on the stage of the lactation when the disease is detected.

Growing evidence suggests that a child's SARS-CoV-2 infection is often mild or asymptomatic and that children may not be major SARS-CoV-2 transmitters; thus, it is questionable if school closures prevent transmission significantly. This question is important as a majority of children in low- and middle-income countries depend on free school meals; unexpected long-term school closure may adversely impact nutrition and educational outcomes.

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath, and acute inflammatory lung injury (ALI). In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the \\"cytokine-storm syndrome.\\" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the \\"cytokine-storm syndrome.\\" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected during the care process for COVID-19 positive patients discharged from facilities affiliated with a large healthcare system in the United States as of April 27, 2020. Patients were categorized by treatment with HCQ (in addition to standard supportive therapy) or receipt of supportive therapy with no HCQ. Patient outcomes were evaluated for in-hospital mortality.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64).

The unique feature of the work is its application in the symptomatic treatment of the COVID-19 disease. For this purpose, the idea of FFSS is introduced which is based on the Senapati and Yagars Fermatean fuzzy set. Next we have defined Fermatean fuzzy soft aggregation operators (FFSAOs) like, Fermatean fuzzy soft weighted averaging (FFSWA) operator, Fermatean fuzzy soft ordered weighted averaging (FFSOWA) operator, Fermatean fuzzy soft weighted geometric (FFSWG) operator and Fermatean fuzzy soft ordered weighted geometric (FFSOWG). The prominent properties of these operators are given in details. We have also developed some approaches to solve multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems in Fermatean fuzzy soft (FFS) information. An introduction to the novel pandemic, safety measures, and then its possible symptomatic treatment is also provided. The developed operators are utilized in the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 disease in order to show the practical applications and importance of these AOs as well as Fermatean fuzzy soft information.

To regulate this activity, macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove covalently attached ADP-ribose from protein targets. All members of the Coronavirinae, a subfamily of positive-sense RNA viruses, contain a highly conserved macrodomain within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). However, its function or targets during infection remain unknown. We identified several macrodomain mutations that greatly reduced nsp3s de-ADP-ribosylation activity in vitro. Next, we created recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains with these mutations. These mutations led to virus attenuation and a modest reduction of viral loads in infected mice, despite normal replication in cell culture. Further, macrodomain mutant virus elicited an early, enhanced interferon (IFN), interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), and proinflammatory cytokine response in mice and in a human bronchial epithelial cell line. Using a coinfection assay, we found that inclusion of mutant virus in the inoculum protected mice from an otherwise lethal SARS-CoV infection without reducing virus loads, indicating that the changes in innate immune response were physiologically significant. In conclusion, we have established a novel function for the SARS-CoV macrodomain that implicates ADP-ribose in the regulation of the innate immune response and helps to demonstrate why this domain is conserved in CoVs.","output":"The Conserved Coronavirus Macrodomain Promotes Virulence and Suppresses the Innate Immune Response during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contribution of transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs in the immune response to COVID-19 and their relationship to disease outcome is not fully understood. Analysis of genome-wide changes in transcription at both promoter-proximal and distal cis-regulatory DNA elements, collectively termed the active cistrome, offers an unbiased assessment of TF activity identifying key pathways regulated in homeostasis or disease. Here, we profiled the active cistrome from peripheral leukocytes of critically ill COVID-19 patients to identify major regulatory programs and their dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We identified TF motifs that track the severity of COVID-19 lung injury, disease resolution, and outcome. We used unbiased clustering to reveal distinct cistrome subsets delineating the regulation of pathways, cell types, and the combinatorial activity of TFs. We found critical roles for regulatory networks driven by stimulus and lineage determining TFs, showing that STAT and E2F/MYB regulatory programs targeting myeloid cells are activated in patients with poor disease outcomes and associated with single nucleotide genetic variants implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Integration with single-cell RNA-seq found that STAT and E2F/MYB activation converged in specific neutrophils subset found in patients with severe disease.

Mask fit-testing of respiratory protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers from aerosolized particles. AIM: To analyse the outcome of mask fit-testing across National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 NHS hospitals were approached on May 26th, 2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit-testing at each site. FINDINGS: Ninety-six hospitals responded to the request between May 26th, 2020 to October 29th, 2020. There was a total of 86 mask types used across 56 hospitals, 13 of which were used in at least 10% of these hospitals; the most frequently used was the FFP3M1863, used by 92.86% of hospitals. Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 hospitals with mean pass rate of 80.74%. The most successful masks, in terms of fit-test failure rates, were the Alpha Solway 3030V and the Alpha Solway S-3V (both reporting mean fit-test failures of 2%). Male- and female-specific pass and failure rates were provided by seven hospitals. Across the seven hospitals, 20.1% of men tested failed the fit-test for all masks used, whereas 19.9% of women tested failed the fit-test for all masks used. Failure rates were significantly higher in staff from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds 644/2507 (25.69%) across four hospitals. CONCLUSION: Twenty percent of healthcare workers tested during the first response to the pandemic failed fit-testing for masks.

This study aimed to explore the early predictors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a case-control study of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Cases were defined as patients admitted to ICU during the period February 29 - May 29, 2020. For each case enrolled, one control was matched by age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 1560 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Each group included 780 patients with a predominant male gender (89.7%) and a median age of 49 years (interquartile range = 18). Predictors independently associated with ICU admission were cardiovascular disease (CVD) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16 - 2.32, p=0.005), diabetes (aOR=1.52, 95% CI: 1.08 - 2.13, p= 0.016), obesity (aOR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.08, p= 0.034), lymphopenia (aOR=2.69, 95% CI: 1.80-4.02, p< 0.001), high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (aOR= 2.59, 95% CI: 1.53-4.36, p< 0.001), high ferritin (aOR=1.96, 95% CI: 1.40-2.74, p< 0.001), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (aOR=4.09, 95% CI: 2.81-5.96, p< 0.001), and dyspnea (aOR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.77-3.54, p< 0.001).

AIM OF THE STUDY: To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intra-tracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 g/50 L/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days. Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining. RESULTS: After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated. Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants.

Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that PARP-1 interacted with nsP3 during SINV infection of NSC34 neuronal cells and was most abundantly present in replication complexes that contained plus- and minus-strand SINV RNAs 10-14 h after infection, prior to PARP-1 activation or automodification with PAR. Treatment with an inhibitor of PARP enzymic activity did not affect the interaction between nsP3 and PARP-1 or SINV replication. Co-expression of individual domains of nsP3 with PARP-1 showed that nsP3 interacted with PARP-1 through the C-terminal domain, not the N-terminal macro domain, and that phosphorylation was not required.

The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to examine whether the efficacy of BMTs applied for the improvement of compliance in pediatric patients differs between children 3C10-year-olds from single-child and multi-child families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quasi-experimental, 197 caregiver-child couples were divided into two groups: single-child group (116 couples) and multi-child group (81 couples). Children's pre- and post-treatment anxiety levels were measured by facial mood scale (FMS) and Frankl Behavior Rating Scale (FBRS), respectively. Caregivers' dental anxiety was measured by the Chinese version of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), which was included in the self-designed questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square tests, and binary multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the children between the two groups. BMTs were found to be capable of reducing children's dental anxiety (CDA): the compliance rate was 45.69C88.79% in the single-child group and 44.44C85.79% in the multi-child group pre- and post-BMTs, but there was no significant difference in the change of compliance between the two groups (p > 0.05). In the subgroup analysis, parenting style (odds ratio [OR] = 0.054, p < 0.05) and father's education (OR = 8.19, p < 0.05) affected the varies of children's compliance in the single-child group.

Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 16.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Two hundred-fifty-one patients (70%) were T3-T4. Negative lymph-nodes were observed in 71 patients (19.9%). One-hundred- seventy-nine were at least stage III. At a mean follow-up of 80.6 months, the overall and disease-free survival rates were 54.4% and 50.6%, respectively. The survival stratification based on the type of lymphadenectomy showed an overall survival rate of 43% and 65.5% in case of D1 and D2 lymphadenectomy, respectively. Based on the tumor stage the overall survival rate was 90%, 62.7%, 36.4% and the disease-free survival was 90%, 54.3%, 31.3%, for stage I, II and III, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Total or subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and adjuvant therapy for the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer proved a valuable strategy.

Control programs usually include vaccination with a modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. On occasion BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses postvaccination. Currently there are no markers for differentiating MLV strains from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study several BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole-genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included the reference BoHV-1 Cooper strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from cases presented for diagnosis. Based on SNP analyses, the viruses could be classified into groups having similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be differentiated from one another although some were closely related to each other. A number of field strains isolated from animals with a history of prior vaccination had SNP patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very distinct from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses can be associated with a prior MLV vaccination history, but more information is needed on the rate of BoHV-1 genome sequence change before irrefutable associations can be drawn.","output":"Bovine herpesvirus-1: comparison and differentiation of vaccine and field strains based on genomic sequence variation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped and harbor an unusually large (30C32 kb) positive-strand linear RNA genome. Highly pathogenic coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) in humans. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infects mice and serves as an ideal model of viral pathogenesis, mainly because experiments can be conducted using animal-biosafety level-2 (A-BSL2) containment. Human thymosin beta-4 (T4), a 43-residue peptide with an acetylated N-terminus, is widely expressed in human tissues. T4 regulates actin polymerization and functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and an antioxidant as well as a promoter of wound healing and angiogenesis. These activities led us to test whether T4 serves to treat coronavirus infections of humans. To test this possibility, here, we established a BALB/c mouse model of coronavirus infection using mouse CoV MHV-A59 to evaluate the potential protective effect of recombinant human T4 (rhT4). Such a system can be employed under A-BSL2 containment instead of A-BSL3 that is required to study coronaviruses infectious for humans. We found that rhT4 significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-A59 through inhibiting virus replication, balancing the host's immune response, alleviating pathological damage, and promoting repair of the liver. These results will serve as the basis for further application of rhT4 to the treatment of human CoV diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Recombinant Human Thymosin Beta-4 Protects against Mouse Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused a huge mayhem globally.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is the latest example of a highly infectious disease ravaging the world, since late 2019. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical models, able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease spreading dynamics and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical prevention strategies. For the reasons above we wrote this report that goes at the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease diffusion by simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of percolation models, effective description via compartmental models and the employment of temporal symmetries naturally encoded in the mathematical language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these approaches and determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology and its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the different frameworks exhibit common features such as criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance is explicitly realised. As important test of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. The models presented here are of immediate relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding of human behaviour.

Cholesterol has an important role in coronavirus entry, membrane fusion, and pathological syncytia formation, therefore cholesterol metabolic mechanisms may be promising drug targets for coronavirus infections. Moreover, cholesterol and its metabolizing enzymes or corresponding natural products exert antiviral effects which are closely associated with individual viral steps during coronavirus replication. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections are associated with clinically significant low cholesterol levels, suggesting cholesterol could function as a potential marker for monitoring viral infection status. Therefore, weaponizing cholesterol dysregulation against viral infection could be an effective antiviral strategy. In this review, we comprehensively review the literature to clarify how coronaviruses exploit host cholesterol metabolism to accommodate viral replication requirements and interfere with host immune responses. We also focus on targeting cholesterol homeostasis to interfere with critical steps during coronavirus infection.","output":"Coronavirus Infection and Cholesterol Metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza is a communicable respiratory illness that can cause serious public health hazards.

When it comes to managing the under-resourced health systems of developing countries, information-based decision making is particularly important. This paper reports findings of a self-report survey that investigated perceptions of local health managers (HMs) of their own regional HIS in Sri Lanka. Data were collected through a validated, pre-tested postal questionnaire, and distributed among a selected group of HMs to elicit their perceptions of the current HIS in relation to information generation, acquisition and use, required reforms to the information system and application of information and communication technology (ICT). Results based on descriptive statistics indicated that the regional HIS was poorly organised and in need of reform; that management support for the system was unsatisfactory in terms of relevance, accuracy, timeliness and accessibility; that political pressure and community and donor requests took precedence over vital health information when management decisions were made; and use of ICT was unsatisfactory. HIS strengths included user-friendly paper formats, a centralised planning system and an efficient disease notification system; weaknesses were lack of comprehensiveness, inaccuracy, and lack of a feedback system. Responses of participants indicated that HIS would be improved by adopting an internationally accepted framework and introducing ICT applications. Perceived barriers to such improvements were high initial cost of educating staff to improve computer literacy, introduction of ICTS, and HIS restructure. We concluded that the regional HIS of Central Province, Sri Lanka had failed to provide much-needed information support to HMS. These findings are consistent with similar research in other developing countries and reinforce the need for further research to verify causes of poor performance and to design strategic reforms to improve HIS in regional Sri Lanka.","output":"Information Support for Health Management in Regional Sri Lanka: Health Managers' Perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AgBiS2 nanocrystals are emerging optoelectronic materials due to their solution-processability, earth abundance and non-toxic properties.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 610 patients admitted to our emergency unit from March 20, 2020, until April 11, 2020, with suspicion of COVID-19 were collected. Diagnostic values of low-dose chest CT for COVID-19 were calculated using consecutive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as reference. Comparative analysis of the 199 COVID-19 positive versus 411 COVID-19 negative patients was done with identification of risk factors and predictors of worse outcome. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of low-dose CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 respectively ranged from 75% (150/199) to 88% (175/199) and 94% (386/411) to 99% (386/389), depending on the inclusion of inconclusive results. On multivariate analysis, a higher body mass index (BMI), fever, and dyspnea on admission were risk factors for COVID-19 (all p-values < 0.05). The mortality rate was 12.6% (25/199).

Many cell types possess genes that make antimicrobial peptides (AMPS) (endogenous antibiotics), recently discovered to be regulated by vitamin D. Two examples are cathelicidin and beta defensins, both bioactive against many different bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, parasites and viruses. The signal transduction pathway is triggered by sensing microorganisms via cell surface receptors, causing intracellular production of calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) and vitamin D receptors, leading to upregulation of AMP production. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations required to sustain adequate AMP production to eradicate infections are unknown. Vitamin D3 is photosynthesized in skin in amounts ranging from 10,000 (250 mcg) to 25,000 (625 mcg) International Units (IU) from 7-dehydrocholesterol after whole-body exposure to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and is impacted by many factors including geographic localities, seasonal changes and skin pigmentation. We and others have reported extended daily oral dosing with these amounts of vitamin D3 safe. We routinely observe serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 20ng/ml on new admissions, which have been reported insufficient to sustain AMP production. In contrast serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 100ng/ml have been reported after serial UVB treatments for psoriasis. Little vitamin D naturally occurs in food, and insufficient sun exposure may be causing worldwide deficiency. We review evidence suggesting that higher daily intakes of vitamin D3 than the currently recommended 600 (15 mcg) IU/day may be necessary to sustain AMP production in the face of an overwhelming infection, particularly in non-Hispanic blacks, a high risk population suffering the worst outcomes from COVID-19. We propose that increased vitamin D supplementation could provide a safe and cost-effective way to protect all populations from infections, in particular those from pandemic COVID-19.","output":"The Essential Role of Vitamin D in the Biosynthesis of Endogenous Antimicrobial Peptides May Explain Why Deficiency Increases Mortality Risk in COVID-19 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The current study investigated relationships between a history of blood donation, registration as a non-living and living organ donor, and differential motivations.

Further, blood donation history was not related to interest in learning more about being an organ donor. Compared to those not registered as an organ donor, those who were registered reported more positive organ donation motivations, but these relationships were unrelated to prior blood donation history.

The current study aimed to describe the behaviour-change content of a set of government-issued poster communications for the reopening of schools in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic in September 2020. Methods: Posters targeting physical distancing behaviours in school settings were retrieved from the Government of Ireland website for analysis. Posters were independently coded for behaviour change techniques (BCTs) using the BCT Taxonomy Version 1, a hierarchically clustered taxonomy of 93 distinct BCTs across 16 groups. The Theories and Techniques tool was used to identify mechanisms of action (MoAs) linked to each of the identified BCTs. Eight posters were independently content-analysed by two members of the research team for BCTs and linked MoAs. Results: Eight unique BCTs from six unique groups were identified in at least one poster. These BCTs were linked with 11 unique MoAs through which behaviour change is theorised to occur. Several theoretically important groups of BCTs, such as Natural Consequences, Social Support, Shaping Knowledge, and Comparison of Behaviour, were underutilised or not included in any of the posters. Conclusion: Future poster communications could benefit from including additional BCTs from key groups, particularly Natural Consequences.

METHODS: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv and Google Scholar up to 26 August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. RESULTS: We identified 1908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62C2.34] compared with people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalized cohorts (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12C2.27) and studies of PLWH across all settings (hazard ratio 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69C2.56).

The association between the onset of pneumonitis and treatment-related factors was analyzed by logistic regression. The severity of pneumonitis was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Risk factors, such as the absence or presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and LM, or other clinical factors, including smoking status before ICI administration, were analyzed. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses indicated that the amount of smoking was significantly associated with an increase in the development of all-grade pneumonitis types (odds ratio (OR) = 20.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 20.03C20.66; p = 0.029).

Although many reports have pointed out a correlation between a lower serum HDL-C and a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, the in vitro antiviral activity of HDL against SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported. HDL functionality, such as antioxidant and anti-infection, can be impaired by oxidation and glycation and a change to pro-inflammatory properties. This study compared the antiviral activity of native HDL with glycated HDL via fructosylation and native low-density lipoproteins (LDL). After 72 h of fructosylation, glycated HDL showed a typical multimerized protein pattern with an elevation of yellowish fluorescence. Glycated HDL showed a smaller particle size with an ambiguous shape and a loss of paraoxonase activity up to 51% compared to native HDL. The phagocytosis of acetylated LDL was accelerated 1.3-fold by glycated HDL than native HDL. Native HDL showed 1.7 times higher cell viability and 3.6 times higher cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2 than that of glycated HDL under 60 g/mL (approximately final 2.2 M) in a Vero E6 cell.

METHODS: We used data from the AORTA (USA) and the ABOTrauma (multinational) registries. Patients were stratified into two groups: (1) high-income countries (HICs) and (2) low-to-middle income countries (LMICs). Propensity score matching extracted 1:1 matched pairs of subjects who were from an LMIC or a HIC based on age, gender, the presence of pupillary response on admission, impeding hypotension (SBP  80), trauma mechanism, ISS, the necessity of CPR on arrival, the location of REBOA insertion (emergency room or operating room) and the amount of PRBCs transfused in the first 24 h. Logistic regression (LR) was used to examine the association of LMICs and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 817 trauma patients from 14 countries were included. Blind percutaneous approach and surgical cutdown were the preferred means of femoral cannulation in HICs and LIMCs, respectively. Patients from LMICs had a significantly higher occurrence of MODS and respiratory failure.

Women had a telephone consultation with a clinician. Routine ultrasound was not performed. Medications and a low-sensitivity pregnancy test to confirm success of treatment were collected by or delivered to the woman, with telephone support provided as needed. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 663 women choosing medical abortion at home via the NHS Lothian telemedicine abortion service between 1 April and 9 July 2020. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were completed 4 and 14 days following treatment. Regional hospital databases were reviewed to verify abortion outcomes and complications within 6 weeks. Outcome measures included efficacy, complications and acceptability. RESULTS: Almost all (642/663, 98.2%) the women were under 10 weeks gestation. For 522/663 (78.7%) women, gestation was determined using last menstrual period alone. Some 650/663 (98%) women had a complete abortion, 5 (0.8%) an ongoing pregnancy and 4 (0.6%) an incomplete abortion. No one was treated inadvertently beyond 12 weeks gestation, but one woman was never pregnant. One woman who had a pre-abortion ultrasound was later managed as a caesarean scar ectopic. There were two cases of haemorrhage and no severe infections. Some 123 (18.5%) women sought advice by telephone for a concern related to the abortion and 56 (8.4%) then attended a clinic for review.

METHODS All prerandomization and follow-up (24-48 hours) CT brain scans in IST-3 were assessed for HAS presence, location, and extent by masked raters. We assessed whether HAS grew, persisted, shrank, or disappeared at follow-up, the association with 6-month functional outcome, and effect of alteplase. IST-3 is registered (ISRCTN25765518). RESULTS HAS presence (vs absence) independently predicted poor 6-month outcome (increased Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS]) on adjusted ordinal regression analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, p < 0.001). Outcome was worse in patients with more (vs less) extensive HAS (OR 0.61, p = 0.027) but not in proximal (vs distal) HAS (p = 0.420). Increasing age was associated with more HAS growth at follow-up (OR 1.01, p = 0.013). Treatment with alteplase increased HAS shrinkage/disappearance at follow-up (OR 0.77, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in HAS shrinkage with alteplase in proximal (vs distal) or more (vs less) extensive HAS (p = 0.516 and p = 0.580, respectively). There was no interaction between presence vs absence of HAS and benefit of alteplase on 6-month OHS (p = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS IV alteplase promotes measurable reduction in HAS regardless of HAS location or extent. Alteplase increased independence at 6 months in patients with and without HAS.

We postulate that the variant MBL-2 genotypes are associated with increased susceptibility to and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN Nested case-control study. SETTING Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS Two hundred and twelve Caucasians with ARDS and 442 controls genotyped for the variant X, D, B, and C alleles of codon -221, 52, 54, and 57, respectively. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients homozygous for the variant codon 54B allele (54BB) had worse severity of illness on admission (p = .007), greater likelihood of septic shock (p = .04), and increased odds of ARDS (adjusted odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-31) when compared with heterozygotes and homozygotes for the wild-type allele. This association with ARDS was especially strong among the 311 patients with septic shock (adjusted odds ratio, 12.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-74). Among the patients with ARDS, the 54BB genotype was associated with more daily organ dysfunction (p = .01) and higher mortality (adjusted hazard rate, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10). Development of ARDS and outcomes in ARDS did not vary significantly with variant alleles of codon -221, 52, and 57, but the power to detect an effect was limited secondary to the low allele frequencies.

There is no approved vaccine and no proven treatment for this infection. Some potential treatments that have already been associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are under investigation. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a photon-based therapy that uses light to mediate a variety of metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a branch of photodynamic therapy based on the reaction between a photosensitizing agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen, which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the viral structures such as proteins and nucleic acids. This chapter aims to discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of PBMT and aPDT in the context of the novel coronavirus. Studies indicate that PBMT and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS, but we found no direct study on SARS-CoV-2. With a combination of PBMT and aPDT, we may be able to combat COVID-19 with minimal interference with pharmaceutical agents. It might improve the efficacy of PBMT and aPDT by using monoclonal antibodies and preparing new photosensitizers at the nanoscale that target the lung tissue specifically. More animal and human studies would need to take place to reach an effective protocol. This chapter would encourage other scientists to work on this new platform.","output":"Photobiomodulation and Antiviral Photodynamic Therapy in COVID-19 Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of Poland's COVID-19 medical advisory body have quit, saying that their advice has been ignored.

For residential health camps benefits often disappear as the child returns home. Furthermore, long-term effects are often not measured or reported. This paper presents the study protocol for an evaluation of an extended maintenance intervention offered to children who have completed a 10-week residential health camp at one of the five Danish Christmas Seal Houses (DCSH). The target group of DSCH is 7C14-year-olds with social, mental, and/or overweight issues and the overall aim of the camp is to increase life satisfaction and a healthy lifestyle. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the maintenance intervention on children's life satisfaction (primary outcome) and BMI Z-score (secondary outcome) 1 year after health camp. Methods: The extended maintenance intervention is developed by DCSH and delivered to each child and family individually by an intervention coordinator to help children maintain positive benefits of the health camp on life satisfaction and health behaviors after returning to their homes. Intervention activities target the child and the family. The effect will be tested in a quasi-experimental design: The intervention is offered to half of the children at one of the five DSCH (intervention group, N~144) while the other half and the children at the other four DSCH receive a standard maintenance intervention (control group, N~894). Children will complete questionnaires on life satisfaction measured by an adapted version of the Cantril ladder and height and weight prior to health camp, at the end of health camp, 3 months and 1 year after the end of health camp. To enable per protocol analysis and nuanced interpretation of effect estimates, we will monitor the implementation of the intervention by a process evaluation study among children, parents, and follow up coordinators using qualitative and quantitative methods. Discussion: We present a systematic approach to evaluating practice-based interventions in a research design. The study will provide new knowledge on the effectiveness of individualized maintenance interventions on long-term effects on life satisfaction and weight loss among children.

METHODS: In this subgroup analysis of a prospective study (conducted over 1 y, February 2018 through January 2019), neonates with Acinetobacter spp. sepsis were included. The data collection included demographic details, clinical features, pre-referral treatment, complications, antibiotic resistance pattern, treatment, and final outcome. RESULTS: Acinetobacter spp. accounted for 10.6% (43/406) of all isolates and 22.7% (43/189) of Gram-negative isolates. The median (IQR) age at presentation was 1 (1C2) d, 2/3rd were male, and 46.5% were preterm. All were admitted in peripheral hospitals before referral to authors centre and all received intravenous antibiotics and fluids. The resistance to different antibiotics was: Ciprofloxacin 82%, cephalosporins 78C100%, amikacin 75%, pipercillin-tazobactum 62%, carbapenems 50C85%, chloramphenicol 83%, and tetracycline 50C60%. All isolates were sensitive to colistin. The survival rate was 37.2% (n = 16) and 62.8% (n = 27) had poor outcome [death and Left against medical advice (LAMA)]. Higher proportion of neonates with Acinetobacter sepsis had septic shock, multi-organ dysfunctional syndrome (MODS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); and higher proportion required mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and had poor outcome compared to those with sepsis due to other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter spp. accounts for high burden of sepsis among out-born neonates and is associated with alarmingly high resistance to cephalosporins, fluroquinolones, aminoglycosides, pipercillin-tazobactum, tetracyclines, and carbapenems.

However, the corresponding content is often disappointing, infuriating or even deceitful. This practice has brought serious damage to our social trust, especially to online media, which is one of the most important channels for information acquisition in our daily life. Currently, clickbait is spreading on the internet and causing serious damage to society. However, research on clickbait detection has not yet been well performed. Almost all existing research treats clickbait detection as a binary classification task and only uses the title as the input. This shallow usage of information and detection technology not only suffers from low performance in real detection (e.g., it is easy to bypass) but is also difficult to use in further research (e.g., potential empirical studies). In this work, we proposed a novel clickbait detection model that incorporated a knowledge graph, a graph convolutional network and a graph attention network to conduct fine-grained-level clickbait detection. According to experiments using a real dataset, our novel proposed model outperformed classical and state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, certain explainability can also be achieved in our model through the graph attention network. Our fine-grained-level results can provide a measurement foundation for future empirical study.

The MS plays an important role in enhancing the performance of LTE/LTE-A, which is typically dependent on the received signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, using the SNR to select the proper MSs is not enough given that adaptive MSs are sensitive to error. Meanwhile, non-optimal MS selection may seriously impair the system performance and hence degrades LA. In LTE/ LTE-A, the LA system must be designed and optimized in accordance with the characteristics of the physical (e.g., MSs) and MAC layers (e.g., Packet loss) to enhance the channel efficiency and throughput. Accordingly, this study proposes using two LA models to overcome the problem. The first model, named the cross-layer link adaptation (CLLA) model, is based on the downward cross-layer approach. This model is designed to overcome the accuracy issue of adaptive modulation in existing systems and improve the channel efficiency and throughput. The second model, named the Markov decision process over the CLLA (MDP-CLLA) model, is designed to improve on the selection of modulation levels. Besides that, our previous contribution, namely the modified alpha-Shannon capacity formula, is adopted as part of the MDP-CLLA model to enhance the link adaptation of LTE/LTE-A. The effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated in terms of throughput and packet loss for different packet sizes using the MATLAB and Simulink environments for the single input single output (SISO) mode for transmissions over Rayleigh fading channels. In addition, phase productivity, which is defined as the multiplication of the total throughput for a specific modulation with the difference between adjacent modulation SNR threshold values, is used to determine the best model for specific packet sizes in addition to determine the optimal packet size for specific packet sizes among models. Results generally showed that the throughput improved from 87.5 to 89.6% for (QPSK [Formula: see text] 16-QAM) and from 0 to 43.3% for (16-QAM [Formula: see text] 64-QAM) modulation transitions, respectively, using the CLLA model when compared with the existing system. Moreover, the throughput using the MDP-CLLA model was improved by 87.5C88.6% and by 0C43.2% for the (QPSK [Formula: see text] 16-QAM)and (16-QAM [Formula: see text] 64-QAM) modulation transitions, respectively, when compared with the CLLA model and the existing system. Results were also validated for each model via the summation of the phase productivity for every modulation at specific packet sizes, followed by the application one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical analysis with a post hoc test, to prove that the MDP-CLLA model improves with best high efficiency than the CLLA model and the existing system.","output":"Efficient models for enhancing the link adaptation performance of LTE/LTE-A networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and abundance affecting the mechanical properties of the lung. This study aimed to generate ECM hydrogels from control, severe COPD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) IV], and fibrotic human lung tissue and evaluate whether their stiffness and viscoelastic properties were reflective of native tissue. For hydrogel generation, control, COPD GOLD IV, and fibrotic human lung tissues were decellularized, lyophilized, ground into powder, porcine pepsin solubilized, buffered with PBS, and gelled at 37C. Rheological properties from tissues and hydrogels were assessed with a low-load compression tester measuring the stiffness and viscoelastic properties in terms of a generalized Maxwell model representing phases of viscoelastic relaxation. The ECM hydrogels had a greater stress relaxation than tissues. ECM hydrogels required three Maxwell elements with slightly faster relaxation times () than that of native tissue, which required four elements. The relative importance (R(i)) of the first Maxwell element contributed the most in ECM hydrogels, whereas for tissue the contribution was spread over all four elements. IPF tissue had a longer-lasting fourth element with a higher R(i) than the other tissues, and IPF ECM hydrogels did require a fourth Maxwell element, in contrast to all other ECM hydrogels.

Optimal time to treatment is underexplored, so recommendations for which cancer treatments can be deferred are often based on expert opinion. Objective: To evaluate the association between increased time to definitive therapy and mortality as a function of cancer type and stage for the 4 most prevalent cancers in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed treatment and outcome information from patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and colon cancers from 2004 to 2015, with data analyzed January to March 2020. Data on outcomes associated with appropriate curative-intent surgical, radiation, or medical therapy were gathered from the National Cancer Database. Exposures: Time-to-treatment initiation (TTI), the interval between diagnosis and therapy, using intervals of 8 to 60, 61 to 120, 121 to 180, and greater than 180 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: 5-year and 10-year predicted all-cause mortality. Results: This study included 2a?241a?706 patients (mean [SD] age 63 [11.9] years, 1a?268a?794 [56.6%] women, 1a?880a?317 [83.9%] White): 1a?165a?585 (52.0%) with breast cancer, 853a?030 (38.1%) with prostate cancer, 130a?597 (5.8%) with NSCLC, and 92a?494 (4.1%) with colon cancer. Median (interquartile range) TTI by cancer was 32 (21-48) days for breast, 79 (55-117) days for prostate, 41 (27-62) days for NSCLC, and 26 (16-40) days for colon. Across all cancers, a general increase in the 5-year and 10-year predicted mortality was associated with increasing TTI. The most pronounced mortality association was for colon cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage III: TTI 61-120 d, 38.9% vs. 181-365 d, 47.8%), followed by stage I NSCLC (5 y predicted mortality: TTI 61-120 d, 47.4% vs 181-365 d, 47.6%), while survival for prostate cancer was least associated (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, high risk: TTI 61-120 d, 12.8% vs 181-365 d, 14.1%), followed by breast cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage I: TTI 61-120 d, 11.0% vs. 181-365 d, 15.2%). A nonsignificant difference in treatment delays and worsened survival was observed for stage II lung cancer patients-who had the highest all-cause mortality for any TTI regardless of treatment timing. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, for all studied cancers there was evidence that shorter TTI was associated with lower mortality, suggesting an indirect association between treatment deferral and mortality that may not become evident for years. In contrast to current pandemic-related guidelines, these findings support more timely definitive treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer.","output":"Assessment of Time-to-Treatment Initiation and Survival in a Cohort of Patients With Common Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) recognises the potential benefits and looks to harnessing telemedicine for primary health care services In this prospective self-controlled pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the safety, efficiency and user satisfaction outcomes of virtual care (VC) at a military medical centre METHODS: Out of 320 patients seen during the study period, 28 were enrolled in this study and underwent on-premises VC, comprising digital symptoms collection and telemedicine in addition to the usual in-person physician consultation Safety outcomes were measured based on the diagnostic concordance between physicians Efficiency was measured based on consultation times, and user satisfaction was evaluated using a standard questionnaire RESULTS: There was a higher caseload of both upper respiratory infections and dermatological conditions in our population, in which telemedicine performed well In terms of safety, telemedicine achieved a mean diagnostic concordance of 92 8% compared to in-person consultations In terms of efficiency, consultation times were 26 2% - or 2 minutes and 15 seconds - shorter on average with telemedicine (p = 0 0488) User satisfaction was favourable, with 85 5% of patients satisfied with the VC experience DISCUSSION: This study has been invaluable in showing that on-premises telemedicine is a safe, efficient and effective means to extend and increase our surge capacity for primary health care Our results have given us reasonable confidence to explore a larger-scale implementation in our network of military medical centres in the future","output":"Virtual care to increase military medical centre capacity in the primary health care setting: A prospective self-controlled pilot study of symptoms collection and telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Educational activities and other on-line interactions have often aimed at teaching peripheral subjects related to the science of medicine or to the treatment of illnesses and injuries.

METHODS: COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19. Participants were aged older than 30 years, and were at least 70 days post two doses of ChAd or at least 84 days post two doses of BNT primary COVID-19 immunisation course, with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18 sites were split into three groups (A, B, and C). Within each site group (A, B, or C), participants were randomly assigned to an experimental vaccine or control. Group A received NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax; hereafter referred to as NVX), a half dose of NVX, ChAd, or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) control (1:1:1:1).

Participants and all investigatory staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity and immunogenicity of anti-spike IgG measured by ELISA. The primary analysis for immunogenicity was on a modified intention-to-treat basis; safety and reactogenicity were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes included assessment of viral neutralisation and cellular responses. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 73765130. FINDINGS: Between June 1 and June 30, 2021, 3498 people were screened. 2878 participants met eligibility criteria and received COVID-19 vaccine or control.

GMRs for wild-type cellular responses compared with controls ranged from 10 (95% CI 07C16) for half VLA to 47 (31C71) for m1273. The results were similar between those aged 30C69 years and those aged 70 years and older. Fatigue and pain were the most common solicited local and systemic adverse events, experienced more in people aged 30C69 years than those aged 70 years or older. Serious adverse events were uncommon, similar in active vaccine and control groups. In total, there were 24 serious adverse events: five in the control group (two in control group A, three in control group B, and zero in control group C), two in Ad26, five in VLA, one in VLA-half, one in BNT, two in BNT-half, two in ChAd, one in CVn, two in NVX, two in NVX-half, and one in m1273. INTERPRETATION: All study vaccines boosted antibody and neutralising responses after ChAd/ChAd initial course and all except one after BNT/BNT, with no safety concerns. Substantial differences in humoral and cellular responses, and vaccine availability will influence policy choices for booster vaccination.

Previous studies have shown that BIV Rev localizes in the nucleus and nucleolus of infected cells. Here we report the characterization of the nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS) of this protein. Through transfection of a series of deletion mutants of BIV Rev fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein and fluorescence microscopy analyses, we were able to map the NLS region between aa 71 and 110 of the protein. Remarkably, by conducting alanine substitution of basic residues within the aa 71 to 110 sequence, we demonstrated that the BIV Rev NLS is bipartite, maps to aa 71 to 74 and 95 to 101, and is predominantly composed of arginine residues. This is the first report of a bipartite Rev (or Rev-like) NLS in a lentivirus/retrovirus. Moreover, this NLS is atypical, as the length of the sequence between the motifs composing the bipartite NLS, e.g., the spacer sequence, is 20 aa. Further mutagenesis experiments also identified the NoLS region of BIV Rev. It localizes mainly within the NLS spacer sequence. In addition, the BIV Rev NoLS sequence differs from the consensus sequence reported for other viral and cellular nucleolar proteins. In summary, we conclude that the nucleolar and nuclear localizations of BIV Rev are mediated via novel NLS and NoLS motifs.","output":"The bovine immunodeficiency virus rev protein: identification of a novel lentiviral bipartite nuclear localization signal harboring an atypical spacer sequence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a critical aspect of preventing the transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare settings. We aimed to identify factors related to lapses in PPE use that may influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare personnel (HCP). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center in Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 345 HCP who sustained a significant occupational exposure to a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from May 13, 2020, through November 30, 2020, were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 8 HCP (2.3%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection during their 14-day postexposure quarantine. A lack of eye protection during the care of a patient with COVID-19 was associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the postexposure quarantine (relative risk [RR], 10.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-82.39; P = .009). Overall, the most common reason for a significant exposure was the use of a surgical face mask instead of a respirator during an aerosol-generating procedure (55.9%). However, this was not associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the postexposure quarantine (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1; P = 1). Notably, transmission primarily occurred in units that did not regularly care for patients with COVID-19.

A sudden shift from face-to-face and blended settings to a completely online delivery mode has introduced changes to conventional teaching methods, and made learning rely heavily on technology and the Internet. Hence, students' online engagement with these tools has become even more important for their academic success. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the effects of various indicators of students' online presence on their academic performance. This paper explores the effectiveness of online presence in Higher Education Institutes, where COVID-19 has shifted the deliveries to online mode. The chosen indicator is frequency that will be adequately used to quantify the effectiveness of online presence on student performance in online mathematics courses. Statistical methods are used to measure the correlation and association between students' online presence indicators and their performance. As such, it would allow to build models to predict future outcomes or occurrences and student performances, with a major focus on mathematics and statistics courses.

Managing these cases posed a great challenge to the treating clinicians in the absence of targeted therapy. At this juncture, few modalities got approved as EUA (Emergency use under authorization) drugs namely Remdesivir, Convalescent Plasma (CP), and Tocilizumab (TCZ) to treat this deadly disease. AIM: To analyze the success rates of EUA therapies for Covid-19 pneumonia in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted from April 2020 to October 2020 in the department of Medicine at Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. All adults with moderate to severe Covid-19 as per the WHO criteria were enrolled in the study with their informed consent. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min, deranged liver function tests, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and deranged hematological parameters were excluded from the study. Thorough clinical evaluation was done in all cases. Routine investigations together with CRP, LDH, serum Ferritin, D Dimer and IL6, Chest X-Ray, and HRCT thorax were done in all cases. ECG was done in all cases and 2D-ECHO in selected ones. Depending on their clinical and radiological criteria, patients were treated with various modalities approved under EUA with close monitoring of clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters. Presenting symptoms, clinical findings, co-morbidities, laboratory parameters, and radiological assessment were analyzed, and statistical analysis was done. The survival rate and in-hospital mortality was analyzed. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: We had a total of 448 patients who were included in our study, out of which 326 were males and 122 were females with a male to female ratio of 2.7:1. Their age varied between 16 and 91 years with an average age of 51.4 years with a standard deviation (SD) of +/- 6.4 years. About 255 patients (57%) received only Remdesivir (176 males, 79 females), 139 (105 males, 35 females) patients (31%) received Remdesivir along with two units of CP, and 38 (32 males, 6 females) patients received a combination of Remdesivir, CP, and TCZ. All patients in our study tolerated the drugs well. About 5% of cases who received CP had minor transfusion reactions. One patient had TRALI and three patients had TACO, which was managed aggressively. Asymptomatic transaminitis was seen in 36% patients. The survival rate in patients treated with Remdesivir was 78%, those with Remdesivir and CP was 44%, and those with all three was 13%. The mean length of stay was 14.23 days with a SD of 9.06 days in patients treated with TCZ in comparison to other two modalities, which was 13.88 days with a standard variation of +/- 8.71 days in Remdesivir and 13.88 days with a SD of 8.73 days in patients treated with CP that was stastically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Though the success rate of various drugs under EUA varies in different studies from all over the world, the data to support their use are encouraging. We also observed satisfying results in our study specially with the use of Remdesivir. Therefore, EUA agents should be used early to fight against COVID-19 along with the other measures as per the protocol laid by ICMR and MoHFW.","output":"Success rate of Remdesivir, Convalescent Plasma, and Tocilizumab in moderate to severe Covid-19 pneumonia: our experience in a tertiary care center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND While laparoscopy is now the standard for cholecystectomy, recent papers have focused on single-incision approaches. Intraoperative cholangiography remains an integral part of laparoscopic cholecystectomy but has not yet been well described within the single-access literature. We discuss our method of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with routine intraoperative cholangiograms. METHODS A retrospective review of our surgical database was completed. One hundred twenty-three patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified (83 standard laparoscopy, 40 single-incision laparoscopy). Patient demographics including age and body mass index (BMI), and indications for surgery, operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, and ability to complete cholangiography were analyzed. RESULTS All patients with standard laparoscopy had successful cholangiograms. Two patients did not undergo cholangiography based on a preoperative decision (pregnancy). In the 40 patients who underwent single-incision cholecystectomy, 38 cholangiograms were completed (95%). One patient with acute cholecystitis had a small cystic duct which could not be cannulated. The second had a cystic duct through which the cholangiocatheter could not be advanced. Comparative analysis of patient demographics showed a significant difference in patient age between the two groups, as well as a significantly greater number of patients undergoing single-incision cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis as opposed to acute cholecystitis. DISCUSSION Completion of intraoperative cholangiography is an important aspect of cholecystectomy in order to identify choledocholithiasis and verify anatomy. With the advent of single-access laparoscopy, standard operative principles should not be compromised. Cholangiography may provide a safer approach to cholecystectomy when adopting a new technique. We present our technique of single-incision cholecystectomy and routine cholangiography with a 95% success rate. The ability to perform single-incision intraoperative cholangiograms will allow a safe, more minimally invasive approach to cholecystectomy with suspected choledocholithiasis and obviate the need to convert to standard multiport laparoscopy for the sole reason of completing cholangiograms.","output":"Single-access laparoscopic cholecystectomy with routine intraoperative cholangiogram."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population growth, even if coupled to economic growth, and resources, were already on a collision course, especially in Africa. The 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report provided a dramatic status of world water, however without questioning the main drivers of an imminent water crisis, that were unbounded, unequal, economic, and population growth, within the context of reducing resources in a finite world. Despite the report was a small step forward in awareness, still, it was not proposing satisfactory remedies. With business-as-usual, without acting on the drivers of water scarcity, regional water crises were inevitable in the next 3 decades, starting from Africa. Constrained by political, financial, and energy burdens, the technological improvements that have helped humanity to deal with the increased demand for water, food, and energy over the last 70 years, were likely not enough to avoid the water crisis.

Despite this increased risk and the available guidelines1, we reported a sub-optimal vaccination rate of 27.4% of IMID patients in 2018. In the meantime, a vaccination module was introduced in the electronic patient health record of our hospital to accurately document and monitor vaccination status of patients. The impact of this new module on vaccination coverage was re-evaluated in the same IMID patients in 2021. Methods: Between Aug and Oct 2021, the vaccination status of 1448 (out of the original 1488) IMID patients (44.8% male, median age 53.6 years) was collected (798 patients with IBD, 612 with rheumatological, and 38 with dermatological inflammatory conditions) and compared to that of 2018. The vaccination status was obtained mainly through the patients' electronic medical records. Missing data were added after contacting patients or their general practitioner. Results: From 2018 to 2021, the overall vaccination coverage of all IMID patients significantly increased from 27.4% to 51.9% (p<0.001, Figure 1). The vaccination coverage in IBD patients increased significantly from 75.9% to 86.3% for influenza (p<0.001), from 72.9% to 88.7% for pneumococci (p<0.001), from 66.0% to 80.2% for hepatitis B (p<0.001), from 79.9% to 85.7% for tetanus (p=0.041) and from 42.2% to 60.4% overall (p<0.001) (Figure 1 and Table 1). Similarly, the vaccination coverage significantly increased for rheumatology patients, namely from 69.3% to 78.3% for influenza (p<0.001), from 34.5% to 85.0% for pneumococci (p<0.001), from 32.8% to 36.5% for hepatitis B (p<0.001) and from 7.8% to 32.6% overall (p<0.001) (Figure 1 and Table 1). Conclusion: The suboptimal vaccination rate measured in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic stressed the importance of vaccination recommendations to patients and healthcare professionals.

We also analyzed the robustness of the networks, identified the most critical airports per integrator, and assessed that the network of DHL is the most robust according to our definition of robustness. Finally, given the unprecedented historical time that the airline industry is facing at the moment of writing, we provided some insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the global capacity of integrators and other cargo airlines. Our results suggest that full-cargo airlines and, much more dramatically, combination airlines were impacted by the pandemic. On the other hand, apart from fluctuations in offered capacity due to travel bans that were quickly recovered thanks to the resilience of their networks, integrators seem to have escaped the early months of the pandemic unscathed.","output":"Integrators' global networks: A topology analysis with insights into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As governments around the world decide to deploy digital health passports as a tool to curb the spread of Covid-19, it becomes increasingly important to consider how these can be constructed with privacy-by-design.

METHODS Data for census metropolitan areas were obtained from the Canadian Mortality Database and population censuses for the years 1971, 1986, 1991 and 1996. Deaths amenable to medical care, amenable to public health, from ischaemic heart disease and from other causes were considered. Data on deaths were grouped into neighbourhood income quintiles on the basis of the census tract percentage of population below Canada's low-income cut-offs. RESULTS From 1971 to 1996, differences between the richest and poorest quintiles in age-standardised expected years of life lost amenable to medical care decreased 60% (p<0.001) in men and 78% (p<0.001) in women, those amenable to public health increased 0.7% (p = 0.94) in men and 20% (p = 0.55) in women, those lost from ischaemic heart disease decreased 58% in men and 38% in women, and from other causes decreased 15% in men and 9% in women. Changes in the age-standardised expected years of life lost difference for deaths amenable to medical care were significantly larger than those for deaths amenable to public health or other causes for both men and women (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Reductions in rates of deaths amenable to medical care made the largest contribution to narrowing socioeconomic mortality disparities.

Suction was performed on an adult training lung, ventilated with either volume-controlled (VC-CMV) or pressure-controlled mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV), using ETT sizes of 6.5C8.0 mm paired with suction catheter sizes of 8C14 French (Fr). Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) increased by 50% when the ETTs ventilation area was less than 25 mm2 in size, especially in patients with high airway resistance ventilated with VC-CMV. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels significantly decreased when using 14 Fr SC during VC-CMV and fewer effects during PC-CMV. Change of expiratory minute volume increased with higher outer diameter of suction catheters and decreased with severe lung compliance during PC-CMV.

Data include age, sex, operative time, blood loss, length of stay, and complications according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification. Hasson technique was used for peritoneal entry, GelPOINT advanced access platform was inserted, and standard 5mm laparoscopic instruments were used. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients (median age 5 years, 4 months-17 years) met inclusion criteria: 29 nephrectomies, 9 nephroureterectomies, 3 bilateral nephrectomies, 5 heminephrectomies, 5 renal cyst decortications, 3 bilateral gonadectomies, 2 Malone antegrade continence enema, 2 calyceal diverticulectomy, and 1 ovarian detorsion with cystectomy. Median operative times for each case type were comparable to published experiences with traditional laparoscopy. Overall mean and median length of stay was 36.2 hours and 1 day, respectively. There were two complications: port site hernia requiring surgical repair (Clavien IIIb) and a superficial port site infection that resolved with antibiotics (Clavien II). Cosmetic outcomes were subjectively well received by patients and their parents. Operative time was significantly shorter between the first half of the experience and the second half (102 vs 70 minutes, P < .05).

The ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates several well-defined cellular mechanisms of ethanol stress response (ESR); however, the involved regulatory control remains to be characterized. Here, we report a new transcription factor of ethanol stress adaptation called Znf1. It plays a central role in ESR by activating genes for glycerol and fatty acid production (GUP1, GPP1, GPP2, GPD1, GAT1, and OLE1) to preserve plasma membrane integrity. Importantly, Znf1 also activates genes implicated in cell wall biosynthesis (FKS1, SED1, and SMI1) and in the unfolded protein response (HSP30, HSP104, KAR1, and LHS1) to protect cells from proteotoxic stress. The znf1 strain displays increased sensitivity to ethanol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor -mercaptoethanol, and the cell wall-perturbing agent calcofluor white. To compensate for a defective cell wall, the strain lacking ZNF1 or its target SMI1 displays increased glycerol levels of 19.6% and 27.7%, respectively. Znf1 collectively regulates an intricate network of target genes essential for growth, protein refolding, and production of key metabolites. Overexpression of ZNF1 not only confers tolerance to high ethanol levels but also increases ethanol production by 4.6% (8.43 g/liter) or 2.8% (75.78 g/liter) when 2% or 20% (wt/vol) glucose, respectively, is used as a substrate, compared to that of the wild-type strain. The mutually stress-responsive transcription factors Msn2/4, Hsf1, and Yap1 are associated with some promoters of Znf1s target genes to promote ethanol stress tolerance. In conclusion, this work implicates the novel regulator Znf1 in coordinating expression of ESR genes and illuminates the unifying transcriptional reprogramming during alcoholic fermentation. IMPORTANCE The yeast S. cerevisiae is a major microbe that is widely used in food and nonfood industries. However, accumulation of ethanol has a negative effect on its growth and limits ethanol production. The Znf1 transcription factor has been implicated as a key regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the utilization of different carbon sources, including glucose, the most abundant sugar on earth, and nonfermentable substrates. Here, the role of Znf1 in ethanol stress response is defined. Znf1 actively reprograms expression of genes linked to the unfolded protein response (UPR), heat shock response, glycerol and carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthesis of cell membrane and cell wall components. A complex interplay among transcription factors of ESR indicates transcriptional fine-tuning as the main mechanism of stress adaptation, and Znf1 plays a major regulatory role in the coordination. Understanding the adaptive ethanol stress mechanism is crucial to engineering robust yeast strains for enhanced stress tolerance or increased ethanol production.","output":"Reprogramming of the Ethanol Stress Response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the Transcription Factor Znf1 and Its Effect on the Biosynthesis of Glycerol and Ethanol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 has become the urgent need to control the spread of the epidemic. In clinical settings, lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images can provide vital information for the quantification and diagnosis of COVID-19. However, accurate infection segmentation is a challenging task due to (i) the low boundary contrast between infections and the surroundings, (ii) large variations of infection regions, and, most importantly, (iii) the shortage of large-scale annotated data. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage cross-domain transfer learning framework for accurately segmenting COVID-19 lung infections from CT images. Our framework consists of two major technical innovations, including an effective infection segmentation deep learning model, called nCoVSegNet, and a novel two-stage transfer learning strategy. Specifically, our nCoVSegNet conducts effective infection segmentation by taking advantage of attention-aware feature fusion and large receptive fields, aiming to resolve the issues related to low boundary contrast and large infection variations. To alleviate the shortage of the data, the nCoVSegNet is pre-trained using a two-stage cross-domain transfer learning strategy, which makes full use of the knowledge from natural images (i.e., ImageNet) and medical images (i.e., LIDC-IDRI) to boost the final training on CT images with COVID-19 infections.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-validated, structured, self-administered, electronic survey with 35 closed multiple choice questions was conducted in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and English and Deutsch versions from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. The survey was distributed through social networks and the official American Confederation of Urology (CAU) website. It was anonymous, mainly addressed to Latin American urologists and urology residents. It included 35 questions exploring different aspects: 1) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and internal management protocols for healthcare providers; 2) Priority surgeries and urological urgencies and 3) Inpatient and outpatient care. RESULTS: Of 864 surveys received, 846 had at least 70% valid responses and were included in the statistical analyses. Surveys corresponded to South America in 62% of the cases, Central America and North America in 29.7%. 12.7% were residents. Regarding to PPE and internal management protocols, 88% confirmed the implementation of specific protocols and 45.4% have not received training to perform a safe clinical practice; only 2.3% reported being infected with COVID-19. 60.9% attended urgent surgeries. The following major uro-oncologic surgeries were reported as high priority: Radical Nephrectomy (RN) 58.4%, and Radical Cystectomy (RC) 57.3%. When we associate the capacity of hospitalization (urologic beds available) and percentage of high-priority surgery performed, we observed that centers with fewer urological beds (10-20) compared to centers with more urological beds (31-40) performed more frequently major urologic cancer surgeries: RN 54.5% vs 60.8% (p=0.0003), RC 53.1% vs 64.9% (p=0.005) respectively.

The presidential declaration and subsequent lockdown came at a time when some of the universities in South Africa were already struggling either to commence the academic year, or to make up for time lost due to persistent student protests relating to several student demands. However, disaster management now entailed that all schools and institutions of higher education were forced to close immediately for extended periods, necessitating alternative ways of ensuring access to education.

A second aim was an examination of the challenges experienced by the two institutions' largely rural student population. The authors collected data using a questionnaire completed by 15 educators and 30 students from the two universities. They also analysed official communications documents from the universities addressed to lecturers and students. The results indicate that access to online teaching and learning platforms and resources for students from poor rural communities in South Africa is challenging, and that there are gross inequalities in educational outcomes for learners from different socio-economic backgrounds.

Methods: A systematic review (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021261948) was conducted up until July 2021 using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, with articles screened in duplicate. Gray literature searches were also conducted (June-July 2021), and reference lists of two relevant review articles were screened. Included articles provided the complete methods for a framework that has been used to evaluate scientific validity in nutrition and/or genetics. Articles were excluded if they provided a framework for evaluating health services/systems more broadly. Citing articles of the included articles were then screened in Google Scholar to determine if the framework had been used in nutrition or genetics, or both; frameworks that had not were excluded. Summary tables were piloted in duplicate and revised accordingly prior to synthesizing all included articles. Frameworks were critically appraised for their applicability to nutrigenetic scientific validity assessment using a predetermined categorization matrix, which included key factors deemed important by an expert panel for assessing scientific validity in nutrigenetics. Results: Upon screening 3,931 articles, a total of 49 articles representing 41 total frameworks, were included in the final analysis (19 used in genetics, 9 used in nutrition, and 13 used in both). Factors deemed important for evaluating nutrigenetic evidence related to study design and quality, generalizability, directness, consistency, precision, confounding, effect size, biological plausibility, publication/funding bias, allele and nutrient dose-response, and summary levels of evidence. Frameworks varied in the components of their scientific validity assessment, with most assessing study quality. Consideration of biological plausibility was more common in frameworks used in genetics. Dose-response effects were rarely considered. Two included frameworks incorporated all but one predetermined key factor important for nutrigenetic scientific validity assessment.

We found that the use of host cell biomass for virus production was highest for archaea at 10%, followed by bacteria at 1% and eukarya at 0.01%, highlighting the degree to which viruses of archaea and bacteria exploit their host cells. For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells.

At the beginning (T0), after 14 days (T1) and after 28 days (T2) of supplementation, general fatigue, mental fatigue and Quality of Life indexes were evaluated through specific questionnaires. The assessment of quality of life and health status were measured through the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire, chronic fatigue using the FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire and mental fatigue using the modified Chalder questionnaire. Results 201 subjects were enrolled for the study; results showed a significant improvement in all indexes analyzed after 14 and 28 days of supplementation. The main significant improvement was observed after the first 14 days and it was further confirmed at 28 days as well. The RTE (Relative Treatment Effect) trend about quality of life, health status, FACIT-Fatigue and mental fatigue in the three questionnaires was statistically significant (Wald Statistic, p <0.0001). The data of FACIT-questionnaire showed an improvement of at least 1 unit in 76.62% of subjects after 14 days and in 90.05% of subjects after 28 days. An improvement of 10-unit was found in about one third of subjects after 14 days and in half of the subjects after 28 days. Conclusions This study shows that Apportal can reduce chronic fatigue and improve quality of life and health status in subjects after SARS-CoV-2 negativity due to the synergistic effect of its components.","output":"Observational study on the benefit of a nutritional supplement, supporting immune function and energy metabolism, on chronic fatigue associated with the SARS-CoV-2 post-infection progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of March 2020, the time when the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic, our existence has been threatened and the lives of millions have been claimed. With this ongoing global issue, vaccines are considered of paramount importance in curtailing the outbreak and probably a prime gamble to bring us back to ordinary life. To date, more than 200 vaccine candidates have been produced, many of which were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use, with the research and discovery phase of their production process passed over. Capering such a chief practice in COVID-19 vaccine development, and manufacturing vaccines at an unprecedented speed brought many challenges into play and raised COVID-19 vaccine remonstrance. In this review, we highlight relevant challenges to global COVID-19 vaccine development, dissemination, and deployment, particularly at the level of large-scale production and distribution.

This multicentre, randomised, controlled study included patients 18-44 years of age with low-risk term, singleton pregnancies. The randomisation was done weekly. Scheduled caesarean deliveries without labour were included. For comparison, the Additional treatment, Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, Separation of deep tissues, Isolation of bacteria, Stay in hospital > 14 days (ASEPSIS) score for wound healing assessment was modified. The absolute scores were obtained based on a one-day reading rather than the five-day reading used in ASEPSIS. Zero (\\"0\\") was assigned as a complete healing. Higher scores were associated with more severe disruption of healing. The patients were enrolled between March 2015 and February 2017. The demographics were not statistically different. The wound scoring was similar in the groups at discharge and first-week evaluation. At the six weeks post-surgery, the wound scoring was significantly less in the 48-hour (3.9%) versus the 24-hour group (9%; p = .002). Dressing removal at 48 hours had a lower scoring in the low-risk population with scheduled caesarean deliveries.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Surgical dressings are used to provide suitable conditions to heal caesarean incisions. There has been a limited number of studies on the evaluation of ideal timing on wound dressing removal after a caesarean delivery. These studies concluded there are no increased wound complications with removal at six hours versus 24 hours or within or beyond 48 hours after surgery.What do the results of this study add? The postoperative removal of the wound dressing at 48 hours had a lower wound score at six weeks than the removal at 24 hours for women with uncomplicated scheduled caesarean deliveries.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Early discharge after caesarean delivery is becoming more common. Dressing removal at 24 hours versus 48 hours becomes more crucial and needs to be clarified. Besides, high-risk populations, different skin closure techniques, and patients in labour should be addressed separately.","output":"Impact of timing on wound dressing removal after caesarean delivery: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Analysis of health inequalities by ethnicity is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In Ecuador, similar to other Latin American countries, indigenous and afro-descendant populations have long been subject to racism, discrimination, and inequitable treatment. Although in recent years, Ecuador has made progress in health indicators, particularly those related to the coverage of Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (RMNCH) interventions, little is known as to whether inequalities by ethnicity persist. METHODS: Analysis was based on two nationally representative health surveys (2004 and 2012). Ethnicity was self-reported and classified into three categories (Indigenous/Afro-Ecuadorian/Mixed ancestry). Coverage data for six RMNCH health interventions were stratified for each ethnic group by level of education, area of residence and wealth quintiles. Absolute inequality measures were computed and multivariate analysis using Poisson regression was undertaken. FINDINGS: In 2012, 74.4% of women self-identifying as indigenous did not achieve the secondary level of education and 50.7% were in the poorest quintile (Q1); this profile was relatively unchanged since 2004. From 2004 to 2012, the coverage of RMNCH interventions increased for all ethnic groups, and absolute inequality decreased. However, in 2012, regardless of education level, area of residence and wealth quintiles, ethnic inequalities remained for almost all RMNCH interventions. Indigenous women had 24% lower prevalence of modern contraceptive use (Prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.76; 95% IC: 0.7C0.8); 28% lower prevalence of antenatal care (PR = 0.72; 95% IC: 0.6C0.8); and 35% lower prevalence of skilled birth attendance and institutional delivery (PR = 0.65; 95% IC: 0.6C0.7 and PR = 0.65; 95% IC: 0.6C0.7 respectively), compared with the majority ethnic group in the country. INTERPRETATION: While the gaps have narrowed, indigenous people in Ecuador continue in a situation of structural racism and are left behind in terms of access to RMNCH interventions. Strategies to reduce ethnic inequalities in the coverage services need to be collaboratively redesigned/co-designed.

Although these receptors also respond to synthetic small chemical ligands, such as CL075 and R848, it remains to be determined whether these receptors sense natural small molecules or not. In the structure of human TLR8 (huTLR8) with ssRNA, there are two ligand-binding sites: one binds a uridine and the other binds an oligoribonucleotide (ORN). This finding demonstrates that huTLR8 recognizes degradation products of ssRNA, suggesting the presence of natural small ligands. We here show that TLR7 works as the sensor for guanosine (G)/2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) in the presence of ORN where ORN strengthens TLR7 interaction with G/dG. In addition, modified nucleosides such as 7-methylguanosine, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) activated TLR7 with ORNs. Importantly, 8-OHdG-a well-known oxidative DNA damage marker with unknown function-induced strong cytokine production comparable to G and dG both in mouse and human immune cells. Although 8-OHdG bound TLR7/ORN with lower affinity than dG did in isothermal titration calorimetry, administered 8-OHdG was metabolically more stable than dG in the serum, indicating that 8-OHdG acts on TLR7 as an endogenous ligand in vivo To address a role of G analogs in the disease state, we also examined macrophages from Unc93b1 (D34A/D34A) mice, which suffer from TLR7-dependent systemic inflammation, and found that Unc93b1 (D34A/D34A) macrophages showed significantly enhanced response to G alone or 8-OHdG with ORN. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that G, dG, 8-OHG and 8-OHdG are novel endogenous ligands for TLR7.","output":"Guanosine and its modified derivatives are endogenous ligands for TLR7."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hurricane season brings new and complex challenges as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted nearly twice the normal number of tropical storms and hurricanes this season, while projections of COVID-19 models continue to rise in the United States as the Atlantic hurricane season progresses. Our research examines the critical intersection of hurricane response and public health in Harris County, Texas. We examine a hypothetical case of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey occurring amid the current pandemic. This research uses point of interest visitations as location intelligence data provided by SafeGraph together with Social Vulnerability Index and historical flood data to examine the critical intersection of natural hazard planning and response and the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the risks of a compound hazard situation. COVID-19 transmission hotspots and businesses in a community due to storm preparation activity were identified. The main drivers of transmission risk arise from overall pandemic exposure and increased interpersonal contact during hurricane preparation. Residents of health-risk areas will need to make logistical arrangements to visit alternative medical facilities for treatments related to either COVID-19 or physical impacts, such as injuries, due to the hurricane risks. Points of interest needed for disaster preparation are more likely to be situated in high-risk areas, therefore making cross-community spread more likely. Moreover, greater susceptibility could arise from social vulnerability (socioeconomic status and demographic factors) and disrupted access to healthcare facilities. Results from this study can be used to identify high-risk areas for COVID-19 transmission for prioritization in planning for temporary healthcare centers and other essential services in low-risk areas. Understanding the interplay between disaster preparation and the restrictive environment laid out by the pandemic is critical for community leaders and public health officials for ensuring the population has sufficient access to essential infrastructure services.

BLSOM can separate clades defined by GISAID with high precision, and each clade is subdivided into clusters, which shows a differential increase/decrease pattern based on geographic region and time. This allowed us to identify prevalent strains in each region and to show the commonality and diversity of the prevalent strains.

Prior pre-clinical biomedical technologic advances in nucleic acid-based vaccination enabled unprecedented speed of conceptualization, development, production, and widespread distribution of mRNA vaccines that target SARS-CoV-2s Spike (S) protein. DESIGN: Twenty-five female and male volunteer fulltime employees at the Providence VA Medical Center participated in this study to examine longitudinal antibody responses to the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. IgM-S and IgG-S were measured in serum using the Abbott IgM-S-Qualitative and IgG2-S-Quantitative chemiluminescent assays. RESULTS: Peak IgM responses after Vaccine Dose #1 were delayed in 6 (24%) and absent in 7 (28%) participants. IgG2-S peak responses primarily occurred 40 to 44 days after Vaccine Dose #1, which was also 11 to 14 days after Vaccine Dose #2. However, subgroups exhibited Strong (n = 6; 24%), Normal (n = 13; 52%), or Weak (n = 6; 24%) peak level responses that differed significantly from each other (P < .005 or better). The post-peak IgG2-S levels declined progressively, and within 6 months reached the mean level measured 1 month after Vaccine Dose #1. Weak responders exhibited persistently low levels of IgG2-S. Variability in vaccine responsiveness was unrelated to age or gender. CONCLUSION: Host responses to SARS-CoV-2-Spike mRNA vaccines vary in magnitude, duration and occurrence. This study raises concern about the lack of vaccine protection in as many as 8% of otherwise normal people, and the need for open dialog about future re-boosting requirements to ensure long-lasting immunity via mRNA vaccination versus natural infection.","output":"Heterogeneous Longitudinal Antibody Responses to Covid-19 mRNA Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Humor and sarcasm may be used as potential coping strategies during challenging times, and to improve wellbeing. We investigated changes in humor and sarcasm use during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants with varying anxiety and depression symptom severity, and in those with versus without psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Online data was collected from N = 661 Canadian adults during the height of COVID-19-related restrictions. Depression and anxiety symptom severity were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Participants were queried on current presence/absence of a psychiatric disorder, and on changes in humor and sarcasm use during compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: Participants with any vs. no depression symptoms reported more sarcasm and humor use during the pandemic. Respondents with mild and severe vs. no anxiety symptoms reported using more sarcasm. However, those with any vs. no anxiety symptoms used less humor during the pandemic. Finally, less humor use was noted in those without vs. with a psychiatric disorder. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures and a sample that may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with depression symptoms used more humor and sarcasm as a potential coping strategy during COVID-19. While individuals with anxiety symptoms used more sarcasm, this was not true of humor, suggesting their decreased reliance on levity during a crisis. Humor use was greater in those with psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to self-preservation mechanisms during times of distress.

METHODS: Analysis was performed on datasets from Italy, Iran, and Brazil. TA indicators tested were: (1) the combined use of a faster (3-d) and a slower (20-d) simple moving averages (SMA), (2) the moving average converge/divergence (MACD), and (3) the divergence in the direction of the number of new daily cases trend and the corresponding MACD histogram. RESULTS: We found that the use of both fast/slow SMAs and MACD provided a reliable signal of trend inversion of SARS-Cov-2 spread. Results were consistent for all the 3 countries considered. The trend reversals signaled by the indicators were always followed by a sustained trend persistence until a new signal of reversal appeared.

In this study, the COVID-19 connection with various weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity is investigated and the future scenario of COVID-19 is predicted based on the Gaussian model (GM). This study is conducted in Delhi, the capital city of India, during the lowest mobility rate due to strict lockdown nationwide for about two months from March 15 to May 17, 2020. Spearman correlation is applied to obtain the interconnection of COVID-19 cases with weather parameters. Based on statistical analysis, this has been observed that the temperature parameter shows a significant positive trend during the period of study. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is fitted with respect to the number of days by using the Gaussian curve and it is estimated on the basis of the model that maximum cases will go up to 123,886 in number. The maximum number of cases will be observed during the range of 166  36 days. It is also estimated by using the width of the fitted GM that it will take minimum of 10 months for the complete recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, the linear regression technique is used to find the trend of COVID-19 cases with temperature and it is estimated that with an increase in temperature by 1 C, 30 new COVID-19 cases on daily basis will be expected to observe.

Coagulation dysfunction is a key pathogenetic element of this disease as well as a challenge for practitioners. Marked inflammatory process found in severe forms of COVID-19, the complement activation, the cytokine storm, and disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in the onset of thrombotic microangiopathy and large vessel coagulopathy. Virus-induced procoagulant activity occurs at the systemic level. Intravascular microthrombi disrupt vascularization in various tissues and organs, contributing to the occurrence of multiorgan failure and explain the higher morbidity and all-cause mortality of patients. It is estimated that almost 20% of patients with COVID-19 have significant coagulation disorders, and about a quarter of those hospitalized in intensive care units are prone to develop thrombosis events under prophylactic anticoagulant treatment. Some of patients who have been immunized after healing from the SARS-CoV-2 infection have a hypercoagulable state and are prone to develop thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is supported by thrombelastographic analysis: patients have an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation and higher clot strength. Markers of coagulation dysfunction in SARS-CoV2 are: decreased platelet count, increased INR, presence of fibrin degradation products, and especially higher plasma levels of D-dimers, which predict unfavorable outcome in these patients.

We sought to characterize heterogeneity in postoperative pain experiences. METHODS: We enrolled patients undergoing a cardiac surgery at a tertiary care center between January 2019 and February 2020. Participants received an electronically-delivered questionnaire every 3 days for 30 days to assess incision site pain level. We evaluated the variability in pain trajectories over 30 days by the cohort-level mean with confidence band and latent classes identified by group-based trajectory model. Group-based trajectory model estimated the probability of belonging to a specific trajectory of pain. RESULTS: Of 92 patients enrolled, 75 provided 3 questionnaire responses. The cohort-level mean showed a gradual and consistent decline in the mean pain level, but the confidence bands covered most of the pain score range. The individual-level trajectories varied substantially across patients. Group-based trajectory model identified 4 pain trajectories: persistently low (n=9, 12%), moderate declining (initially mid-level, followed by decline; n=26, 35%), high declining (initially high-level, followed by decline; n=33, 44%), and persistently high pain (n=7, 9%). Persistently high pain and high declining groups did not seem to be clearly distinguishable until approximately postoperative day 10. Patients in persistently low pain trajectory class had a numerically lower median age than the other 3 classes and were below the lower confidence band of the cohort-level approach. Patients in the persistently high pain trajectory class had a longer median length of hospital stay than the other 3 classes and were often higher than the upper confidence band of the cohort-level approach. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 4 trajectories of postoperative pain that were not evident from a cohort-level mean, which has been a common way of reporting pain level.

METHOD: This paper uses conceptual and normative analysis to address responsibility in the context of the pandemic. The paper also refers to reports published by the German Ethics Council, the Malaysian Bioethics Community and the Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics. RESULTS: The primary responsibility of governments is to create a balance between individual values and rights, one hand, and the health of the population, on the other. There are good reasons to conceive of individual responsibility as a virtue, having to do with the development of crucial character traits and habits. The responsibility of governments is connected to individual responsibility through the values of trust and solidarity.

Pregnant women with GDM are considered risk patients for a severe course of COVID-19. In the context of the COVID-19-pandemic and with a focus on women with GDM, there are serious concerns regarding adverse effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Effective treatments for GDM patients are therefore particularly important. Due to the contact restrictions and infection risks, digital approaches such as telemedicine are suitable. Against this background, it is important to focus on pregnant women with GDM in more detail in the context of COVID-19 and with a view to telemedical treatment options. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimes to summarize currently available evidence on maternal and offspring outcomes of pregnant women with GDM and COVID-19 (1) and to examine telemedical interventions to improve maternal glycemic control during COVID-19-pandemic (2). METHODS: Publications were systematically identified by searching the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE, and CINAHL for studies published until March 2021. We sorted the COVID-19 studies (1) by outcomes and divided the telemedical intervention studies (2) into two groups: web-based and app-based. We analyzised case reports (COVID-19 studies) and randomized as well as non-randomized controlled clinical trials (telemedicine studies). For determining the change in HbA1c, we pooled appropriate studies and calculated the difference in means, with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the intervention and control group at the end of the interventions. RESULTS: Regarding COVID-19 studies, we identified n=11 case reports, n=3 letter, n=1 case series and n=1 retrospective single center study. In total, n=41 patients with GDM and COVID-19 were analyzed. The maternal and neonatal outcomes were extremely heterogeneous. We identified adverse outcomes for mother and child through the interaction of GDM and COVID-19 such as cesarean sections, admission to (neonatal) intensive care unit, ventilation, and low Apgar scores. Furthermore, we selected n=9 telemedicine-related articles: n=6 were RCTs, n=2 CCTs and n=1 quasi-experimental design. In total, we analyzed n=480 GDM patients in the intervention and n=494 in the control groups. Of the n=9 telemedical studies, 4 were rated as strong, 4 were rated as moderate and 1 as weak quality studies. Telemedical interventions, in particular web-based and app-based treatments, can contribute to favourable impacts on HbA1c and FBG values in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aMeta-analysis revealed a an effect size of mean difference in HbA1c of -0.19 % (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.03) for all telemedical interventions, MD = -0.138 % (95% CI: -0.,24 to -0.,04) for web-based interventions and MD = -0.305 % (96% CI: -0.,88 to 0.,27) for app-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is an effective approach in the context of COVID-19 and GDM, as it provides social distancing and represents an optimal care of GDM patients, especially with regard to glycemic control, which is very important in view of the identified adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

However, research has seldom assessed the influence of pig slurry properties on the fate of veterinary medicines even though such an understanding is essential for a more robust environmental risk assessment. Changes within manure degradation rates have the potential to alter the concentration of antibiotics applied to land, and the outcome of the risk assessment. The aim of this work was to investigate whether commonly reported redox potentials affect the degradation rates of acetyl-salicylic acid, ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and tylosin. The employed redox potentials were -100 mV (reduced), -250a?mV (anaerobic) and -400 mV (very anaerobic). A compound specific relationship was observed where the degradation of ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was inhibited under reduced conditions over that of very anaerobic; the respective DT50 values were 0.7-1.84a?h, 1.35-3.61a?h, 22.2-49.8a?h, 131-211a?h and 35.4-94a?h. In contrast, tylosin was found to degrade faster at reduced conditions over very anaerobic (DT50 6.88-19.4a?h). The presented research demonstrates the importance of redox potential on degradation rates and suggests we need stringent and harmonized redox control to improve the environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicines.

The disadvantages include increased cost, slower graft embodiment, and the risk of viral or bacterial infection, which may occur either by transmission from an infected donor or by contamination by the healthcare provider. Careful donor selection, aseptic graft procurement and processing, and tissue sterilization, by irradiation or proprietary chemical processing, are the three major steps of the graft preparation procedure. Successful allograft implantation depends on sterility, reduction of antigenicity, and preservation of the biomechanical properties of the graft. To date, reports on the clinical and functional outcomes of allograft compared to autograft ACL reconstruction are controversial.

The present study aims to investigate the effects of 6-week swimming training on blood pressure, oxidative stress variables of selected tissues, serum adrenomedullin (ADM) levels, and in situ muscle contraction in rats with hypertension induced by N&#969;-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOs). Materials and Methods: Twenty-six male Sprague Dawley, 8 weeks of age, rats were randomly divided into four groups: (I) normotensive (C), (II) normotensive + exercise (E), (III) hypertensive (L), and (IV) hypertensive + exercise (LE). Hypertension was induced by the oral administration of L-NAME (60 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Exercise was performed 5 times (1-h each) per week for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood and tissue samples (the gastrocnemius muscle, heart, kidney, and thoracic aorta) were collected following contractile properties of the gastrocnemius muscle in situ weredetermined. In the collected tissues, oxidative stress (e.g., lipid oxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity) and serum ADM levels were measured. 6-week L-NAME administration per se (Group L) led to a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to other groups. Results: Importantly, 6-week exercise caused a protective effect of high blood pressure in the rats received L-NAME (Group LE). The level of ADM was lower in the rats received L-NAME than that of the control group. L-NAME increased lipid peroxidation in the thoracic aorta and decreased superoxide dismutase in the heart, kidney and muscle, and decreased catalase and glutathione in the heart. However, the exercise intervention did not have protective effect on the L-NAME-mediated oxidative damage in the collected tissues. Conclusion: In conclusion, 6-week exercise intervention rescued rats from high blood pressure, but did not have ameliorative effect on the decreased ADM levels.","output":"The effect of swimming training on adrenomedullin levels, oxidative stress variables, and gastrocnemius muscle contractile properties in hypertensive rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to affect both the occurrence and the reporting of abuse or neglect in vulnerable adults in a variety of ways.

However, not all ARGs pose serious threats to public health, highlighting the importance of identifying those that are high-risk. Here, we developed an omics-based framework to evaluate ARG risk considering human-associated-enrichment, gene mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our framework classifies human-associated, mobile ARGs (3.6% of all ARGs) as the highest risk, which we further differentiate as current threats (Rank I; 3%) - already present among pathogens - and future threats (Rank II; 0.6%) - novel resistance emerging from non-pathogens. Our framework identified 73 current threat ARG families. Of these, 35 were among the 37 high-risk ARGs proposed by the World Health Organization and other literature; the remaining 38 were significantly enriched in hospital plasmids. By evaluating all pathogen genomes released since framework construction, we confirmed that ARGs that recently transferred into pathogens were significantly enriched in Rank II (future threats). Lastly, we applied the framework to gut microbiome genomes from fecal microbiota transplantation donors. We found that although ARGs were widespread (73% of genomes), only 8.9% of genomes contained high-risk ARGs.

Our secondary aim was to modify the LPS in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic to produce a no-examination variant for use in this instance. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre external validation study. SETTING: Six different secondary care institutions across the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 16 years old who were referred to ENT with any uncomplicated sore throat such a tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess (PTA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for both the original LPS model and the modified model for COVID-19. RESULTS: The LPS model had sensitivity and specificity calculated at 98% and 79%, respectively. The LPS has a high negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was slightly lower at 63%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, including the area under the curve (AUROC), was 0.888 which indicates very good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: External validation of the LPS against an independent geographically diverse population yields high NPV.

Whether LCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of LCBDE-PC for patients with PUAS. METHODS From June 2011 to September 2019, 1167 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures for choledocholithiasis were reviewed retrospectively. Perioperative outcomes were compared between patients with and without PUAS in un-matched and matched cohorts. RESULTS LCBDE-PC was performed successfully in 88.3% of patients with PUAS, and 92.5% of patients without PUAS (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that PUAS was not a risk factor that affected successful performance of LCBDE-PC. Although a higher rate of conversion to open surgery and longer operative time were observed in patients with PUAS, no significant differences were found between patients with and without PUAS in multivariate and propensity score analysis (P > 0.05). A predictive nomogram for LCBDE-PC failure was developed based on potential predictors from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Successful performance of LCBDE-PC was associated with operative time. A linear regression model for operative time showed impacted stone in the CBD and intraoperative laser use was the most important factor in determining the operative time. CONCLUSION LCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS. However, patients with PUAS with a high possibility of LCBDE-PC failure from the nomogram and a longer operative time from the linear regression model should be cautious when undergoing LCBDE-PC.","output":"Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with primary closure is beneficial for patients with previous upper abdominal surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has produced a huge health, economic and psychological collapse in our society.

So far, there is no complete survey of older patients in a German district that includes both outpatients and inpatients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we aimed to investigate risk factors, mortality, and functional outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 aged 70 and older living in the district of Tbingen in the southwest of Germany. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all 256 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in one of the earliest affected German districts during the first wave of the disease from February to April 2020. To ensure inclusion of all infected patients, we analysed reported data from the public health department as well as the results of a comprehensive screening intervention in all nursing homes of the district (n = 1169). Furthermore, we examined clinical data of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109). RESULTS: The all-cause mortality was 18%. Screening in nursing homes showed a point-prevalence of 4.6%. 39% of residents showed no COVID-specific symptoms according to the official definition at that time. The most important predictors of mortality were the need for inpatient treatment (odds ratio (OR): 3.95 [95%-confidence interval (CI): 2.00-7.86], p<0.001) and care needs before infection (non-hospitalized patients: OR: 3.79 [95%-CI: 1.01-14.27], p = 0.037, hospitalized patients: OR: 2.89 [95%-CI 1.21-6.92], p = 0.015). Newly emerged care needs were a relevant complication of COVID-19: 27% of previously self-sufficient patients who survived the disease were not able to return to their home environment after discharge from the hospital.

Comparing the dynamics and outcomes of these nested epidemics could improve our understanding of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and help public health officials, political leaders, and other managers with real-time risk assessment across multiple geographic levels. Cross-outbreak comparisons are challenging due to their variable dates of introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, rates of transmission, case detection rates, and asynchronous and diverse management interventions. Here, we present a new graphical method for comparing ongoing COVID-19 epidemics by using disease burden as a natural timescale for comparison. Trajectories of growth rates of cases over the timescale of lagged deaths per-capita produces coherent visual comparisons of epidemics that are otherwise incoherent and asynchronous in the timescale of calendar dates or incomparable using non-stationary measures of burden such as cases. Applied to US COVID-19 outbreaks, this approach intuitively depicts multiple findings including early lockdowns reducing transmission at fewer deaths per-capita early in the epidemic, reopenings coinciding clearly with resurgent summer epidemics, and peaks in unmitigated epidemics that, while separated in time and place, converge to a population fatality rate lower than current, commonly used estimates based on infection fatality rates and herd immunity thresholds. Our method uses early and minimally mitigated epidemics, like that in NYC in March-April 2020 and Sweden in later 2020, to define what we call epidemic resistance lines (ERLs) or hypothesized upper bounds of epidemic speed and burden. ERLs from less-mitigated epidemics allow cross-outbreak benchmarking, for example of resurgent summer epidemics in the US. In particular, the unmitigated NYC epidemic resistance line appears to bound the growth rates of 3,000 US counties and funnel growth rates across counties to their peaks where growth rates equal zero in the fall and winter of 2020 before vaccines could be widely administered. Corroboration of upper-bounds on epidemic trajectories allowed early predictions of mortality burden for unmitigated COVID-19 epidemics in these populations, predictions that were more accurate for counties in states without mask-wearing mandates. We discuss how this method could be used for future epidemics, including seasonal epidemics caused by influenza or ongoing epidemics caused by new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemics on a Timescale of Burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Socioeconomic factors such as elevated incidence of chronic disease, overcrowding, and increased occupational exposure result in higher risk of infectious disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared to disproportionately affect communities affected by deprivation and discrimination, who also appear to be at greater risk of severe disease. Our aim was to investigate the evolution of the socioeconomic groups affected by COVID-19 over the course of the first wave of the pandemic by examining patients presenting to an acute NHS trust. Study design: and methods: A retrospective study using the postcodes of patients presenting to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust who tested PCR-positive for COVID-19 were used to determine average house price and index of multiple deprivation. These were used as markers of affluence to examine the trend in the socioeconomic status of affected patients from February to May 2020. Results: 384 cases were included. The postcodes of those individuals who were initially infected had higher average house prices and index of multiple deprivation, both of which followed downward trends as the outbreak progressed. Conclusion: Our data shows that the outbreak spread from higher to lower affluence groups through the course of the pandemic. We hypothesise that this was due to wealthier individuals initially transmitting the virus from abroad. Therefore, an earlier and more effective quarantine could have reduced spread to members of the community at greater risk of infection and harm. We suggest that hospitals systematically record the socioeconomic status of affected individuals in order to monitor trends, identify those who may be at risk of severe disease, and to push for more equitable public health policy.","output":"Impact of Affluence on the Local Spread of SARS-CoV2 during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSARS-CoV2 infection causes severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Hyper-inflammation, coagulopathy and lymphopenia are associated with pathology and poor outcomes in these patients. Cell-free (cf) DNA is prominent in COVID-19 patients, amplifies inflammation and promotes coagulopathy and immune dysfunction. We hypothesized that cf-DNA clearance by nebulised dornase alfa may reduce inflammation and improve disease outcomes. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of nebulized dornase alfa in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MethodsIn this randomised controlled single-centre phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, we recruited adult patients admitted to hospital that exhibited stable oxygen saturation ([]94%) on supplementary oxygen and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level []30mg/L post dexamethasone treatment. Participants were randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive twice-daily nebulised dornase alfa in addition to best available care (BAC) or BAC alone for seven days or until hospital discharge. A 2:1 ratio of historical controls to treated individuals (HC, 2:1) were included as the primary endpoint comparators. The primary outcome was a reduction in systemic inflammation measured by blood CRP levels over 7 days post-randomisation, or to discharge if sooner. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included time to discharge, time on oxygen, D-dimer levels, lymphocyte counts and levels of circulating cf-DNA. ResultsWe screened 75 patients and enrolled 39 participants out of which 30 in dornase alfa arm, and 9 in BAC group. We also matched the recruited patients in the treated group (N=30) to historical controls in the BAC group (N=60). For the the primary outcome, 30 patients in the dornase alfa were compared to 69 patients in the BAC group. Dornase alfa treatment reduced CRP by 33% compared to the BAC group at 7-days (P=0.01). The dornase alfa group least squares mean CRP was 23.23 mg/L (95% CI 17.71 to 30.46) and the BAC group 34.82 mg/L (95% CI 28.55 to 42.47). A significant difference was also observed when only randomised participants were compared. Furthermore, compared to the BAC group, the chance of live discharge was increased by 63% in the dornase alfa group (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.61, P=0.03), lymphocyte counts were improved (least-square mean: 1.08 vs 0.87, P=0.02) and markers of coagulopathy such as D-dimer were diminished (least-square mean: 570.78 vs 1656.96g/mL, P=0.004). Moreover, the dornase alfa group exhibited lower circulating cf-DNA levels that correlated with CRP changes over the course of treatment. No differences were recorded in the rates and length of stay in the ICU or the time on oxygen between the groups. Dornase alfa was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, treatment with nebulised dornase alfa resulted in a significant reduction in inflammation, markers of immune pathology and time to discharge. The effectiveness of dornase alfa in patients with acute respiratory infection and inflammation should be investigated further in larger trials.","output":"Anti-inflammatory therapy with nebulised dornase alfa in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Children with asthma who are physically active have a better quality of life, emphasizing the importance of activity monitoring and promotion in daily life. The validity of self-reported activity measurements has been questioned in pediatric populations. In this study, we aim to compare the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) with objectively measured PA using accelerometry. Design: In this comparison study, the pooled dataset of two cross-sectional studies was used, which prospectively home-monitored PA using the alternative self-report PAQ-C questionnaire as well as with the criterion standard accelerometry (Actigraph wGT3X-BT and GT1M). Participants:Ninety children with pediatrician-diagnosed asthma participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures:Correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relation between the PAQ-C and accelerometer data. The predictive value of the PAQ-C in differentiating between achieving and failing the recommended daily level of moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The results showed weak to moderate correlations of the PAQ-C with the accelerometer data (r = 0.29C0.47). A PAQ-C cutoff of 3.09 showed the best performance on predicting whether the recommended level of MVPA was achieved. With this cutoff, 21 of the 39 children that did achieve their daily MVPA level (53.8% sensitivity) and 33 of the 46 children that did fail their daily MVPA level (71.7% specificity) were correctly classified. A PAQ-C score of 3.5 revealed a negative predictive value of 100% for assessing physical inactivity. Conclusion: This study revealed a weak relation between the PAQ-C and PA assessed with accelerometry. However, a PAQ-C score of 3.5 or higher might be used as a low-cost and easy-to-use PA screening tool for ruling out physical inactivity in a portion of the pediatric asthma population.

Studies have shown that Viral titres peak within the first week of symptoms but may decline later hampering RT-PCR-based diagnostic strategies. Exact estimate is difficult under high-risk screening strategy with evidences of having large number of asymptomatic cases. This has prompted a call for adoption of antibody testing as potential source of data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 7000 was conducted for 15 days including all the 85 wards under Indore Municipal Corporation. Stratified Random Sampling was used to collect the samples. Trained teams collected basic sociodemographic information and serum samples which were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to COVID-19 using ICMR-Kavach IgG ELISA kits. The data collected was compiled and analysed using appropriate statistical software. RESULTS: Overall weighted seroprevalence of the study population was found to be 7.75%. The prevalence in males and females was comparable (7.91% vs 7.57%). Highest seropositivity (10.04%) was seen among individuals aged more than 60 years. Total number of infections in the population were estimated to be 2,03,160. Overall Case Infection Ratio was found to be 27.43. CONCLUSION: The current seroprevalence study provides information on proportion of the population exposed, but the correlation between presence and absence of antibodies is not a marker of total or partial immunity. It must also be noted that more than 90 percent of the population is still susceptible for COVID-19 infection. Hence, non-pharmaceutical interventions like respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, hand sanitization, usage of personal protective equipment such as masks and implementation of public health measures need to be continued.","output":"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Indore, Madhya Pradesh: A community-based cross-sectional study, August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 vaccine success has lessons for action on climate change","output":"A tale of two crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat.

In the standard care group, six patients received corticosteroids by the attending physician during treatment and excluded from the ITT population.

Generally, the homogeneity of a battery pack is evaluated by characterizing the cells individually in terms of capacity, mass, impedance. Particularly, high quality electrochemical data heavily relies on the availability of high precision current source to minimize the discrepancy induced by the channel-to-channel variation. Here, a facile and precise measurement method is reported for screening cell-to-cell variations, in which voltage is the only indicator parameter independent of high precision current source. In detail, by connecting the cells in series (CiS), the measurement error of electrochemical data caused by stability and discrepancy of current sources among different charge/discharge equipment can be effectively avoided. The findings of this work showed that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply and sensitively detected with CiS configuration. For example, the relative standard deviation, which is the evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity, was 2.14% based on CiS while it was 0.43% based on individual measurements. The simple and precise CiS measurement is promising for evaluation of cell quality or module integration quality. In addition, this work can also provide a solid foundation for the development of detection algorithms for battery management systems to rapidly monitor battery homogeneity.","output":"A Facile Approach to High Precision Detection of Cell-to-Cell Variation for Li-ion Batteries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to reveal the quality changes of soy protein-based meat analogues at 4 C, and to investigate the efficacy of antimicrobial packaging on maintaining the qualities of meat analogues during 10 days of storage.

During chemotherapy and active cancer treatment, disease-modifying therapies (conventional and biologic) are often stopped. In some cases, the potential benefits versus risks of restarting usual therapies have to be balanced against risks of suppressing disease activity with high-dose steroids. Risks of infection (common and atypical) need to be considered. Case report - Case description A is a 67-year-old female non-smoker diagnosed with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RF, anti CCCP positive) in 2008. Other conditions include type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnoea. Due to active disease, despite triple therapy (methotrexate, sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine), anti-TNF therapy (etanercept) commenced in 2009 with primary non-response. However, she responded well to B-cell therapy (rituximab) in conjunction with oral methotrexate (25mg weekly) receiving annual infusions from 2010 to 2016. In 2017, an elective sleeve gastrectomy procedure for high BMI was abandoned after peritoneal deposits of concern were noted. Histology and CT imaging were consistent with a primary peritoneal malignancy (Stage 3c low-grade serous adenocarcinoma). Treatment involved debulking surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpinoophorectomy, omentectomy) and tamoxifen. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis stalled during this period but as frequent steroids were required for active joint inflammation, in agreement with the oncologists, she had a rituximab cycle in 2018. Unfortunately, in 2019 she had signs of cancer progression (elevated tumour markers, CT imaging) and has subsequently started carboplatin chemotherapy. She has been unable to continue methotrexate or rituximab pending completion of the chemotherapy cycles (ongoing). However, her arthritis is now uncontrolled without increased steroids. Due to recurrent flares, her maintenance dose has been increased from 5mg to 7.510mg prednisolone daily until we can establish if it is safe and appropriate to recommence her usual arthritis regime. Even without disease-modifying therapy like methotrexate and rituximab, risk of infection (including atypical ones) is still significant with the combination of chemotherapy and steroids. Risk of progressive joint damage and adverse quality of life with active arthritis also needs to be considered. Staffing crises, exacerbated by COVID pandemic issues, have added to complexity of decision making and coordination of regular multidisciplinary discussions regarding treatment. Case report - Discussion Cancer is a known association in rheumatoid arthritis patients with a twofold higher risk of lymphoma compared to the general population. Whether condition or treatment affects risk remains unclear as immune dysregulation is relevant in both autoimmunity and cancer. Paraneoplastic, recent onset arthritis, chemotherapy- or immunotherapy-induced arthralgia/arthritis are also well documented. This case had a seropositive rheumatoid arthritis phenotype quite a few years prior to cancer diagnosis. Primary peritoneal cancer is uncommon, often presenting as in this case as an incidental finding. It is usually treated like ovarian cancer Whilst methotrexate has been implicated in lung cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, overall safety data suggest any risk is quite low (e.g., EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders usually resolve with drug discontinuation). It is also a known chemotherapeutic agent. Anti-TNF treatment algorithms generally exclude patients with recent cancer. Rituximab, originally developed as a cancer drug, is not thought to affect risk of cancer development or progression. Treatment with disease-modifying therapy (conventional and biologics) is often withheld in patients with active malignan y undergoing chemotherapy due to a theoretical risk of potentiated immunosuppression and toxicity, particularly cytopaenias. However, maintaining arthritis control with glucocorticoids also has short- and long-term risks. Combining chemotherapy agents like carboplatin with methotrexate has been used for urothelial carcinoma and can be well tolerated with close monitoring of haematological parameters. Thus, it could be argued this patient is at risk of infections whichever treatment approach is taken and regaining control of arthritis with recommencement of methotrexate and rituximab is much better for her quality of life. Regular multidisciplinary discussions are important to outline risks versus benefits of combined treatment. This may be difficult in practice during staffing crises. Covid risk in patients receiving rituximab and/or chemotherapy, timing and response to COVID vaccination are also important considerations. Case report - Key learning points Primary peritoneal cancer is uncommon and can present as an incidental finding Whilst treatment for progressive cancer is important, withholding rheumatoid arthritis treatment can have a significant adverse impact on quality of life Morbidity and mortality risks of stopping treatment versus combined treatment (cancer therapy and disease-modifying therapy) ideally needs to be fully discussed and agreed with the patient and all care providers C lack of named providers, restructuring, redeployment, multi-specialty care and a global pandemic can make coordination of this difficult","output":"O02 Cancer, Covid and control of RA C a toxic combination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two cases are presented involving neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections.

Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all the patients with histologically proven COM (16 years), presenting over 11 years (January 2009 to December 2019) to the Dermatology Department. We compiled the demographic data, clinical characteristics (morphology, extent, distribution), laboratory investigations, histopathology findings, imaging (ultrasound abdomen), c-KIT mutation results, where available, and other associated abnormalities, and grouped them according to the WHO classification for mastocytosis. Results Among the 66 patients with COM (M: F-1.6:1), 89.4% had onset before 2 years of age. The subtypes were: maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM: 44, 66.7%); mastocytoma of the skin (MOS: 19, 28.8%); diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM: 2, 3%) and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM: 1, 1.5%).

RESULTS: We found a substantial short-term elevation in primary care use in all age groups, with men generally having a higher relative increase (men 20C44 years: 522%, 95%CI = 509C535, 45C69 years: 439%, 95%CI = 426C452, 70 years: 199%, 95%CI = 180C218) than women (20C44 years: 342, 95%CI = 334C350, 45C69 years = 375, 95%CI = 365C385, 70 years: 156%, 95%CI = 141C171) at 1 month following positive test.

Functional MR in chronic HFrEF reflects primarily the severity of LV dysfunction and is not related to structural alterations of the mitral valvular apparatus. FMR in patients with HFrEF independently of the etiology of HFrEF and its underlying mechanisms, contributes to progression of the symptoms of HF and is independent predictor of worse clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) and its clinical implications in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS: We enrolled 146 consecutive adult patients with CHF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who presented to outpatient clinics. All patients underwent clinical and physical examination. Baseline examination included medical history, detailed assessment of current medication, electrocardiogram recording, transthoracic echocardiogram and comorbidities. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was defined in line with the new guidelines as history of HF signs and symptoms as well as a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) below 40%. Cardiovascular risk factors were recorded according to the respective guidelines. FMR was defined and graded according to the ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease. The extent of FMR was assessed at baseline and after a median follow-up period of 4 years in 146 consecutive HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%). All of the patients received the heart failure (HF) medications in agreement with 2016 and 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. Major adverse cardiac events were defined as a composite of all-cause death and the need for admission for HF. RESULTS: A total of 146 chronic HFrEF patients (mean age of 6311 years, 62% male, mean LVEF of 2511%) of which 19% patients had severe FMR at baseline, with a mean EROA of 31.42.7 mm2 and a mean Reg Vol of 45.95.3 ml. There was a significant interaction between FMR and NYHA functional class in predicting death or need for hospitalization, (P < 0.0001 for the interaction term FMR NYHA III-IV). During a median follow-up period of 4.2 (IQR) 3.1-5.8) years, the primary endpoint occurred in 52 (36%) patients (21 HF admissions, and 31 deaths). There was a strong graded association between the presence and degree of FMR and risk of death or admission (P <0.0001) at 4 years follow-up period. Regarding HF therapy, 129 patients (88%) received RAAS antagonists, 17 patients (12%) received ARNI, 86 patients (59%) received beta-blockers, 75 patients (51%) were treated with MRA. 31 patients (21%) underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with a response rate of 64%. 24 patients (16%) underwent ICD implantation. CONCLUSION: Guideline-directed medical therapy is the first-line treatment for chronic HF patients who also have FMR. After this first-line approach, surgical or MitraClip transcatheter therapy can be considered in patients with persistent severe and symptomatic FMR in order to improve symptoms, quality of life and functional status.","output":"Clinical Implications of Functional Mitral Regurgitation Severity in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a new clustering algorithm to identify groups of countries.

Immature female Wistar rats (25 days old) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 20 IU in 0.2 mL) or vehicle 48 hours before euthanasia. Tissue distributions of Ang-(1C7), Mas receptor, and ACE2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, along with angiotensin II (Ang II) localization, while the mRNA expression levels of Mas receptor and ACE2 were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we determined the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and ACE by fluorometric assays. After eCG treatment, we found strong immunoreactivity for Ang-(1C7) and Mas primarily in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II appeared in the granulosa but not in the thecal layer. Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment increased Mas and ACE2 mRNA expression compared with control animals (3.3- and 2.1-fold increase, respectively; P < .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme and NEP activities were lower, while PEP activity was higher in the eCG-treated rats (P < .05). These data show gonadotropin-induced changes in the ovarian expression of Ang-(1C7), Mas receptor, and ACE2.

However, persistent macrophage accumulation leads to chronic inflammation. Platelets are emerging as key modulators of the inflammatory response. Here, we identify that platelet C-type-lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) is a crucial immunomodulatory receptor through the interaction with podoplanin, upregulated on inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, platelet CLEC-2 upregulates the expression of podoplanin and its co-ligands CD44 and ERM proteins, leading to actin rearrangement and promotion of cell migration; this is mimicked by recombinant CLEC-2-Fc (rCLEC-2-Fc). Treatment of LPS-challenged mice with rCLEC-2-Fc induces a rapid emigration of peritoneal macrophages to mesenteric lymph nodes, through a gradient generated by the podoplanin ligand, CCL21, to prime T cells. We propose that crosslinking podoplanin using rCLEC-2-Fc is a novel, cell-specific strategy to accelerate macrophage removal from the site of inflammation, and hence promote the resolution of the inflammatory response.

Among admitted children, 82.6% were under 5 years, 96.1% had respiratory symptoms and 11% had seizures. Six children had encephalopathy of whom four died; two survivors had severe neurological sequelae. Other features included gastroenteritis, otitis media, myositis and hepatitis. Complications included shock (10.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (6.1%). Evidence of bacterial/fungal infection was present in 71 (22.9%). Oxygen was required by 123 children (39.7%), high-dependency/intensive care by 47 (15.2%), 17 (5.5%) received high-flow oxygen and 29 (9.4%) required mechanical ventilation. There were no significantly increased odds of needing intensive care or of dying in children with underlying diseases or among different age groups but those with underlying central nervous system (CNS) diseases had higher odds of needing high-dependency/intensive care [odds ratio (OR) 2.35, p = 0.046]. Significantly, children with CNS symptoms had nearly seven times higher odds of needing mechanical ventilation (OR 6.85, p < 0.001) and over three times higher odds of dying (OR 3.31, p = 0.009). : Lay summary H1N1 Influenza (swine flu) emerged as a global pandemic in 2009 and continues to affect children all over the world.

A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior-level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.","output":"COVID-19 and paediatric health services: A survey of paediatric physicians in Australia and New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalized children with COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the dedicated COVID-19 hospital of a tertiary care referral center in North India. Consecutive children aged 14 y or younger who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab between 1 April 2020 and 15 July 2020 were included. RESULTS: Of 31 children with median (IQR) age of 33 (9-96) mo, 9 (29%) were infants. About 74% (n = 23) had history of household contact. Comorbidities were noted in 6 (19%) children. More than half (58%) were asymptomatic. Of 13 symptomatic children, median (IQR) duration of symptoms was 2 (1-5.5) d. Fever (32%) was most common followed by cough (19%), rapid breathing (13%), diarrhea (10%) and vomiting (10%). Severe [n = 4, 13%] and critical [n = 1, 3%] illnesses were noted more commonly in infants with comorbidities. Three (10%) children required PICU admission and invasive ventilation; one died.

The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown, and how some non-cardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective follow-up design was adopted. A total of 1,160 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients' medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the associations between comorbidities (cardiometabolic or non-cardiometabolic diseases), clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19. Results: Overall, 158 (13.6%) patients were diagnosed with severe illness and 32 (2.7%) had unfavorable outcomes. Hypertension (2.87, 1.30-6.32), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (3.57, 2.32-5.49), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3.78, 1.81-7.89), fatty liver disease (7.53, 1.96-28.96), hyperlipidemia (2.15, 1.26-3.67), other lung diseases (6.00, 3.01-11.96), and electrolyte imbalance (10.40, 3.00-26.10) were independently linked to increased odds of being severely ill.

Thus, they form the foundation for many research projects which may contribute to improving medical care. With the establishment of the German Biobank Node and Alliance, expertise in biobanking is bundled and strengthened. An important component within this research infrastructure is the set-up of an information technology (IT) network for allowing feasibility requests across individual biobanks. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe relevant aspects that have shaped the journey to interconnect biobanks, to enhance their visibility within the research-community, to harmonize data, and to enable feasibility searches to support access to available data and biosamples. METHODS: To achieve this task, we resorted to a wide variety of methods: we ran a requirement analysis, decided on the mode of operation for the federated team of IT-developers and on the development approach itself, took related national and international initiatives into account, and concluded with evaluations of the developed software artefacts and the operation of the entire chain of applications. RESULTS: We drew an IT framework including all heterogeneous data aspects derived from our requirement analysis and developed a comprehensive IT infrastructure. The successful implementation benefited from a smooth interaction of a federated IT team distributed across all participating sites that was even able to manage a major technology change mid-project. Authentication and project management services from associated partners could be integrated and the graphic user interface for an intuitive search tool for biospecimens was designed iteratively. The developed code is open source to ensure sustainability and the local implementation is concluded and functioning. The evaluation of the components was positive. CONCLUSIONS: The entire project had given ample opportunity for challenges, predictable and unpredictablefrom the mode of operation to changing some of the initial ideas. We learned our lessons concerning personnel, budget planning and technical as well as manual monitoring as well as some requirements arising only during the process of the project.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several LMS platforms were adopted in Saudi Arabian institutions, such as Moodle and Blackboard. However, in order to adopt e-learning and operate LMS platforms, there is a need to investigate factors that influence the capability of faculty to utilize e-learning and its perceived benefits on students. This paper examines how training support and LMS readiness factors influence the capability of faculty to adopt e-learning and student perceived benefits. A quantitative research method was conducted using an online questionnaire survey method. Research data was collected from 274 faculty members, who used Moodle as a main LMS platform, at Shaqra University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The results reveal that training support and LMS readiness have a positive influence on the facultys capability to adopt e-learning, which leads to enhancing students perceived benefits.

However, its impact on stress and subsequent professional pathways is not well understood. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. Methods: : An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. Results: : Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (n=627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual;22% reconsidered their residency choice;and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations;decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match;and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25  4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases;being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency;and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on the medical curriculum and well-being of clerks. A number of student-identified solutions were proposed to reduce stress. The implementation of these solutions throughout the Canadian medical training system should be considered.","output":"Repercussions of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Well-being and Training of Medical Clerks: A Pan-Canadian Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development and worsening of eating disorder (ED) symptoms in adolescents and young adults.

An effective TB subunit vaccine is urgently needed. Proper selection of the delivery system for the vaccine is crucial for inducing an appropriate immune response tailored to control the target pathogen. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CMFO subunit vaccines against primary progressive TB in two different adjuvant systems: the MTO oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion composed of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), trehalose-6,60-dibehenate (TDB), and oil in water emulsion MF59 and the DMT liposome containing dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), and trehalose-6,60-dibehenate (TDB). Our results demonstrated that the DMT-adjuvanted CMFO could confer more significant protection against M. tuberculosis infection than the CMFO/MTO did in mice. In particular, the adjuvant DMT showed a stronger ability than the O/W emulsion to adjuvant CMFO subunit vaccine and enhanced protection, attributed to elicit Th1-biased responses, strong Th1/Th17 cytokine responses, and IFN-(+) or IL-2(+) T cell responses. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the liposome delivery system shows more effectiveness to adjuvant TB subunit vaccine than O/W emulsion and highlight the importance of adjuvant formulation for the better efficacy of a protein vaccine.","output":"Differential Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Elicited by MTO- and DMT-Adjuvanted CMFO Subunit Vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Most patients with acute bronchitis who seek medical care are treated with antibiotics, although the effectiveness of this intervention is uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the duration of cough and sputum production by approximately one-half day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, ?0.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, ?0.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, ?0.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.","output":"Antibiotics in acute bronchitis: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a complex interplay between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics and host immune responses. Hosts with altered immunity, including solid organ transplant recipients, may be at increased risk of complications and death due to COVID-19. A synthesis of the available data on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed to inform therapeutic and preventative strategies in this special population. Recent Findings: Few studies have directly compared immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between transplant recipients and the general population. Like non-transplant patients, transplant recipients mount an exuberant inflammatory response following initial SARS-CoV2 infection, with IL-6 levels correlating with disease severity in some, but not all studies. Transplant recipients display anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and activated B cells in a time frame and magnitude similar to non-transplant patients-limited data suggest these antibodies can be detected within 15 days of symptom onset and may be durable for several months. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia, a hallmark of COVID-19, is more profound in transplant recipients, but SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells can be detected among patients with both mild and severe disease. Summary: The limited available data indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are similar between transplant recipients and the general population, but no studies have been sufficiently comprehensive to understand nuances between organ types or level of immunosuppression to meaningfully inform individualized therapeutic decisions. The ongoing pandemic provides an opportunity to generate higher-quality data to support rational treatment and vaccination strategies in this population.","output":"Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still ongoing, and infections among health care workers are not uncommon How to complete the diagnosis and treatment of orthopaedic diseases and prevent the spread of the epidemic is a great challenge for orthopaedic surgeons On the basis of exposure history and medical conditions of orthopaedic patients, the hierarchical control is very important for reduction of the exposure for the medical staff and patients In order to ensure medical safety and reduce the consumption of materials for the epidemic prevention, we classified the hospitalized orthopaedic patients into three classes and six levels, to provide effective references for all levels of hospitals in orthopaedic clinical work Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association","output":"Principles of diagnosis and treatment of orthopaedic diseases during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has enabled the rapid, unbiased detection and identification of microbes without pathogen-specific reagents, culturing, or a priori knowledge of the microbial landscape. mNGS data analysis requires a series of computationally intensive processing steps to accurately determine the microbial composition of a sample. Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments. FINDINGS: We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.

This study assumed the consequences of sickness absence would differ by diagnostic group or by patient care type. The aim was to investigate sickness absence due to various diagnosis groups as a predictor for subsequent inpatient- and specialized outpatient care while controlling for familial confounding. METHODS: We utilized the register data of 69,552 twin individuals between 16 and 80years of age (48% women). The first incident sickness absence spell, from baseline year 2005, including diagnosis of sickness absence was our primary exposure of interest and we followed them until the first incident inpatient- and specialized outpatient care episode with main diagnosis code or until 31.12.2013. RESULTS: A total of 7464 incident sickness absence spells took place (11%), 42% had inpatient care and 83% specialized outpatient care (mean follow-up time 3.2years, SD 3.1years). All the main sickness absence diagnosis groups were associated with increased risk of future care in comparison to no sickness absence. Controlling for confounders attenuated the associations in magnitude but with retaining direction, and we could not confirm an effect of familial factors. CONCLUSIONS: Sickness absence predicts both inpatient- and specialized outpatient care and the association is universal across diagnosis groups. The lower survival time and incidence rates of inpatient than specialized outpatient care point towards severity of diseases assumption.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom sudden smell loss for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom sudden smell loss in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom sudden smell loss can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 97% for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","output":"Predictive Value of Sudden Olfactory Loss in the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical laboratory testing has been an essential part of COVID-19 management.

Results: A total of 66 hospitalized patients [admitted in covid-19 ward or liver intensive care unit (ICU)] were included. 22 patients had covid-19 alone while 20 patients had cirrhosis plus covid-19. 24 patients had liver cirrhosis plus bacterial sepsis. Among cirrhosis patients, most common aetiology was alcohol. ICAM1 was increased (p=0.003) while vegfr1 (p<0.0001) and Ang1 (p<0.0001) were reduced in covid-19 patients with cirrhosis, as compared to covid-19 patients alone. Endothelial biomarkers between cirrhosis patients with severe covid-19 or with bacterial sepsis in the ICUs did not differ significantly. In these patients, ICAM1 levels significantly and independently predicted mortality (HR:3.24;1.19-8.86) along with MELD, renal and coagulation failures. The area under the curve for ICAM1 was 0.74, MELD was 0.60 and combined ICAM1 and MELD was 0.70. ICAM1 also positively correlated with the composite organ failure scores recorded 3-5 days post ICU admission (CLIF-OF and SOFA) in this subgroup of patients. Conclusion: The study indicates that in patients with liver cirrhosis, elevated plasma ICAM1 serve as an independent predictor of severe covid-19 or sepsis associated 28-day mortality. Lay Summary: Bacterial sepsis and covid-19 lead to increased mortality in cirrhosis patients. In this study, we demonstrate that high plasma levels of ICAM1, an endothelial injury biomarker is one of the important factors predicting mortality in critically-ill cirrhotic patients having severe covid-19 or bacterial sepsis.","output":"Elevated plasma ICAM1 levels predict 28-day mortality in cirrhotic patients with COVID-19 or bacterial sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of various gastrointestinal diseases can lead to effective treatment and reduce the risk of many life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately, various small gastrointestinal lesions are undetectable during early-stage examination by medical experts. In previous studies, various deep learningCbased computer-aided diagnosis tools have been used to make a significant contribution to the effective diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, most of these methods were designed to detect a limited number of gastrointestinal diseases, such as polyps, tumors, or cancers, in a specific part of the human gastrointestinal tract. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis tool to assist medical experts in diagnosing various types of gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: Our proposed framework comprises a deep learningCbased classification network followed by a retrieval method. In the first step, the classification network predicts the disease type for the current medical condition. Then, the retrieval part of the framework shows the relevant cases (endoscopic images) from the previous database. These past cases help the medical expert validate the current computer prediction subjectively, which ultimately results in better diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: All the experiments were performed using 2 endoscopic data sets with a total of 52,471 frames and 37 different classes. The optimal performances obtained by our proposed method in accuracy, F1 score, mean average precision, and mean average recall were 96.19%, 96.99%, 98.18%, and 95.86%, respectively. The overall performance of our proposed diagnostic framework substantially outperformed state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis framework for identifying various types of gastrointestinal diseases. The results show the superiority of our proposed method over various other recent methods and illustrate its potential for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Our proposed network can be applicable to other classification domains in medical imaging, such as computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound sequences.","output":"Automated Diagnosis of Various Gastrointestinal Lesions Using a Deep LearningCBased Classification and Retrieval Framework With a Large Endoscopic Database: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delineating the origins and properties of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is critical for understanding their benefits and potential shortcomings. Therefore, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-reactive B cell repertoire in unexposed individuals by flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing. We found that 82% of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive B cells show a naive phenotype, which represents an unusually high fraction of total human naive B cells (0.1%). Approximately 10% of these naive S-reactive B cells shared an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing, an enrichment of 18-fold compared to the complete naive repertoire. A proportion of memory B cells, comprising switched (0.05%) and unswitched B cells (0.04%), was also reactive with S and some of these cells were reactive with ADAMTS13, which is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we report an average 37-fold enrichment of IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing in the S-reactive memory B cells compared to the unselected memory repertoire. This class of B cells targets a previously undefined non-neutralizing epitope on the S2 subunit that becomes exposed on S proteins used in approved vaccines when they transition away from the native pre-fusion state because of instability.

METHODS: Ternary ASDs with ritonavir, copovidone and surfactants (30:70:5 w/w/w) were prepared by rotary evaporation. ASD release performance was tested using Wood's intrinsic dissolution rate apparatus and compared to the binary drug-polymer ASD with 30% drug loading. Size measurement of amorphous droplets was performed using dynamic light scattering. Solid state characterization was performed using attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: All surfactant-containing ASDs showed improvement over the binary ASD. Span 85 and D--tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) showed complete release with no evidence of AAPS or crystallization whereas Span 20 and Tween 80 showed < 50% release with amorphous amorphous phase separation (AAPS). Span 20 also induced solution crystallization. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) showed very rapid, albeit incomplete (~ 80%) release. AAPS was not observed with SDS. However, crystallization on the dissolving solid surface was noted. Span 20 and TPGS formed the smallest and most size-stable droplets with ~ 1 m size whereas coalescence was noted with other surfactants. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactants improved the release performance relative to the binary ASD. Different surfactant types impacted overall performance to varying extents and affected different attributes. Overall, Span 85 showed best performance (complete release, no crystallization/AAPS and small droplet size).

Many efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since there is an imminent need to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Essentially all vaccines in most advanced phases are based on the induction of antibody response against either whole or part of spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We exploited this technology with the aim to identify a clinical candidate defined as DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens inducing a robust CD8+ T-cell response. This is a new vaccination approach employing a DNA expression vector encoding a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) showing an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells are internalized by antigen-presenting cells leading to cross-presentation of the associated antigens thereby priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we recovered DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and four viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. All fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity was generated. Most important, high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were found in bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized mice. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lung. EVs engineered with SARS-CoV-2 antigens proved immunogenic also in the human system through cross-priming assays carried out with ex vivo human cells. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.","output":"A new concept on anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: strong CD8+ T-cell immune response in both spleen and lung induced in mice by endogenously engineered extracellular vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B cell response plays a critical role against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study aims to systematically review the evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of intrauterine mother to fetus transmission. Literature searches were performed in the WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for SARS-CoV-2 using keywords and associated synonyms, search date up to 20 December 2020, no language restrictions. Results We included 106 studies assessing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their neonates: these studies comprised 40 reviews (21 fulfilled systematic review methodology, including risk of bias assessment of included studies) and 66 primary studies including 32 case reports (of up to two cases) and 34 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, prospective and retrospective case series, observational studies (including asymptomatic screening), database studies and a quality improvement project. Almost all were conducted in a hospital setting. The 32 case reports were considered to be at high risk of bias, due to the study design; across the 34 remaining primary studies, risk of bias was low to moderate. Sixteen case reports examined vertical transmission, which was not related to maternal symptomatology. For the cohort and case series studies, the percentage of positive neonates ranged from 0% to 22% across the studies. Twenty studies reported no positive vertical transmission. Three studies that reported the highest positivity rates of 11%, 15% and 22% had specifically selected neonates with a positive test (within up to 35 days) within the study population and were therefore more selective populations. Across the cohort and case series studies there were 65/2391 (2.7%) neonates born to mothers with a diagnosis of COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of birth. No evidence correlated maternal symptomatology to vertical transmission. Mode of delivery did not correlate with rates of vertical transmission. Of 25 studies, 7 identified SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue; some of these did not demonstrate vertical transmission to the neonate. No study reported the results of viral culture to detect SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The results of these studies indicate that vertical transmission is possible, but is not frequent, and factors that influence when vertical transmission occurs are unknown. Further studies using standardised methods to establish viral infection are needed to establish vertical transmission rates and to assess clinical and other conditions affecting transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and the role of vertical transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses: systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of RDN on renal oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI. METHODS Patients with resistant hypertension or the inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side effects were included. BOLD-MRI was performed before and 12 months after RDN.

METHODS One hundred and seventy-seven serum specimens were collected during the period of June to August, 2003 from children and adults who had been clinically diagnosed as SARS and who closely contacted with those diagnosed as SARS during SARS epidemic in Beijing. Serum specimens were also collected from 49 children from Anhui province which was non-epidemic region and 93 healthy kindergarten children without history of contacting with SARS patients in Beijing during SARS epidemic. Serum specimens collected from 90 healthy kindergarten children in Beijing in September 2002 were included in the study. All the 409 serum specimens were tested for specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by different methods including ELISA for specific IgM and IgG, whole antibodies against SARS-CoV, IFA for specific IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV, and Western-blot for IgG to expressed N protein from SARS-CoV. RESULTS The positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV ranged from 39.1% to 43.5% in the children who had been clinically diagnosed as SARS, zero in children and 6.0% to 9.0% in adults who had closely contacted with the clinically diagnosed SARS children. Among those clinically diagnosed SARS adult patients, the positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV were 57.1% to 71.4%. In children and adults who closely contacted with these clinically diagnosed SARS adult patients, the positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV were 0 to 9.7% and 4.4% to 7.1%, respectively.

DESIGN Case reports. SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Patient 1 is an 83-year-old woman. Patient 2 is a 75-year-old woman. Both were admitted to the hospital for massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which required multiple blood transfusions. Extensive workup revealed multiple diverticula in the small and large intestines without identification of any source of active bleeding in either patient. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity was performed. The terminal ileum at the ileocecal valve was identified and, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, the small bowel was transected. The distal end staple line was secured in end-to-side fashion to the proximal end, and the proximal end was brought out as an end ileostomy. Patients were then observed for bleeding into the ostomy bag or in the rectum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Localization of the source of bleeding as upper or lower, occurrence of surgical complications, and clinical outcome. RESULTS No intraoperative complications occurred in either patient. Patient 1 had significant bleeding into her ileostomy bag on postoperative day 1. She was taken back to the operating room for empirical small bowel resection. She was discharged, had no further bleeding, and underwent closure of the ileostomy 2 months later. The postoperative course of patient 2 was complicated by a small parastomal abscess that resolved with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. Patient 2 returned on postoperative day 22 with bleeding in the rectum. She was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic total colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis and ileostomy closure. Both patients recovered uneventfully and had no recurrent bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with these 2 patients suggests that in cases in which the risk of blind resection appears ill-advised, laparoscopic compartmentalization of the small bowel from the colon via end ileostomy may be safely performed.","output":"Laparoscopic ileostomy in severe, obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage: diagnostic laparoscopic ileostomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The French National Observatory for Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors conducted a national survey aiming to evaluate the potential effects of confinement on the population's physical activity levels and sedentary behaviors. METHODS: In close collaboration with the French Ministry of Sports and a selected expert committee, 3 different questionnaires investigating 3 subgroup populations were included in the survey: (1) children, (2) adolescents, and (3) adults. RESULTS: Forty-two percentage of children, 58.7% of adolescents, 36.4% of adults, and 39.2% of older people had reduced physical activity levels. Particularly, active transportation and endurance practices showed a significant decrease, while domestic, muscular strengthening, and flexibility activities increased. Sitting time and screen time increased, respectively, in 36.3% and 62.0% of children, 25.5% and 69.0% in adolescents, 24.6% and 41.0% in adults, and 36.1% and 32.1% in seniors. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 confinement period led to important modifications in individual movement behaviors at all ages, particularly favoring decreased physical activity and increased sedentariness.

We aimed to explore whether this impact showed seasonal characteristics and spatial variations related to the macro-climate. We applied two-way fixed-effect models to identify the effects of meteorological factors on COVID-19 transmission and used spatial analysis to explore their spatial-temporal characteristics with a relatively long-time span. The results showed that cold, dry and windless conditions aggravated COVID-19 transmission. The daily average temperature, humidity, and wind speed negatively affected the daily new cases. Humidity and temperature played a dominant role in this process. For the time series, the influences of meteorological conditions on COVID-19 had a periodic fluctuation of 3C4 months (in line with the seasons in Brazil). The turning points of this fluctuation occurred in seasonal changes time. Spatially, the negative effects of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission were clustered in the northeastern and central parts of Brazil. This is consistent with the range of arid climate types. Overall, the seasonality and similar climate types should be considered to estimate the spatial-temporal COVID-19 patterns.

We study the setting where the unknown parameter in each bandit instance can be decomposed into a global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. Then, we propose a novel two-stage estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way by using a combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). We embed this estimator within a bandit algorithm, and prove that it improves asymptotic regret bounds in the context dimension $d$; this improvement is exponential for data-poor instances. We further demonstrate how our results depend on the underlying network structure of bandit instances.

Loss of BLM activity leads to Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by extraordinary cancer risk and small stature. Here, we have analyzed the composition of the BLM complex during unperturbed S-phase and identified a direct physical interaction with the Mcm6 subunit of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Using distinct binding sites, BLM interacts with the N-terminal domain of Mcm6 in G1 phase and switches to the C-terminal Cdt1-binding domain of Mcm6 in S-phase, with a third site playing a role for Mcm6 binding after DNA damage. Disruption of Mcm6-binding to BLM in S-phase leads to supra-normal DNA replication speed in unperturbed cells, and the helicase activity of BLM is required for this increased replication speed. Upon disruption of BLM/Mcm6 interaction, repair of replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks is delayed and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. Our findings reveal that BLM not only plays a role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress, but that its physical interaction with Mcm6 is required in unperturbed cells, most notably in S-phase as a negative regulator of replication speed.","output":"A novel cell-cycle-regulated interaction of the Bloom syndrome helicase BLM with Mcm6 controls replication-linked processes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition in older people and represents a global health issue since it increases the risk of associated comorbidities and all-cause mortality.

The RABV, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases may be implicated in neuronal death due to an imbalance in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Parvalbumin (PV) and Secretagogin (Scgn), two members of the Calcium-Binding Proteins (CBPs) are useful neuronal markers responsible for calcium regulation and buffering with possible protective roles against infections. This study investigated whether infection with rabies virus causes variance in expression levels of PV and Scgn using the Challenge virus standard (CVS) and Nigerian Street Rabies virus (SRV) strains. Forty-eight, 4-week-old BALB/c mice strains were divided into two test groups and challenged with Rabies virus (RABV) infection and one control group. The presence of RABV antigen was verified by direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess PV and Scgn gene expression. Infection with both virus strains resulted in significant (p < 0.05) increases in expression during early infection. Mid-infection phase caused reduced expression for both genes. However, as infection progressed to the terminal phase, a lower increase in expression was measured. Gene expression and viral load correlation indicated no positive relationship. Neurons with these CBPs may have a greater capacity to buffer calcium and be more resistant to degenerative changes caused by RABV. This implies that, when PV and Scgn expression levels are kept adequately high, the integrity of neurons may be maintained and degeneration caused by RABV infection may be prevented or stopped, hence, these are possible constituents of effective rabies therapy.","output":"Rabies virus infection is associated with alterations in the expression of parvalbumin and secretagogin in mice brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a single year, a Canadian village had 34 individuals with microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis (TB) among 169 people with a new infection (20%).

SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative cohort of older adults. SUBJECTS: In total, 8,174 community-dwelling adults aged &#8805;50 years. METHODS: To define WTD, participants were asked: 'In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead?' Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. RESULTS: At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41-9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33-8.67)) were independently associated with WTD.Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2 years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (-44%) and loneliness (-19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up.Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up.

PCA was used to calculate the orthogonal transformation of the features, and mFCBF was used to select the best PCA features. The EMOTHAW database was used for depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) assessment. The process involved the augmentation of the training data by first augmenting the mood states such that all the data were the same size. Then, 80% of the training data was randomly selected, and a small random Gaussian noise was added to the extracted features. Automated machine learning was employed to train and test more than ten plain and ensembled classifiers. For all three moods, we obtained 100% accuracy results when detecting two possible grades of mood severities using this architecture. The results obtained were superior to the results obtained by using state-of-the-art methods, which enabled us to define the three mood states and provide precise information to the clinical psychologist. The accuracy results obtained when detecting these three possible mood states using this architecture were 82.5%, 72.8% and 74.56% for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively.","output":"Mood State Detection in Handwritten Tasks Using PCACmFCBF and Automated Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We describe the characteristics and short-term prognosis of in-patients with diabetes and COVID-19 admitted to a Belgian academic care center. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data on admission from patients with known or newly-diagnosed diabetes and confirmed COVID-19. First, survivors were compared to non-survivors to study the predictive factors of in-hospital death in patients with diabetes. Secondly, diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were matched for age and sex with non-diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, to study the prognosis and predictive factors of in-hospital death related to diabetes. RESULTS: Seventy-three diabetic patients were included. Mean age was 69 (14) years. Women accounted for 52%. Most patients had type 2 diabetes (89.0%), long-term complications of hyperglycemia (59.1%), and hypertension (80.8%). The case-fatality rate (CFR) was 15%. Non-survivors had more severe pneumonia based on imaging (p 0.029) and were less often treated with metformin (p 0.036). In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, CFR was 15.6% in diabetic (n = 64) and 25.0% in non-diabetic patients (n = 128), the difference being non-significant (p 0.194). Predictive factors of in-hospital death were elevated white blood cells count (HR 9.4, CI 1.50-58.8, p 0.016) and severe pneumonia on imaging (HR 25.0, CI 1.34-466, p 0.031) in diabetic patients, and cognitive impairment (HR 5.80, CI 1.61-20.9, p 0.007) and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.63, CI 1.54-20.6, p 0.009) in non-diabetic patients.

It is increasingly used off-label for other pediatric indications, though limited data exist describing safety and outcomes in these populations. This study describes TCZ use in JIA/CRS and other indications. Safety when administered during active infection and overall clinical outcomes were explored. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of inpatients in a large children's hospital who received IV TCZ from 1/2016-5/2021 for any indication. Data included demographics, indication, dose amount, number of doses, safety events on days 0-7 after TCZ, use of extracorporeal support (ES), presence of concurrent infection, and survival to discharge. Exploratory analyses assessed characteristics associated with mortality. RESULTS: Data from 103 TCZ courses (n=87 pts) were analyzed. Median age was 14 yrs, and 66% had a primary oncologic diagnosis or had received myelosuppressive treatment (ONC/M). Indications for TCZ included CRS (56%), autoimmune disease (27%), GVHD (5%), and COVID-19 (4%). Median TCZ dose was 8 mg/kg. 18% of courses were administered during active infection, and ES was used in 15% of courses. New onset of ALT and AST >3x upper limit of normal occurred in 25% and 33% of courses, respectively. In patients without an ONC/M diagnosis (n=21), 10% of courses resulted in new onset neutropenia and 3% thrombocytopenia. Overall survival to discharge was 83%. Covariates associated with mortality by univariable analysis included an ONC/M diagnosis (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.2-21], receipt of TCZ in an ICU (7 [1.8-41]), receipt of TCZ during active infection (3.8 [1-14), and use of ES (19 [4.6-91]). Only ES remained significant in multivariable analysis (OR 13 [3.1- 57]). CONCLUSIONS: TCZ is used for a range of pediatric inpatient indications, most commonly CRS. Risk factors for mortality are confounded by severity of illness, though administration during active infection was not independently associated with increased mortality. Prospective studies are needed to better understand the safety and efficacy of the off-label use of TCZ in children with inflammation.","output":"Real-world tocilizumab use in pediatric inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mortality in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increases in prothrombotic parameters, particularly D-dimer levels. Anticoagulation has been proposed as therapy to decrease mortality, often adjusted for illness severity. Objective We wanted to investigate whether anticoagulation improves survival in COVID-19 and if this improvement in survival is associated with disease severity. Methods This is a cohort study simulating an intention-to-treat clinical trial, by analyzing the effect on mortality of anticoagulation therapy chosen in the first 48 hours of hospitalization. We analyzed 3,625 COVID-19+ inpatients, controlling for age, gender, glomerular filtration rate, oxygen saturation, ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, and time period, all determined during the first 48 hours. Results Adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality with prophylactic use of apixaban (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, p = 0.001) and enoxaparin (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001). Therapeutic apixaban was also associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.57, p = 0.006) but was not more beneficial than prophylactic use when analyzed over the entire cohort or within D-dimer stratified categories. Higher D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality ( p < 0.0001). When adjusted for these same comorbidities within D-dimer strata, patients with D-dimer levels < 1 g/mL did not appear to benefit from anticoagulation while patients with D-dimer levels > 10 g/mL derived the most benefit. There was no increase in transfusion requirement with any of the anticoagulants used. Conclusion We conclude that COVID-19+ patients with moderate or severe illness benefit from anticoagulation and that apixaban has similar efficacy to enoxaparin in decreasing mortality in this disease.","output":"Anticoagulation in COVID-19: Effect of Enoxaparin, Heparin, and Apixaban on Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at higher risk of vaccine-preventable respiratory infections. However, advanced, homebound individuals may have less access to vaccinations. In light of COVID-19, understanding barriers to vaccination in PD may inform strategies to increase vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE: To identify influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination, among homebound and ambulatory individuals with PD and related disorders. METHODS: Cross-sectional US-based study among individuals with PD, ageda>a65 years, stratified as homebound or ambulatory. Participants completed semi-structured interviews on vaccination rates and barriers, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: Among 143 participants, 9.8% had missed all influenza vaccinations in the past 5 years, and 32.2% lacked any pneumococcal vaccination, with no between-group differences. Homebound participants (na=a41) reported difficulty traveling to clinic (pa<a0.01) as a vaccination barrier, and despite similar outpatient visit frequencies, had more frequent emergency department visits (31.7% vs. 9.8%, pa<a0.01) and hospitalizations (14.6% vs. 2.9%, pa=a0.03). Vaccine hesitancy was reported in 35% of participants, vaccine refusal in 19%, and 13.3% reported unvaccinated household members, with no between-group differences. Nearly 13% thought providers recommended against vaccines for PD patients, and 31.5% were unsure of vaccine recommendations in PD. CONCLUSION: Among a sample of homebound and ambulatory people with PD, many lack age-appropriate immunizations despite ample healthcare utilization. Many participants were unsure whether healthcare providers recommend vaccinations for people with PD.

This study aimed to compare outcome of diathermy and scalpel in RELIF procedure in PSD surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing RELIF procedure due to PSD at Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital between January 2012 and September 2012 were randomly assigned to diathermy (n=30) or scalpel (n=30) groups. The primary outcomes measured were duration of operation, drainage volume, postoperative numerical pain intensity scale (NPIS) scores, complications, duration of hospitalization length and time to return to daily activity. RESULTS The mean age was 26.2 years (17-44 years). The mean operation duration was significantly lower in diathermy group (p=0.0001). Postoperative total NPIS score within the first 24 h was significantly lower in diathermy group (p=0.001). However, there were not any significant differences in term of NPIS scores in day 3 and day 7. There were no significant differences in terms of total drain output, drain removal time and length of hospital stay. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of duration to sit comfortably, return to daily activity and work. Recurrence of PSD was emerged in one patient in the diathermy group.

Emotional CPR (eCPR) is a program and practice developed by persons with a lived experience of recovery from trauma or mental health challenges to train community members from diverse backgrounds to support others through mental health crises. eCPR trainers have found that eCPR may promote feelings of belonging by increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems. Thus, clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect would improve along with feelings of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of eCPR. METHODS: We employed a pre-post design with 151 individuals, including peer support specialists, service users, clinicians, family members, and nonprofit leaders, who participated in virtual eCPR trainings between April 20, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Instruments were administered before and after training and included the Herth Hope Scale; Empowerment Scale; Flourishing Scale (perceived capacity to support individuals); Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Active-Empathic Listening Scale (supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health challenges); Social Connectedness Scale (feelings of belonging and connection with others); Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and University of California, Los Angeles 3-item Loneliness Scale (symptoms and emotions). The eCPR fidelity scale was used to determine the feasibility of delivering eCPR with fidelity. We conducted 2-tailed paired t tests to examine posttraining improvements related to each scale. Additionally, data were stratified to identify pre-post differences by role. RESULTS: Findings indicate that it is feasible for people with a lived experience of a mental health condition to develop a program and train people to deliver eCPR with fidelity. Statistically significant pre-post changes were found related to one's ability to identify emotions, support others in distress, communicate nonverbally, share emotions, and take care of oneself, as well as to one's feelings of social connectedness, self-perceived flourishing, and positive affect (P&#8804;.05). Findings indicated promising evidence of pre-post improvements (not statistically significant) related to loneliness, empowerment, active-empathetic listening, mindfulness awareness, and hope. Nonprofit leaders and workers demonstrated the greatest improvements related to loneliness, social connectedness, empathic listening, and flourishing. Peer support specialists demonstrated the greatest improvements related to positive affect, and clinicians demonstrated the greatest improvements related to mindfulness awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Promising evidence indicates that eCPR, a peer-developed and peer-delivered program, may increase feelings of belonging while increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems and improving clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect and feelings of loneliness.","output":"Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Peer-Developed and Virtually Delivered Community Mental Health Training Program (Emotional CPR): Pre-Post Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide and has caused severe health and economic issues on a global scale. By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials.

In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (MCO), or lockdown seems to be the most effective way to curb the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, studies show that lockdowns affect people 's livelihoods and lifestyle, as well as their emotional and mental state. This situation, in many countries, is exacerbated by the onslaught of negative news on Covid-19 and heightened news consumption via various media platforms. Given this, the objective of the current study is to analyse the representation of Covid-19 in Malaysian media based on a corpus of news reports during Malaysia's first lockdown, i.e. MCO 1.0. This was a period of uncertainty lasting six weeks beginning from 18 March 2020 which saw increased reports of mental health cases and domestic violence cases in the country. News reports published in two Malaysian English online newspapers, The Star Online and Malaysiakini during MCO 1.0 formed the corpus of study. Using collocational analysis, the study examined the semantic prosody of Covid-19 and how it is represented in Malaysian new reports. The findings show that 'Covid-19' generally occurs in the company of unfavourable associations, causing it to acquire a negative prosody and in turn negatively represented in the news reports. The unfavourable portrayal of Covid-19, coupled with the increase in news consumption may adversely affect readers' emotions and anxiety levels, which in turn, may contribute to crisis fatigue.","output":"From Positive to Death: A Corpus-Based Semantic Analysis of COVID-19 Representation in Malaysian English News Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues in impending world public health and bringing considerable human suffering.

This study is designed using a qualitative method with an ethnography approach. Using the binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Levi-Strauss, this study conducts the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City. The data analysed using the response pattern of informants. We use the taxonomy analysis and finds three levels of vulnerability group;(a) jobs lost, (b) income decreased, and (c) delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group that obeys self-isolation is a rational thinking model. They stay at home, do not go to work, and no income. Also, the group who ignored self-isolation is a non-rational thinking model. They work, as usual, get their salaries, and believe that Covid-19 is a disaster;they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID 19 brings an economic impact on vulnerable groups in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income. Even its circumstances are worse when self-isolation is forced. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, and livelihood plans by providing access to improve livelihoods sustainably. ? 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent, and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help contain the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved. DESIGN: We developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We applied this model to quantify the impact of different approaches of contact tracing in Austria to derive general conclusions on contract tracing. RESULTS: The study displays that strict tracing complements other intervention strategies. For the containment of the disease, the number of secondary infections must be reduced by about 75%. Implementing the proposed tracing strategy supplements measures worth about 5%. Evaluation of the number of preventively quarantined persons shows that household quarantine is the most effective in terms of avoided cases per quarantined person. LIMITATIONS: The results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained. Therefore, contact tracing must be executed strictly, and adherence within the population must be held up to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks of the disease.","output":"Evaluation of Contact-Tracing Policies against the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria: An Agent-Based Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, behavioural interventions to reduce disease transmission have been central to public health policy worldwide. Sustaining individual protective behaviour is especially important in low-income and middle-income settings, where health systems have fewer resources and access to vaccination is limited.

SETTING: We conducted a panel survey of Indian households to understand how the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviours has changed over time. Our data span peaks and valleys of disease transmission over MayCDecember 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents included 3719 adults from 1766 Indian households enrolled in the Harmonised Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India. ANALYSIS: We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to quantify time trends in protective behaviours. RESULTS: We find a 30.6 percentage point (95% CI (26.7 to 34.5); p<0.01) decline in protective behaviours related to social distancing over the observation period. Mask wearing and handwashing, in contrast, decreased by only 4.3 percentage points (95% CI (0.97 to 7.6); p<0.05) from a high base. Our conclusions are unchanged after adjusting for recorded COVID-19 caseload and nationwide COVID-19 containment policy; we also observe significant declines across socioeconomic strata spanning age, gender, education and urbanicity.

Hence a rapid drug repositioning and lead identification strategy are required to mitigate these outbreaks. We report a pharmacophore and molecular dynamics-based approach for drug repositioning and lead identification against dual targets (3CLp and PLp) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacophore model of 3CLp inhibitors was apolar with two aromatic and two H-bond acceptors, whereas that of PLp was relatively polar, bearing one aromatic and three H-bond acceptors. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening yielded six existing FDA-approved drugs and twelve natural products with both the pharmacophoric features. Among them are nelfinavir, tipranavir and licochalcone-D, which has shown better binding characteristics with both the proteases compared to lopinavir. The molecular dynamics revealed that the connecting loop (residues 176-199) of 3CLp is highly flexible, and hence, inhibitors should avoid high-affinity interactions with it. Lopinavir, due to its high affinity with the loop region, exhibited unstable binding. Further, the van der Waals size of the 3CLp inhibitors positively correlated with their binding affinity with 3CLp. However, the van der Waals size of a ligand should not cross a threshold of 572?3, beyond which the ligands are likely to make high-affinity interaction with the loop and suffer unstable binding as observed in the case of lopinavir. Similarly, the total polar surface area of the ligands were found to be negatively correlated with their binding affinity with PLp.","output":"Dual inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteases: pharmacophore and molecular dynamics based drug repositioning and phytochemical leads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of early versus late third-trimester maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination on transplacental transfer and neonatal levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Anti-RBD-specific IgG concentrations in neonatal sera were higher following early versus late third-trimester vaccination (median 9620 AU/mL (IQR 5131C15332 AU/mL) versus 6697 AU/mL (IQR 3157C14731 AU/mL), p 0.02), and were positively correlated with increasing time since vaccination (r = 0.26; p 0.001). Median antibody placental transfer ratios were increased following early versus late third-trimester immunization (anti-S ratio: 1.3 (IQR 1.1C1.6) versus 0.9 (IQR 0.6C1.1); anti-RBD-specific ratio: 2.3 (IQR 1.7C3.0) versus 0.7 (IQR 0.5C1.2), p <0.001). Neutralizing antibodies placental transfer ratio was greater following early versus late third-trimester immunization (median 1.9 (IQR 1.7C2.5) versus 0.8 (IQR 0.5C1.1), p <0.001), and was positively associated with longer duration from vaccination (r = 0.77; p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early compared with late third-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 immunization enhanced transplacental antibody transfer and increased neonatal neutralizing antibody levels. Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women early in the third trimester may enhance neonatal seroprotection.","output":"Timing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy and transplacental antibody transfer: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines sectoral productivity shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, their aggregate impact, and the possible compensatory effects of improving productivity in infrastructure-related sectors. We employ the KLEMS annual dataset for a group of OECD and Latin America and the Caribbean countries, complemented with high-frequency data for 2020. First, we estimate a panel vector autoregression of growth rates in sector level labor productivity to specify the nature and size of sectoral shocks using the historical data. We then run impulse-response simulations of one standard deviation shocks in the sectors that were most affected by COVID-19. We estimate that the pandemic cut economy-wide labor productivity by 4.9% in Latin America, and by 3.5% for the entire sample. Finally, by modeling the long-run relationship between productivity shocks in the sectors most affected by COVID-19, we find that large productivity improvements in infrastructureequivalent to at least three times the historical rates of productivity gainsmay be needed to fully compensate for the negative productivity losses traceable to COVID-19.

However, it has not been objectively and systematically compared against Illumina short-read sequencers. FINDINGS: By using the same KOREF sample, the Korean Reference Genome, we have compared 7 sequencing platforms including BGISEQ-500, DNBSEQ-T7, HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000, HiSeqX10, and NovaSeq6000. We measured sequencing quality by comparing sequencing statistics (base quality, duplication rate, and random error rate), mapping statistics (mapping rate, depth distribution, and percent GC coverage), and variant statistics (transition/transversion ratio, dbSNP annotation rate, and concordance rate with single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] genotyping chip) across the 7 sequencing platforms. We found that MGI platforms showed a higher concordance rate for SNP genotyping than HiSeq2000 and HiSeq4000. The similarity matrix of variant calls confirmed that the 2 MGI platforms have the most similar characteristics to the HiSeq2500 platform. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MGI and Illumina sequencing platforms showed comparable levels of sequencing quality, uniformity of coverage, percent GC coverage, and variant accuracy; thus we conclude that the MGI platforms can be used for a wide range of genomics research fields at a lower cost than the Illumina platforms.","output":"Comparative analysis of 7 short-read sequencing platforms using the Korean Reference Genome: MGI and Illumina sequencing benchmark for whole-genome sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the main public health challenges currently facing the world. Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"basic reproduction number\\" or \\"R0.\\" The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.381.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic.

PURPOSE: To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from March 27 to April 10, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and salient findings were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: A total of 412 patients (average age, 57 years; range, 18 to >90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. A total of 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n = 137; US, n = 44; CT, n = 42; MRI, n = 1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year of increase; P = .001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 17.3; P < .001). Bowel-wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT images (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR, 15.5; P = .01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT images obtained in patients in the ICU (four of 20). Surgical correlation (n = 4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of the bowel (n = 3) and bowel infarction (n = 2). Pathologic findings revealed ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n = 2). Right upper quadrant US examinations were mostly performed because of liver laboratory findings (87%, 32 of 37), and 54% (20 of 37) revealed a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder, suggestive of bile stasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n = 4) had negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSION: Bowel abnormalities and gallbladder bile stasis were common findings on abdominal images of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Several procedures to reduce COVID transmission have been implemented as services resumed (e.g. COVID testing). Despite this, some patients may still experience what is now called COVID anxiety. The aim of this study was to monitor satisfaction with covid mitigation measures and anxiety among patients attending colonoscopy following an abnormal screening result.MethodsWe surveyed patients who were invited for colonoscopy at St Marks Hospital between July 2020 and May 2021. Data on anxiety and worry were collected, 3 days before and after colonoscopy;scales ranged from 6-24 for general anxiety, 0-20 for COVID-anxiety and 1-4 for bowel cancer worry (with higher scores representing greater anxiety for all three measures). Descriptive statistics were used to assess mean pre- and post-procedure anxiety scores. Inferential statistics were used to test for differences in anxiety, before and after colonoscopy. All analyses were performed using SPSS (Ver 27.0).Results205 patients (mean age 67 years;114 males, 91 females;121 White, 55, South Asian, 27 any other ethnicity;142 English first language speakers) completed the pre-procedure questionnaire and were enrolled into the study. 89 (43.4%) completed the post-procedure questionnaire and were analysed.Pre- procedure, mean general anxiety, COVID-anxiety, and bowel cancer worry scores were 10.94, 0.93 and 1.95, respectively. Post-procedure, the general anxiety, COVID-anxiety and bowel cancer worry scores were 8.92, 1.03 and 2.11, respectively. The change in general anxiety (-2.02) was statistically significant (p=0.015), while the changes in COVID anxiety (+0.1) and bowel cancer worry (+0.16) were not (both ps<0.05).Significant reductions in general anxiety were observed for women (pre- and post-procedure general anxiety scores were: 13.05 vs. 8.33, respectively;p<0.001), White British adults (pre- and post-procedure general anxiety scores were: 11.47 and 8.90, respectively;p<0.001) and adults whose first language was English (pre- and post-procedure general anxiety scores were: 11.49 and 9.08, respectively;p<0.001).The majority of patients were highly satisfied with the covid-measures put in place. There was no association between satisfaction and changes in COVID Anxiety (p<0.05).ConclusionsCOVID anxiety was low among people who attended colonoscopy. General anxiety, however, was moderate, although it was reduced following the procedure. General anxiety was not reduced for some groups, including those whose first language is not English, highlighting the need for further research into factors affecting experience in these groups.","output":"Patient reported anxiety, before and after colonoscopy, during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Virus-infected host cells switch their metabolism to a more glycolytic phenotype, required for new virion synthesis and packaging. Therefore, we investigated the effect and mechanistic action of glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) on virus multiplication in host cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 induced change in glycolysis was examined in Vero E6 cells. Effect of 2-DG on virus multiplication was evaluated by RT-PCR (N and RdRp genes) analysis, protein expression analysis of Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins and visual indication of cytopathy effect (CPE), The mass spectrometry analysis was performed to examine the 2-DG induced change in glycosylation status of receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. KEY FINDINGS: We observed SARS-COV-2 infection induced increased glucose influx and glycolysis, resulting in selectively high accumulation of the fluorescent glucose analog, 2-NBDG in Vero E6 cells. 2-DG inhibited glycolysis, reduced virus multiplication and alleviated cells from virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. The progeny virions produced from 2-DG treated cells were found unglycosylated at crucial N-glycosites (N331 and N343) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein, resulting in production of defective progeny virions with compromised infective potential. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanistic study revealed that the inhibition of SARS-COV-2 multiplication is attributed to 2-DG induced glycolysis inhibition and possibly un-glycosylation of the spike protein, also. Therefore, based on its previous human trials in different types of Cancer and Herpes patients, it could be a potential molecule to study in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose attenuates SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in host cells and weakens the infective potential of progeny virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Claims that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) can improve immune function have increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and may have contributed to the rapid spread of both accurate and inaccurate information (referred to as an infodemic by the World Health Organization). Objective: To identify, appraise, and synthesize the scientific literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes in patients with infectious disease and to examine the association between SMT and selected immunological, endocrine, and other physiological biomarkers. Evidence Review: A literature search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Index to Chiropractic Literature, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase was conducted from inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized clinical trials and cohort studies were included. Eligible studies were critically appraised, and evidence with high and acceptable quality was synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guideline. Findings: A total of 2593 records were retrieved; after exclusions, 50 full-text articles were screened, and 16 articles reporting the findings of 13 studies comprising 795 participants were critically appraised. The literature search found no clinical studies that investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes among patients with infectious disease. Eight articles reporting the results of 6 high- and acceptable-quality RCTs comprising 529 participants investigated the effect of SMT on biomarkers. Spinal manipulative therapy was not associated with changes in lymphocyte levels or physiological markers among patients with low back pain or participants who were asymptomatic compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Spinal manipulative therapy was associated with short-term changes in selected immunological biomarkers among asymptomatic participants compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review of 13 studies, no clinical evidence was found to support or refute claims that SMT was efficacious or effective in changing immune system outcomes. Although there were limited preliminary data from basic scientific studies suggesting that SMT may be associated with short-term changes in immunological and endocrine biomarkers, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Given the lack of evidence that SMT is associated with the prevention of infectious diseases or improvements in immune function, further studies should be completed before claims of efficacy or effectiveness are made.","output":"Assessment of Studies Evaluating Spinal Manipulative Therapy and Infectious Disease and Immune System Outcomes: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing COVID-19 widespread has created the necessity to assess the diagnostic accuracy of newly introduced (RT-PCR based) assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory tract samples.

Fifty-four samples were positive, and 71 were negative with the Allplex? assay, whereas 47 of 54 samples were also positive with the Simplexa? assay. The Quanty assay detected 55 positive samples, including the 54 positive samples with the Allplex? assay and 1 sample that was Allplex? negative but Simplexa? positive. Using a consensus result criterion as the reference standard allowed to resolve the eight samples with discordant results (one Allplex? negative and seven Simplexa? negative) as truly false negative. Interestingly, a Spearmans negative association was found between the viral RNA loads quantified by the Quanty assay and the C(T) values of RT PCRs performed with either the Allplex? assay or the Simplexa? assay. However, the strength of this association was higher for the Allplex? assay (N gene,  = ? 0.92; RdRP gene,  = ? 0.91) than for the Simplexa? assay (ORF1ab gene,  = ? 0.65; S gene,  = ? 0.80).

STUDY DESIGN: This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. RESULTS: Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as mean  standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39  18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32  6.70 days), and laboratory indicators.

METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery. For confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.","output":"Risks of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Pregnancy; a Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo/Objetivo A administrao de vacinas contra o SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavrus 2) se mostrou como uma das principais aes no combate e preveno da COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019).

The potential for cross transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and urine has led global healthcare providers to examine different infection prevention and control practices not least the management and disposal of human excreta.

The other is use of disposable system; either with pulp bedpans and urinals disposed of in a macerator or hygienic bags disposed of as waste. A review of the literature provided limited evidence to explore these different methods; both having pros and cons with regards to the environmental aspects as well as the infection prevention and control implications. Manual cleaning can pose associated infection risks to both staff and patients. Disinfection of re-usable bedpans may not achieve the level of disinfection required.

IL6-mediated activation of STAT3 proliferates proinflammatory responses that lead to cytokine storm promotion. Thus, STAT3 inhibitors may play a crucial role in managing the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The present study discusses a method for predicting inhibitors against the STAT3 signaling pathway. METHOD: The main dataset comprises 1565 STAT3 inhibitors and 1671 non-inhibitors used for training, testing, and evaluation of models. A number of machine learning classifiers have been implemented to develop the models. RESULTS: The outcomes of the data analysis show that rings and aromatic groups are significantly abundant in STAT3 inhibitors compared to non-inhibitors. First, we developed models using 2-D and 3-D chemical descriptors and achieved a maximum AUC of 0.84 and 0.73, respectively. Second, fingerprints are used to build predictive models and achieved 0.86 AUC with an accuracy of 78.70% on the validation dataset. Finally, models were developed using hybrid descriptors, which achieved a maximum of 0.87 AUC with 78.55% accuracy on the validation dataset. CONCLUSION: We used the best model to identify STAT3 inhibitors in FDA-approved drugs and found few drugs (e.g., Tamoxifen and Perindopril) to manage the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO2 and PaCO2, pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (4:1) to receive 2 U of convalescent plasma versus standard plasma. Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were measured in plasma units and in trial recipients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Enrollment was terminated after emergency use authorization was granted for convalescent plasma. Seventy-four patients were randomized. At baseline, mean (sd) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.4 [5.6] and 22.5 [6.6]), percent of patients intubated (19% and 20%), and median (interquartile range) days from symptom onset to randomization of 9 (6-18) and 9 (6-15), were similar in the convalescent plasma versus standard plasma arms, respectively. Convalescent plasma had high neutralizing activity (median [interquartile range] titer 1:526 [1:359-1:786]) and its administration increased antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 14.4%, whereas standard plasma administration led to an 8.6% decrease (p = 0.005).

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people.

FC was estimated using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression. The COVID group demonstrated significantly enhanced FC in regions from the Occipital and Parietal Lobes, comparing to the HC group. On the other hand, the COVID group exhibited significantly reduced FC in several vermal layers of the cerebellum. More importantly, we noticed negative correlation of FC with self-reported fatigue within regions from the Parietal lobe, which are known to be associated with fatigue.","output":"Assessing functional connectivity differences and work-related fatigue in surviving COVID-negative patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens, Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus, MHV infecting Mus musculus, HEV infecting Sus scrofa, and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U. Evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.","output":"Coronavirus genomes carry the signatures of their habitats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Lower extremity injury (LEI) is highly prevalent and its occurrence increases the risk of future injury in athletic populations. Identifying athletes at risk of injury is the key to target injury-prevention programmes. Functional performance tests (FPT) assess an athlete's ability to produce and accept forces during movement tasks reflective of those experienced in sport, and are used to identify deficits in physical qualities or neuromuscular control. This review aims to identify FPT which have potential to predict LEI and assess their measurement properties associated with reliability, validity, responsiveness and practicability (interpretability and feasibility). METHODS/ANALYSIS This protocol will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments Methodology. The search strategy has two stages: stage 1 will identify lower limb FPT used in athletic populations; and stage 2 will assess the measurement properties of the identified FPT. A sensitive search strategy will use MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and SPORTdiscus databases; from inception to June 2020. Hand searching reference lists, key journals and grey literature will be completed. One reviewer will complete search 1 and data extraction. Two reviewers will complete the search, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment for search 2. Evidence will be pooled or summarised by individual measurement property by each individual study and grouped by FPT. Meta-analysis using a random effects model with subgroup analysis will be performed where possible. Pooled or summarised results for each FPT in relation to each measurement property will be rated against the criteria for good measurement properties. Two reviewers will assess the overall body of evidence per measurement property per FPT using the modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. This review will enable clinicians to make an informed choice when selecting FPT. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required for this review and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and submitted for conference presentation.

This study begins by describing how screening for disease has historically been performed. It proposes four measurement characteristics of an ideal screening solution: non-contact, effective, rapid and low-cost measurements. Next, it reviews the existing literature on fever-screening using non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT) devices as well as infrared thermography (IRT) devices, as these are two technologies which have experienced increasing use. For this review, 185 research papers were identified, 21 research studies were included after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A total of 35 experiments were identified for analysis and their results tabulated. Of these studies, 66% are IRT and 34% are NCIT, with a median sample size of 430 subjects. 26 experiments involve febrile participants, with a median febrile percentage of 11.22 % of population. The reported sensitivity of febrile detection using NCIT varies from 3.7% to 97% and when using IRT it varies from 15% to 100%. Both indoor and outdoor studies are investigated, as well as those conducted in acute and non-acute settings. The results of this review show a clear lack of consensus on the effectiveness of these systems. Overall, these results indicate that sensitivity and specificity are reduced when using IRT and NCIT technologies compared to other thermometers used in medical practice. Their use should be carefully assessed based on the risks present in each particular measurement scenario.

Although the majority of meningiomas are benign and slow-progressing, the tumors that grow to a larger size are associated with various risks during surgical procedures. Early detection of meningiomas is crucial to the treatment as those detected early can be treated through non-invasive methods. Due to their benign nature, meningiomas contain homogeneous protein biomarkers that can be easily identified. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a high protein composition which can be used to diagnose various brain tumors. Because CSF comes into direct contact with the brain during its functioning, it is one of the factors that makes it an important source of different biomarkers. An analysis of biochemical changes occurring in the CSF can be useful in assessing the condition of the periventricular white matter and the parenchyma. In this review, PubMed, Medline, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were used to identify studies discussing meningiomas regarding their assessment, types, diagnosis, and treatment, with more attention directed towards the application of CSF proteome analysis in diagnosis. Priority was given to studies published within the last 15 years. The following keywords were used in the literature search: cerebrospinal fluid, meningiomas, brain tumors, primary brain tumors, protein biomarkers, proteome analysis, and diagnosis. Subsequently, the 15 most relevant studies were selected for inclusion in the review. We excluded studies discussing different types of non-brain tumors as well as older articles. The selected studies also underwent a quality appraisal process using corresponding assessment tools. The selected articles were highly informative about meningiomas and the processes of diagnosis and treatment that are currently in use as well as those that are being developed or implemented. The use of CSF proteins in the diagnostic process is also discussed in this review. The studies also describe proteomics as a less invasive procedure that allows for the analysis of entire proteins and the projection of diagnostic images with higher resolutions that aid in the diagnosis.","output":"Utilization of Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Analysis in the Diagnosis of Meningioma: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU At the third stage, as a result of classification (method - decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies ?

In consequence, most governments have taken action to promote access to water and sanitation services for all. This paper documents an overview of initiatives and interventions that countries have implemented during the first months of the COVID-19 response. Initiatives have been identified across 84 countries worldwide, and categorized into those that aimed at securing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for all, and those that sought to provide technical and financial support to service providers. The pandemic has not hit countries in the same way. Accordingly, results show disparities in the response between and within regions, with the level of activity found in the countries varying largely in terms of ambition and scope. Hygiene promotion and infection prevention and control (IPC) has been widely adopted C at least one response measure found in 94% of mapped countries -, although not always matched in ambition with the assured availability of soap, water, and handwashing facilities. Support to vulnerable households to promote basic access to WASH services at scale was weak (38% of countries) or implemented locally (25%), and requiring additional focus, particularly in rural areas and small towns. In addition, parallel support needs to be extended to service providers or to households themselves in the form of cash transfers, in order to ensure the financial viability and the continuity of services. All lessons learned distilled from the pandemic should help strengthen the enabling environment for more resilient services in future emergencies. Areas for focus could include developing specific pandemic response strategies and plans; strengthening coordination; and establishing emergency financial support mechanisms for water operators, for example.

Treatment escalation plans were made in collaboration with the psychiatric team who knew the patients well, together with the expertise of acute medicine in the context of support from the palliative care service should the MHT need to care for those at end-of-life.","output":"A collaborative initiative to provide support to a Mental Health Unit during a COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of people and the global economy. Tourism has been one the most affected economic sectors because of the mobility restrictions established by governments and uncoordinated actions from origin and destination regions. The coordination of restrictions and reopening policies could help control the spread of virus and enhance economies, but this is not an easy endeavor since touristic companies, citizens, and local governments have conflicting interests. We propose an evolutionary game model that reflects a collective risk dilemma behind these decisions. To this aim, we represent regions as players, organized in groups; and consider the perceived risk as a strict lock-down and null economic activity. The costs for regions when restricting their mobility are heterogeneous, given that the dependence on tourism of each region is diverse. Our analysis shows that, for both large populations and the EU NUTS2 case study, the existence of heterogeneous costs enhances global agreements. Furthermore, the decision on how to group regions to maximize the regions' agreement of the population is a relevant issue for decision makers to consider. We find out that a layout of groups based on similar costs of cooperation boosts the regions' agreements and avoid the risk of having a total lock-down and a negligible tourism activity. These findings can guide policy makers to facilitate agreements among regions to maximize the tourism recovery.","output":"A collective risk dilemma for tourism restrictions under the COVID-19 context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid 19 pandemic radically changed our lives worldwide in 2020. Control of the pandemic required public health interventions which included social distancing and the minimising social gatherings. The implementation of these measures resulted in major changes in the delivery of healthcare education. Aim: This observational study reports on the undergraduate experience of the transition of the obstetrics and gynaecology programme from a traditional face-to-face approach to a blended learning programme (BLP) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Changes to the undergraduate Obstetrics and Gynaecology programme in response to the pandemic are described. These changes were implemented with no additional funding or resources. On completion of the module, students voluntarily completed an anonymous survey on their experience of the BLP. Results: Of the 80 students who completed the module, 81% responded. Overall satisfaction with the module was high with median scores for all online and clinical components of the module ranging from 8 - 10. The students expressed high levels of satisfaction with the support they received from their teachers, hospital staff and patients. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this paper is the first to describe the transition of the entire undergraduate module in Obstetrics and Gynaecology to a BLP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction scores submitted anonymously were high. Whether this will be maintained post pandemic remains unknown but the positive response to the BLP provides direction as to what elements of the revised programme may be worth developing further in the future.","output":"The undergraduate experience of the transition of the obstetrics and gynaecology programme to blended learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumothorax in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) often presents as a difficult-to-treat disease.

Surgical options for ESA are often limited to esophagectomy for management of severe dysphagia or life-threatening aspiration episodes. Mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (MATHE) by a small left neck incision combined with an abdominal incision, without using a transthoracic approach, has been reported to reduce pulmonary complications. We herein present the first report of MATHE in 2 consecutive patients with ESA and gastric bypass. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between August 2017 and September 2020, 2 patients who had undergone Heller myotomy and Roux en Y gastric bypass underwent MATHE for ESA. Transhiatal esophagectomy with mediastinoscopy-assisted dissection was performed. The remnant stomach was used as the conduit in both cases. The embedded Supplemental Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/SLE/A269) reports our novel technique. RESULTS Both cases were completed laparoscopically without conversion to laparotomy or thoracotomy. Median length of hospital stay was 9 days (range, 6 to 11 d). Postoperatively, 1 patient developed a cervical anastomotic leak, which healed with conservative management. No other major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS MATHE can be safely performed in patients with a history of gastric bypass and ESA without requiring thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus. Further studies are required to validate reproducibility of our technique as an alternative to using a thoracic incision.","output":"Mediastinoscopy-assisted Transhiatal Esophagectomy (MATHE) in End-stage Achalasia and Gastric Bypass: Technique and Early Results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study described the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and pointed out the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes.

Our objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOC relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. MethodsWe analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors (summarized in three measures: 1. strength of public health countermeasures: stringency index, 2. how much people moved about outside their homes: mobility index, and 3. vaccine intervention: proportion of Canadian population fully vaccinated). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), the provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index and full vaccine coverage. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOC (Alpha, or B.1.1.7, Beta, or B.1.351, Gamma, or P.1, and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) between the clusters. ResultsThree clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures were identified. Cluster 1 consisted of the three Canadian territories, and characterized by higher degree of vaccine deployment and lesser degree of countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and Atlantic region) was typified by lesser implementation of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster was formed by provinces in the Pacific region, Central Canada, and Prairie region, with moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalence were significantly different across the clusters.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou from January 21st to February 24th 2020 were enrolled. According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.213.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027). Abnormal ECG was found in 39 of 42 patients with ECG examination. Nonspecific change of T wave was the most common.

Since then, Omicron VOC displaced Delta one in almost every country. Venezuela implemented in May 2021 molecular testing of all the passengers arriving at Venezuelan airports. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the presence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in those positive samples, by sequencing a small fragment of the Spike genomic region. RESULTS: The Omicron variant was found in passengers arriving to Venezuela from the beginning of December. Complete genome analysis confirmed the presence of the Omicron VOC. The detection of this VOC coincided with an unprecedented increase in the frequency of passengers with positive nucleic acid testing.

The novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2 Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools. Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited highest binding affinity -8.2 Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties.

Despite this, widespread technological accessibility and ease-of-use make virtual research a viable alternative. Studies conducted virtually offer researchers and participants flexibility, convenience, and geographic accessibility. However, there are inherent challenges that may influence the research process, particularly for participants. This study examines patients' challenges with participating in a virtual research interview from the perspectives of researchers and patients. Methods: We conducted an exploratory community-based sub-study during a concurrent study to validate a function-based health literacy measurement tool (questionnaire) with chronic airway disease patients. Participants received and accessed study materials virtually and responded to the questionnaire over-the-phone;some participants were re-tested for questionnaire reproducibility. Initially, participants and researchers independently responded to 6 open-ended questions post-interview regarding challenges experienced during the study. Responses informed the development of a comprehensive, 18-question checklist addressing participant challenges. In subsequent interviews, research assistants administered the checklist, capturing quantitative data and verbatim quotes. Researchers' observation notes, recorded during each interview, and team teleconference notes were reviewed to provide researchers' perspectives on participant challenges. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was conducted using NVivo (QSR International, Version 12). Challenges were coded inductively and quantified on the basis of whether a researcher or patient had indicated a patient challenge, and cross-referenced with detailed observation notes. Quantitative analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2019). Results: Initial interviews (n=185) and re-tests (n=110) were analysed. Quantified challenges were compared across self-reported gender, condition (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) & asthma-COPD overlap (ACO)), education level, first language, age, ethnicity, disease duration, and previous disease-specific education. In 76% of interviews, participants experienced one or more challenges;31 unique challenges were identified. As an example, Table 1 contains the top 5 problems experienced by participants, across disease and self-reported gender, during initial interviews recorded using the open-ended question set. Qualitative analysis revealed that participants primarily experienced challenges with technology, communication (verbal & online), and instruction clarity (e.g., when/how to use study materials). Conclusions: Participants experienced a variety of challenges throughout the virtual study. Considering potential friction points for participants and possible solutions prior to starting the study by involving researchers, key informants, and participants can enhance the study process. Developing simple, informative study materials and instructions may help to mitigate challenges inherent to virtual research and facilitate a seamless, participant-friendly study experience given the unfamiliarity of this research format. .","output":"Chronic airway disease patients' challenges during a virtual study: Insights from participants & researchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus appeared in December of 2019 resulting in a world-wide pandemic, science has been trying to keep up with how to accurately identify symptoms, diagnose, and treat the novel infection. It was evident that infection resulted in upper respiratory tract symptoms, with the lungs being most commonly affected1. Clinicians have been scrambling to identify radiographic findings that could predict infection with the virus. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest has become the modality of choice. Ground glass opacities (GGO) are identified in a large majority of cases but other radiographic changes such as laterality, consolidation, lobe involvement, and vascular abnormalities also give signal to COVID-19.

She developed progressively worsening hypoxemia and dyspnea prompting a chest CT scan that was negative for pulmonary embolism, but GGO were noted in the right upper and lower lobes with a crazy-paving appearance. Remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma was administered. She improved and was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Discussion: Crazypaving can be seen in many conditions - most commonly pulmonary edema, infection, hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, radiation pneumonitis and eosinophilic pneumonia3. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses found crazy-paving in 34.9% of CT scans of the chest in patients with COVID-192. This case highlights crazy-paving as a radiographic finding on CT scan of the chest. Conclusion: It is evident that as more data accumulates about radiographic findings and treatment of COVID-19, that COVID- 19 does not have pathognomonic radiological findings.","output":"Crazy-paving as a radiological finding of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: With the sudden onset and global dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many nations including Canada attempted to reduce spread of the resultant COVID-19 syndrome with self-isolation and quarantine, while seeking a cure or vaccine for this disease. Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. Methods: The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. Results: 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-hoc analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Demographic Predictors of Self-Isolation or Self-Quarantine and Impact of Isolation and Quarantine on Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use prior to hospitalization on clinical outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Design: An observational retrospective cohort study from 178 hospitals from a large health system across the United States. Patient population: Hospitalized patients (n=2726) with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Outcomes during hospitalization, including disease severity by level of care, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilator (MV) use, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital death. Patient demographics and comorbidities were also recorded. Results: A total of 2,726 patients were included in the analysis. Three hundred ninety-eight (14.6%) patients were taking an ACEI, while 352 (12.9%) patients were taking an ARB prior to hospitalization. After adjusting for comorbidities, age, renal function, and severity of illness based on level of care, ACEI prior to admission was independently associated with decreased need for MV (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, p value 0.003) and mortality (OR 0.45, p value <0.001). Similarly, patients who took ARBs were less likely to require MV when compared to the non-renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (RAASb) group (7.4% vs 12.2%, p value 0.009, respectively). ARB prior to admission was also independently associated with decreased need for MV (OR 0.46, p value 0.001) and mortality (OR 0.66, p value 0.017) compared to the non-RAASb group.

As no such studies have been carried out in Spain, our objective is to describe and quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients in Spanish hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, nationwide study collected information from hospital departments treating oncology patients. An electronic questionnaire comparing outcomes and management of oncohematological patients for the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods was used. RESULTS: Information from 78 departments (36 tertiary hospitals) was analyzed. Forty-four departments implemented adapted protocols during March 2020. Most of these (n = 38/44; 86.4%) carried out COVID-19 triage, while 26 of 44 (59.1%) carried out onsite polymerase chain reaction tests for clinically suspected cases. A shift from in-person to telephone visits was observed in 43 of 44 (97.7%) departments. Comparing the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods, the number of new patients decreased by 20.8% (from 160.2 to 126.4). Decreases were also seen in the mean number of total (2858.2 versus 1686.1) and cancer (465.5 versus 367.2) biopsies, as well as the mean number of bone marrow biopsies (30.5 versus 18.6). Concerning the number of patients visiting specific cancer care departments, a decrease from 2019 to 2020 was seen for mean number of chemotherapy treatments (712.7 versus 643.8) and radiation therapy (2169.9 versus 2139.9). Finally, a reduction from 2019 to 2020 of 12.9% (from 8.6 to 7.4) in the mean number of patients included in clinical trials was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care in Spain. The pandemic caused a 20.8% decrease in newly diagnosed patients, which may impact future outcomes.

Cardiovascular adverse effects of antipsychotic medications are well known, and include changes in blood pressure and arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death worldwide, and antipsychotic medications are associated with numerous cardiac side effects. A possible link exists between antipsychotic medications and sudden cardiac death. Common prescribing patterns that may influence cardiovascular events include the use of multiple antipsychotics and/or additional drugs commonly prescribed to patients on antipsychotics. The results of this review reflect an association between antipsychotic drugs and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death by iatrogenic prolongation of the QTc interval. QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death exist in patients taking antipsychotic monotherapy. The risk increases for the concomitant use of specific drugs that prolong the QTc interval, such as opioids, antibiotics, and illicit drugs. However, evidence suggests that QTc intervals may not adequately predict sudden cardiac death. In considering the findings of this narrative review, we conclude that it is unclear whether there is a precise association between antipsychotic polypharmacy and sudden cardiac death with QTc interval changes. The present narrative review warrants further research on this important potential association.","output":"Antipsychotic Polypharmacy-Related Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality: A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starting in early 2020, there has been much interest in the applicability of radiologic imaging in managing affected patients From the initial screening to addressing the extent of pulmonary involvement, CT scans provide great value to hospitals overwhelmed by an influx of patients, including those with suspected COVID-19 Because CTs come at a high financial cost, lower cost real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 tests are critical due to their ability to identify asymptomatic carriers and properly handle patients during the ongoing pandemic However, unlike RT-PCR, CT scans can also provide insight into the progression of the virus The signs of acute COVID-19 infection include unique patterns of ground-glass opacities (GGO) with vascular thickening, enabling radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 with a high specificity Additionally, there may be a significant value in the use of CT scans in predicting the outcomes","output":"The Role of Computed Tomography and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in the Diagnosis and Prognostication of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spanned the globe.

OBJECTIVE: Our scoping review aimed to elucidate the ways in which social media use among adolescent peers influences eating behaviors. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature of articles published from journal inception to 2019 was performed by searching PubMed (ie, MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and other databases. The review was conducted in three steps: (1) identification of the research question and clarification of criteria using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) framework; (2) selection of articles from the literature using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines; and (3) charting and summarizing information from selected articles. PubMeds Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Embases Emtree subject headings were reviewed along with specific keywords to construct a comprehensive search strategy. Subject headings and keywords were based on adolescent age groups, social media platforms, and eating behaviors. After screening 1387 peer-reviewed articles, 37 articles were assessed for eligibility. Participant age, gender, study location, social media channels utilized, user volume, and content themes related to findings were extracted from the articles. RESULTS: Six articles met the final inclusion criteria. A final sample size of 1225 adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Brazil, and Australia were included in controlled and qualitative studies. Instagram and Facebook were among the most popular social media platforms that influenced healthful eating behaviors (ie, fruit and vegetable intake) as well as unhealthful eating behaviors related to fast food advertising. Online forums served as accessible channels for eating disorder relapse prevention among youth. Social media influence converged around four central themes: (1) visual appeal, (2) content dissemination, (3) socialized digital connections, and (4) adolescent marketer influencers. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent peer influence in social media environments spans the spectrum of healthy eating (ie, pathological) to eating disorders (ie, nonpathological).

Track and field is a popular competitive youth sport with injuries estimated at 0.84 per 1000 athlete exposures among high school athletes. Injury patterns have been noted to vary by age and differ from those sustained in adult runners. Prior work has examined the epidemiology of youth track and field and running related injuries, but data from the recent decade in the setting of increasing sport specialization and year-round participation is lacking. PURPOSE: To examine the evolving epidemiology of track and field and running related injuries prompting emergency department presentation. METHODS: A retrospective review of data obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database was performed identifying children 10-18 with injuries associated with the Track & Field/Running product code (5030) from 2008-2020. National injury estimates were calculated annually and overall. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize injury characteristics of the entire cohort. Annual injury estimates were calculated to identify trends over the study period, which included the 2020 season interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We identified 8,399 track and field associated NEISS cases occurring from 2008-2020 representing a national estimate of 271,788 injuries [95% Confidence Interval: 250,288 to 294,24]. The majority (52%) of injuries occurred among patients 15 to 18 years of age. Injuries occurred most frequently in the lower extremity (52%) and most commonly involved the ankle (17%) and knee (15%). Sprain/strains were the most frequent injury type (40%). The majority of patients (97%) did not require hospitalization. Injury estimates of each demographic and injury characteristic with 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 1. There was a rising annual frequency of track and field injuries seen peaking in 2017 with a notable decline in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Track and field injuries requiring emergency department presentation appear to be increasing from prior study estimates, but demonstrate similar distribution of injury characteristics. Severe injuries requiring hospitalization remain rare. The majority of injuries involve the knee and ankle and involve older adolescents. This data provides meaningful data for providers caring for and counseling adolescent athletes.","output":"Track and Field Injuries in Children and Adolescents Presenting to us Emergency Departments-An Updated Review of the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 global pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis.

This allows for insights into the likely challenges and support for loss and grief in facing unprecedented disruption and uncertainty. Ultimately, it explores avenues for the priorities to inform better bereavement support. Methods: By examining trusted media data and carefully selected academic literature, we analyse both individual and societal responses to loss and grief in the novel context of the first-wave of COVID-19 in the UK. The discussion relocates the ideas of good and bad deaths in the context of increased social constrains and inequalities. Further, two pairs of contrasting hypotheses are proposed to examine how the UK's first-wave outbreak has shaped policy and practical structures and how these have further impacted experiences of loss and grief both at an individual and collective level. Findings: The discussion captures a mixed picture of loss and grief in the UK, which highlights the importance of timely, holistic, and continuous support both in social policy and care provision. It is found that individuals and collectives express diverse needs in response to deaths and losses as a process of meaning-making. Further, the significance of socio-cultural environments also become evident. These findings highlight community support during the outbreak and further promote a grief literate culture as imperative to support individual and collective needs when confronted with loss and grief. Conclusion: This article provides a timely and comprehensive account of possible challenges and support both for individual and collective experiences of loss and grief at a time of unprecedented social restrictions and mass deaths in the UK.

The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37  10-3 and 2.19  10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this study about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence.

METHODS: This study used a mixed-method approach. The first phase implemented a survey that targeted both academic staff and students to evaluate their experiences with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a focus group discussion was conducted to explore, in-depth, their experience. The survey consisted of five domains as follows: readiness for the shift to distance education during the full and partial lockdown, perception towards distance education, barriers against distance education, and the acquisitions due to distance education. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess participants responses to the different domains (mean score  standard deviation). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the academic staff and 65% of the students responded to the survey. Participants views were positive for readiness for the shift to distance education during the full lockdown (3.890.42 for academic staff and 3.820.50 for students) with almost similar evaluation for the readiness during the blended learning period (3.910.44 for staff and 3.830.59 for students). The findings showed a generally positive perception towards distance education (3.59 0.67 for academic staff and 3.470.64 for students).

Apart from at least 6 M deaths, hundreds of millions have been infected and a much greater number have been plunged into poverty. Vaccines have been effective but financial and logistical challenges have hampered their rapid global deployment. Vaccine disparities have allowed the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants including delta and omicron, perpetuating the pandemic. AREAS COVERED: The immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 is now better understood. Many of the clinical manifestations of severe disease are a consequence of immune dysregulation triggered by the virus. This may explain the lack of efficacy of antiviral treatments, such as convalescent plasma infusions, given later in the disease. EXPERT OPINION: T cells play a crucial role in both the outcome of COVID-19 as well as the protective response to vaccines. Vaccines do not prevent infection but reduce the risk of a chaotic and destructive cellular immune response to the virus. Severe COVID-19 should be considered a virus-induced secondary immune dysregulatory disorder of cellular immunity, with broad host susceptibility. This perspective of COVID-19 will lead to better diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutic strategies in the future.","output":"Severe COVID-19 is a T cell immune dysregulatory disorder triggered by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the susceptibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) in patients with autoimmune conditions treated with antimalarials in a population\\\\based study.

Other approaches related to the RAS pathway might be considered, for example, inhalational administration of ACEIs/ARBs (to deliver drugs directly to the lungs) and use of compounds with other actions (e.g., activation of ACE2, agonism of MAS1 receptors, ?-arrestin-based Angiotensin receptor agonists, and administration of soluble ACE2 or ACE2 peptides). Studies with animal models could test such approaches and assess therapeutic benefit.

Physiological, pharmacological, and clinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key mediator of HF progression. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which, by virtue of its actions on the Mas receptor, opposes the molecular and cellular effects of angiotensin II. ACE2 is widely expressed in cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts, and coronary endothelial cells. Recent preclinical translational studies confirmed a critical counter-regulatory role of ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis on the activated renin-angiotensin system that results in HF with preserved ejection fraction. Although loss of ACE2 enhances susceptibility to HF, increasing ACE2 level prevents and reverses the HF phenotype. ACE2 and Ang 1-7 have emerged as a key protective pathway against HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Recombinant human ACE2 has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials without adverse effects while lowering and increasing plasma angiotensin II and Ang 1-7 levels, respectively. This review discusses the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of ACE2 and the role of the ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis in cardiac physiology and in the pathophysiology of HF. The pharmacological and therapeutic potential of enhancing ACE2/Ang 1-7 action as a novel therapy for HF is highlighted.","output":"Role of the ACE2/Angiotensin 1-7 Axis of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Heart Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature in race, ethnicity, and politics has assessed how minority linked fate, defined as the idea that ethnoracial minorities might share a sense of commonality that extends beyond their particular ethnoracial group to other ethnoracial groups (Gershon et al., in Politics Groups Identities 7(3):642C653, 2019), shapes attitudes toward descriptive representation and support for coalition building. However, scholarship has yet to examine the influence of minority linked fate on political participation. We argue that similar to those who view the interests of co-ethnics as a proxy for their individual interests, Latina/os, Asian Americans, and African Americans who express linked fate with a more expansive minority community are more likely to take political action. This political participation results from senses of obligation to and solidarity with other racial minorities outside of their own.

First unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death data are independent of the fatality rate.

Seeking medical care for children has been described as an important measure of reducing mortality occasioned by morbidity. This study examined factors influencing mothers' health seeking behaviour for their children in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS This study made use of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study involved 75,982 children who received or did not receive measles vaccine and 93,142 children who sought or did not seek medical care when affected by fever or cough and diarrhoea. Binary logistic regression was applied in the analysis. RESULTS Most of the children (74%) received measles vaccine while less than one-fifth sought medical care for fever or cough (16%) and diarrhoea (10%). Majority of the children of women who received measles vaccine and sought medical care when they had fever or cough are from richest households. Children of women with primary and secondary or higher education, children of working women and children of women that attended antenatal care during pregnancy are more likely to seek medical care for fever or cough. While children of women who live in urban areas and children of second or higher order of birth are less likely to receive measles vaccine, children aged 24-35 months and those who were of average size at birth are less likely to seek medical care for diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS This study has revealed that mothers' health care seeking behaviour for their children is influenced by social, maternal and child factors.

This paper investigates the differences in the level of income and expenditure between chronically-ill people and non-chronic population. Data were gathered from a national level survey conducted namely, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka. These data were statistically analysed with one-way and two-way ANOVA, to identify the factors that cause the differences among different groups. For the first time, this study makes an attempt using survey data, to examine the differences in the level of income and expenditure among chronically-ill people in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity (being unemployed due to the disability associated with the respective chronic illness), in the age category of 40C65, having an educational level of tertiary education or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. If workforce population is compelled to lose jobs, it can lead to income insecurity and impair their quality of lives. Under above findings, it is reasonable to assume that most health care expenses are out of pocket. Furthermore, the study infers that chronic illnesses have a statistically proven significant differences towards the income and expenditure level. This has caused due to the interaction of demographic and socio-economic characteristics associated with chronic illnesses.

The risk of this occurring depends on a range of factors, such as the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of local surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, presymptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to here as nonsymptomatic) transmission can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. In this study, using COVID-19 as a case-study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when nonsymptomatic transmission can occur. Methods We construct a branching process model that includes nonsymptomatic transmission, and explore the effects of interventions targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. Specifically, we consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. Findings Seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.

This study sought to compare and assess the diagnostic performance of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and Light Microscopy (LM) with photo-induced electron transfer polymerase chain reaction (PET-PCR) as the gold standard using 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) data across Zambia to better understand diagnostic accuracy metrics and how these vary across a transmission gradient. METHODS: Cross-sectional samples collected in a nationally representative survey from 7 provinces in Zambia were tested for the presence of malaria parasites by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the gold standard PET-PCR. Diagnostic performance was assessed including sensitivity, specificity, negative- and positive-predictive values across a wide malaria transmission spectrum. Diagnostic accuracy metrics were measured, and statistically significant differences were calculated between test methods for different outcome variables. RESULTS: From the individuals included in the MIS, the overall prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria was 32.9% by RDT, 19.4% by LM, and 23.2% by PET-PCR. Herein, RDT and LM diagnostic performance was compared against gold standard PET-PCR with LM displaying a higher diagnostic accuracy than RDTs (91.3% vs. 84.6% respectively) across the transmission spectrum in Zambia. However, the performance of both diagnostics was significantly reduced in low parasitaemia samples. Consistent with previous studies, RDT diagnostic accuracy was predominantly affected by a high rate of false positives. CONCLUSIONS: RDTs and LM both perform well across a range of transmission intensities within their respective target applications, i.e., in the community, for the former, where ease of use and speed of result is critical, and at the health facility, for the latter, where accuracy is prioritized. However, the performance of both diagnostic methods is adversely affected by low parasitaemia infections. As Zambia moves towards elimination more sensitive tools may be required to identify the last cases.

The mechanism by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency causes congenital heart disease remains unknown. To better understand molecular processes by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency perturbs cardiac development, we introduced NAA15 variants into human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and assessed the consequences of these mutations on RNA and protein expression. OBJECTIVE: We aim to understand the role of NAA15 haploinsufficiency in cardiac development by investigating proteomic effects on NatA complex activity and identifying proteins dependent upon a full amount of NAA15. METHODS AND RESULTS: We introduced heterozygous loss of function, compound heterozygous, and missense residues (R276W) in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9. Haploinsufficient NAA15 iPSCs differentiate into cardiomyocytes, unlike NAA15-null iPSCs, presumably due to altered composition of NatA. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal 80% of identified iPSC NatA targeted proteins displayed partial or complete N-terminal acetylation. Between null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells, N-terminal acetylation levels of 32 and 9 NatA-specific targeted proteins were reduced, respectively. Similar acetylation loss in few proteins occurred in NAA15 R276W induced pluripotent stem cells. In addition, steady-state protein levels of 562 proteins were altered in both null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells; 18 were ribosomal-associated proteins. At least 4 proteins were encoded by genes known to cause autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: These studies define a set of human proteins that requires a full NAA15 complement for normal synthesis and development. A 50% reduction in the amount of NAA15 alters levels of at least 562 proteins and N-terminal acetylation of only 9 proteins. One or more modulated proteins are likely responsible for NAA15-haploinsufficiency mediated congenital heart disease. Additionally, genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells provide a platform for evaluating the consequences of amino acid sequence variants of unknown significance on NAA15 function.","output":"Mechanisms of Congenital Heart Disease Caused by NAA15 Haploinsufficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance, and, in a broader perspective, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), continues to evolve and spread beyond all boundaries. As a result, infectious diseases have become more challenging or even impossible to treat, leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality. Despite the failure of conventional, traditional antimicrobial therapy, in the past two decades, no novel class of antibiotics has been introduced. Consequently, several novel alternative strategies to combat these (multi-) drug-resistant infectious microorganisms have been identified. The purpose of this review is to gather and consider the strategies that are being applied or proposed as potential alternatives to traditional antibiotics. These strategies include combination therapy, techniques that target the enzymes or proteins responsible for antimicrobial resistance, resistant bacteria, drug delivery systems, physicochemical methods, and unconventional techniques, including the CRISPR-Cas system.

The puncture point was located 0.5-1.0 cm below the lateral one-third of the clavicle. The efficacy and safety of the NS-guided BPB were evaluated using an injection of 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine in 16 live animals; saline injection was used as a control. Both sides of the brachial plexus were located successfully using the NS-guided technique. Sensory blockade (nociception assessment) and motor blockade (grasping and straightening tests) appeared after application of the two classical local anesthetics, but not normal saline. The motor and sensory blockade induced by bupivacaine exhibited a longer duration than that induced by lidocaine ( p < 0.05). All rats recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia and BPB. No abnormal results were found in pathological studies or behavioral observations. Thus, a rat model of NS-guided BPB was established, and BPB induced an overall reversible sensory and motor blockade in the thoracic limbs.

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19 where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured global anti-NET activity in 171 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of approximately 40% and 50% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM, with high anti-NET antibody levels in general associating with circulating markers of NETs such as myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and calprotectin. Clinically, anti-NET antibodies tracked with impaired oxygenation efficiency and elevated levels of circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had higher levels of anti-NET antibodies than those who did not require oxygen supplementation. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies of the IgG isotype impaired the ability of DNases in healthy serum to degrade NETs. In summary, these data reveal high levels of anti-NET antibodies in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, where they likely impair NET clearance and thereby potentiate SARS-CoV-2 mediated thromboinflammation.","output":"Autoantibodies stabilize neutrophil extracellular traps in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a simple yet effective embedding model to learn quaternion embeddings for entities and relations in knowledge graphs.

However, details on the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on immunological function are relatively lacking. We designed this study to examine the effects of TEAS on the immunological function of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during the perioperative period. Participants (n = 144) were enrolled and randomly assigned into group TEAS or group sham TEAS. TEAS on bilateral Feishu (BL13), Hegu (L14), and Zusanli (ST36) was performed continuously throughout the procedure. The primary outcome was the quantities of natural killer (NK) cells at 30 minutes before induction (T0), 5 minutes after intubation (T1), at the beginning of the operation (T2), at the beginning of the lobectomy (T3), at the beginning of the lymphadenectomy (T4), and immediately after extubation (T5). The secondary outcomes were the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) at T0 to T5, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), the intraoperative consumption of propofol and remifentanil, the incidence of hypoxemia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and the length of hospital stay. The quantities of NK cells were decreased in group sham TEAS after intubation compared to that in group TEAS, while the quantities of NK cells in group TEAS were similar at T0 to T5. Meanwhile, the quantities of NK cells in group sham TEAS at T1 ( P = .012), T2 ( P < .001), T3 ( P = .027), T4 ( P = .045), and T5 ( P = .021) were lower than those in group TEAS. In group TEAS, the serum levels of TNF- were lower at T1 to T5, while the levels of IL-6 were lower at T2 to T5. Furthermore, the intraoperative MAP and HR were more stable, the total propofol and remifentanil consumptions were lower, and the length of hospital stay was shorter than those in group sham TEAS. The application of TEAS can effectively reverse the decrease in NK cells, decrease the serum levels of TNF- and IL-6, maintain hemodynamic stability during the perioperative period, decrease the consumption of propofol and remifentanil, and shorten the length of the hospital stay.","output":"Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation Improves Immunological Function During the Perioperative Period in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgical Lobectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic and several vaccines have now received emergency use authorization. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against re-infection, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.Importance:The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","output":"Transmission and protection against re-infection in the ferret model with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 reference isolate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Encapsulation of germline cells by layers of somatic cells forms the basic unit of female reproduction called primordial follicles in mammals and egg chambers in Drosophila. How germline and somatic tissues are coordinated for the morphogenesis of each separated unit remains poorly understood. Here, using improved live imaging of Drosophila ovaries, we uncovered periodic actomyosin waves at the cortex of germ cells. These contractile waves are associated with pressure release blebs, which project from germ cells into somatic cells. We demonstrate that these cortical activities, together with cadherin-based adhesion, are required to sort each germline cyst as one collective unit. Genetic perturbations of cortical contractility, bleb protrusion, or adhesion between germline and somatic cells induced encapsulation defects resulting from failures to encapsulate any germ cells, or the inclusion of too many germ cells per egg chamber, or even the mechanical split of germline cysts. Live-imaging experiments revealed that reducing contractility or adhesion in the germline reduced the stiffness of germline cysts and their proper anchoring to the somatic cells. Germline cysts can then be squeezed and passively pushed by constricting surrounding somatic cells, resulting in cyst splitting and cyst collisions during encapsulation. Increasing germline cysts activity or blocking somatic cell constriction movements can reveal active forward migration of germline cysts. Our results show that germ cells play an active role in physical coupling with somatic cells to produce the female gamete.","output":"Collective Cell Sorting Requires Contractile Cortical Waves in Germline Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Copay assistance programs provide financial assistance for patients to access medicines and may be one solution to addressing patient affordability, especially because of additional financial hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These programs have been scrutinized by payers and policymakers, but there is little information on the patient perspective to inform these policy discussions. OBJECTIVE: To understand patients' perspectives and use of copay assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional online descriptive patient survey was administered to collect data from adult recent medication users and caregivers. Data on demographics, skipping/stopping medications, current/past/future use of copay assistance, perceptions of copay assistance, and alternative actions taken if copay assistance was unavailable were collected. Descriptive analysis was conducted across the total sample, with subgroup analysis between those using and not using specialty pharmacies conducted on select measures. Analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.2. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 1,001 adults aged 18 years or older. Twenty-eight percent of respondents reported currently or previously using copay assistance, with use higher among specialty pharmacy users vs non-specialty pharmacy users (46% vs 15%, P < 0.01). Copay assistance programs were viewed positively by most respondents (> 70%), with the proportion who viewed them \\"somewhat or more positively\\" during the COVID-19 pandemic growing significantly more among specialty pharmacy users than among non-specialty pharmacy users (53% vs 24%, P < 0.01). Respondents using copay assistance programs indicated they would take on more debt and cut back in other areas as alternatives to copay assistance, if unavailable. The alternative actions differed by specialty pharmacy use, with specialty pharmacy users reporting being more likely to use savings/retirement funds to help cover the cost (44% vs 22%, P < 0.01) or switch insurance plans (36% vs 22%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' positive perceptions of copay assistance programs have grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and removing access to these programs may result in further debt and/or loss of savings for patients, especially for those using specialty medicines. Future patient-centric research is warranted and should be central to informing future policy discussions on the regulation of copay assistance programs. DISCLOSURES: W. Wong and K.

Moreover, CO, NO(2), and O(3) tropospheric levels were collected using Sentinel-5P satellite data. The spatial distribution of variables was estimated by the ordinary Kriging and inverse weighted distance (IDW) models. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the relationship between environmental variables and COVID-19. The seasonal trend of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), wind speed, solar energy, and rainfall like COVID-19 was upward in spring and summer. The high and low temperatures increased from April to August.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and usability of digital tools integrated into a pediatric patient registry for ARI. METHODS: Semistructured interviews and software interface usability testing were conducted with 11 parents and 8 emergency department physicians working at a tertiary pediatric hospital and research center in Perth, Western Australia, in 2019. Questions focused on experiences of discharge communication and clinical trial engagement. Responses were analyzed using the qualitative Framework Method. Participants were directly observed using digital interfaces as they attempted predetermined tasks that were then classified as success, failure, software failure, or not observed. Participants rated the interfaces using the System Usability Scale (SUS). RESULTS: Most parents (9/11, 82%) indicated that they usually received verbal discharge advice, with some (5/11, 45%) recalling receiving preprinted resources from their physician. Most (8/11, 73%) would also like to receive discharge advice electronically. Most of the physicians (7/8, 88%) described their usual practice as verbal discharge instructions, with some (3/8, 38%) reporting time pressures associated with providing discharge instructions. The digital technology option was preferred for engaging in research by most parents (8/11, 73%).

The linkage between and understanding of the physical dose and induced biological perturbations are opening entirely new areas of application. The ability to define anatomic extent of disease and the elucidation of the biology of metastases has brought a key role for radiation oncology for treating metastatic disease. That radiation can stimulate and suppress subpopulations of the immune response makes radiation a key participant in cancer immunotherapy. Targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy delivers radiation systemically with radionuclides and carrier molecules selected for their physical, chemical, and biochemical properties. Radiation oncology usage of big data and machine learning and artificial intelligence adds the opportunity to markedly change the workflow for clinical practice while physically targeting and adapting radiation fields in real time. Future precision targeting requires multidimensional understanding of the imaging, underlying biology, and anatomical relationship among tissues for radiation as spatial and temporal focused biology. Other means of energy delivery are available as are agents that can be activated by radiation with increasing ability to target treatments. With broad applicability of radiation in cancer treatment, radiation therapy is a necessity for effective cancer care, opening a career path for global health serving the medically underserved in geographically isolated populations as a substantial societal contribution addressing health disparities.

These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education. Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences. To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses; (2) multilevel models; and (3) person-specific network models, (e.g., group iterative multiple model estimation; GIMME). For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election - a period of heightened sociopolitical stress - and strengths and limitations are considered.

While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Thus, assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and tight control of hemodynamic parameters upon admission are crucial to minimize mortality and morbidity in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with central nervous system symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke.","output":"Potential mechanisms of hemorrhagic stroke in elderly COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystem disease that presents acute and persistent symptoms, the postacute sequelae (PASC). Long-term symptoms may be due to consequences from organ or tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2, associated clotting or inflammatory processes during acute COVID-19. Various strategies are being chosen by clinicians to prevent severe cases of COVID-19; however, a single treatment would not be efficient in treating such a complex disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are known for their immunomodulatory properties and regeneration ability; therefore, they are a promising tool for treating disorders involving immune dysregulation and extensive tissue damage, as is the case with COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the safety and explore the long-term efficacy of three intravenous doses of UC-MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs) as an adjunctive therapy in the recovery and postacute sequelae reduction caused by COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is one of the few reports that presents the longest follow-up after MSC treatment in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a phase I/II, prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Seventeen patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who require intensive care surveillance and invasive mechanical ventilationcritically ill patientswere included. The patient infusion was three doses of 5  10(5) cells/kg UC-MSCs, with a dosing interval of 48 h (n = 11) or placebo (n = 6). The evaluations consisted of a clinical assessment, viral load, laboratory testing, including blood count, serologic, biochemical, cell subpopulation, cytokines and CT scan. RESULTS: The results revealed that in the UC-MSC group, there was a reduction in the levels of ferritin, IL-6 and MCP1-CCL2 on the fourteen day. In the second month, a decrease in the levels of reactive C-protein, D-dimer and neutrophils and an increase in the numbers of TCD3, TCD4 and NK lymphocytes were observed. A decrease in extension of lung damage was observed at the fourth month. The improvement in all these parameters was maintained until the end of patient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: UC-MSCs infusion is safe and can play an important role as an adjunctive therapy, both in the early stages, preventing severe complications and in the chronic phase with postacute sequelae reduction in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The routine nature of equine care lends itself to positive habit formation in people. This study addresses a gap in evidence and understanding of the impact of an intervention designed to develop PAWHBs in equine carers. People caring for horses and donkeys were asked to perform an enrichment behaviour with an equine in the form of scratching them in a consistent context linked to an existing routine behaviour. The findings indicated that linking new behaviours to existing routine behaviours can aid the development of pro-animal welfare habits. This also highlighted the role of the equine in triggering the new behaviour to be performed, the potential mutual benefit from engaging in the scratching behaviour for human and equine animal, and the positive emotions resulting from the action, which in turn promotes the repetition of behaviour. The findings mirror the theory of the habit loop: a cue to do a behaviour, the performance of the behaviour in response to the cue, and then the reward for doing the behaviour. ABSTRACT: This paper explores the potential for interventions to develop pro-animal welfare habitual behaviours (PAWHBs) in people to improve the lives of animals. Human behavioural research indicates that opportunities exist to deliver lasting change through developing positive habitual behaviours. The routine nature of many equine care and management practices lends itself to habit formation and maintenance. This proof-of-concept paper aims to evaluate a theory-based intervention of developing and maintaining a PAWHB in people caring for equines. Qualitative research methods were used. A 30 day PAWHB intervention (PAWHBInt) of providing enrichment to an equine by scratching them in a consistent context linked to an existing routine behaviour was undertaken. Participants (n = 9) then engaged in semi-structured interviews that were analysed using thematic analysis, where the participants self-reported the outcomes they observed during the intervention. The study findings suggest that the PAWHBInt had a positive impact on human behaviour and habit formation. The research helps to address the dearth of evidence regarding the application of habit theory to equine welfare interventions and emphasised linking a desired new behaviour to an existing routine behaviour when developing PAWHBs. The research also highlights the role of mutual benefit for human and equine, and emotion in providing feedback and potential reward, supporting the link to the cue-routine-reward principle of habit theory.","output":"Improving Equine Welfare through Human Habit Formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be associated with nonspecific symptoms such as dyspnea, tachycardia, anorexia, and vomiting that are similar to COVID\\\\19.

The University of Geneva decided to shift on-site classwork to online learning; many exams were transformed from summative to formative evaluations and most clinical activities were suspended. We aimed to investigate the perceived impact of those adaptations by the students at the Faculty of Medicine. METHODS: We sent an online self-administered survey to medical students from years 2 to 6 of the University of Geneva, three months after the beginning of the pandemic. The survey explored students main activities during the first three months of the pandemic, the impact of the crisis on their personal life, on their training and on their professional identity, the level of stress they experienced and which coping strategies they developed. The survey consisted of open-ended and closed questions and was administered in French. RESULTS: A total of 58.8% of students responded (n = 467) and were homogeneously distributed across gender. At the time of the survey, two thirds of the participants were involved in COVID-19-related activities; 72.5% voluntarily participated, mainly fueled by a desire to help and feel useful. Many participants (58.8%) reported a feeling of isolation encountered since the start of the pandemic. Main coping strategies reported were physical activity and increased telecommunications with their loved ones. Most students described a negative impact of the imposed restrictions on their training, reporting decreased motivation and concentration in an unusual or distraction-prone study environment at home and missing interactions with peers and teachers. Students recruited to help at the hospital in the context of increasing staff needs reported a positive impact due to the enriched clinical exposure. Perceived stress levels were manageable across the surveyed population. If changed, the crisis had a largely positive impact on students professional identity; most highlighted the importance of the health care profession for society and confirmed their career choice. CONCLUSION: Through this comprehensive picture, our study describes the perceived impact of the pandemic on University of Geneva medical students, their training and their professional identity three months after the start of the pandemic. These results allowed us to gain valuable insight that reinforced the relevance of assessing the evolution of the situation in the long run and the importance of developing institutional support tools for medical students throughout their studies.

The objective was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life course. Design: A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline. All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full text level. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed an association with population level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes. There were no restrictions on year of publication, country or population. Non-English and earthquake related studies were excluded. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (e.g., type of disaster, name of specific event, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes, and measures of effect. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results: A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood. Studies included exposure to natural (60%) and human-made (40%) disasters, with only 3 (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics. Most studies were conducted in North America (62%). Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes, and obesity. Few studies investigated potential mechanisms or identified high risk subgroups.

An intervention targeted to a single disease may be preferred to a broader intervention in a single-disease model, but this conclusion might change if outcomes from the additional diseases were included. However, multidisease models are often complex and difficult to construct. METHODS We present conditions for when multiple diseases should be considered in such a CEA. We propose methods for estimating health outcomes and costs associated with control of additional diseases using parallel single-disease models. Parallel modeling can incorporate competing mortality and coinfection from multiple diseases while maintaining model simplicity. We illustrate our approach with a CEA that compares a dengue vaccine, a chikungunya vaccine, and mosquito control via insecticide and mosquito nets, which can prevent dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. RESULTS The parallel models and the multidisease model generated similar estimates of disease incidence and deaths with much less complexity. When using this method in our case study, considering only chikungunya and dengue, the preferred strategy was insecticide. A broader strategy-insecticide plus long-lasting insecticide-treated nets-was not preferred when Zika and yellow fever were included, suggesting the conclusion is robust even without the explicit inclusion of all affected diseases. LIMITATIONS Parallel modeling assumes independent probabilities of infection for each disease. CONCLUSIONS When multidisease effects are important, our parallel modeling method can be used to model multiple diseases accurately while avoiding additional complexity.","output":"Assessing Interventions That Prevent Multiple Infectious Diseases: Simple Methods for Multidisease Modeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sulfonated--cyclodextrin (-CD-SO(3)H) promoted efficient and fast electrophilic substitution reaction of indoles with various isatins reflux in water is reported affording various 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones in good to excellent yields in short reaction time.","output":"An efficient synthesis of 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones catalyzed by sulfonated -CD as a supramolecular catalyst in water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About the Authors: Ursula Neu Affiliation: Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Freie Universit?t Berlin, Berlin, Germany ORCID logo http://orcid org/0000-0001-6852-0879 Bernardo A Mainou * E-mail: bernardo mainou@emory edu Affiliations Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America, Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America ORCID logo http://orcid org/0000-0002-7721-183X Citation: Neu U, Mainou BA (2020) Virus interactions with bacteria: Interestingly, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria also provide protection from bleach treatment to Aichi, Mengo, and poliovirus [5] [ ]binding of HNoV to HBGAs protects the virus from heat stress [8] Fecal transfer from mice bearing segmented filamentous bacteria also protects susceptible animals from infection with IAV, vesicular stomatitis virus, and reovirus Surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide with membrane disruptive properties produced by Bacillus subtilis [27], disrupts coronavirus virion integrity and impairs the infectivity of several enveloped viruses, including Chikungunya, CrimeanCCongo hemorrhagic fever, Dugbe, Ebola, IAV, Mayaro, Nipah, Una, and Zika [28]","output":"Virus interactions with bacteria: Partners in the infectious dance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of the survey was to find out what the possible consequences are of the COVID-19 disease on the nervous system and to propose a method of using artificial intelligence.

Current state-of-the-art cryoET combined with subtomogram averaging analysis enables the high-resolution structural determination of macromolecular complexes that are present in multiple copies within tomographic reconstructions. Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described. The presented pipeline is particularly suited to maximizing the time-efficiency of tomography experiments that require a careful selection of acquisition targets and at the same time a large amount of tilt series to be collected.","output":"Strategies for Optimization of Cryogenic Electron Tomography Data Acquisition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks are a primary preventive measure against airborne pathogens. Thus, they have become one of the keys to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Common examples, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and face coverings, are passive devices that minimize the spread of suspended pathogens by inserting an aerosol-filtering barrier between the users nasal and oral cavities and the environment. However, the filtering process does not adapt to changing pathogen levels or other environmental factors, which reduces its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the limitations of passive masks by proposing ADAPT, a smart IoT-enabled active mask. This wearable device contains a real-time closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes near the mask by using an on-board particulate matter (PM) sensor. It then intelligently mitigates the threat by using mist spray, generated by a piezoelectric actuator, to load nearby aerosol particles such that they rapidly fall to the ground. The system is controlled by an on-board micro-controller unit that collects sensor data, analyzes it, and activates the mist generator as necessary. A custom smartphone application enables the user to remotely control the device and also receive real-time alerts related to recharging, refilling, and/or decontamination of the mask before reuse. Experimental results on a working prototype confirm that aerosol clouds rapidly fall to the ground when the mask is activated, thus significantly reducing PM counts near the user. Also, usage of the mask significantly increases local relative humidity levels.","output":"A smart mask for active defense against airborne pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the level of fear of coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in Saudi Arabia and the association of its scores with their level of health literacy.

A three-part online self-reported survey was used to assess the participants' demographic characteristics, fear of COVID-19 of the participants, and levels of health literacy. RESULTS: Of the 848 participants, 56.8% were in the age group of 25C34, 45.6% were females, and 57.1% had a bachelor's degree. The total mean score of the fear of COVID-19 scale of the participants was FCoV-19: mean  SD = 19.60  7.33 and the health literacy was HL index: mean  SD = 27.57  11.05. There was a significant difference in the scores of fear of COVID-19 scale in terms of age (F = 2.442, p = 0.050), representing that those aged 45 and above had higher mean fear scores than the younger participants.

We aimed to assess the timeliness of contact tracing among airline passengers arriving in Vietnam on flights containing COVID-19 cases and investigated factors associated with timeliness of contact tracing. METHODS: We included data from 2228 passengers on 22 incoming flights between 2 and 19 March 2020. Contact tracing duration was assessed separately for the time between the date of index case confirmation and date of contact tracing initiation (interval I), and the date of contact tracing initiation and completion (interval II). We used log-rank tests and multivariable Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with timeliness. RESULTS: The median duration of interval I and interval II was one (IQR: 1-2) and 3 days (IQR: 2-5), respectively. The contact tracing duration was shorter for passengers from flights where the index case was identified through mandatory testing directly upon arrival (median = 4; IQR: 3-5) compared to flights with index case detection through self-presentation at health facilities after arrival (median = 7; IQR: 5-8) (p-value = 0.018). Cumulative hazards for successful tracing were higher for Vietnamese nationals compared to non-Vietnamese nationals (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing among flight passengers in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam was timely though delays occurred on high workload days. Mandatory SARS-CoV-2 testing at arrival may reduce contact tracing duration and should be considered as an integrated screening tool for flight passengers from high-risk areas when entering low-transmission settings with limited contact tracing capacity.

METHODS: This was a retrospective outcomes study of renal transplant patients seen in Iraqi Kurdistan nephrology clinics in the year 2019. In 2019, 871 renal transplant patients were registered and outcomes followed through 12/31/2020. Indicated renal biopsies were obtained on 431 patients at 1 day to 18 years post-transplantation. Outcomes were compared with United States Renal Data System (USRDS) living donor reports. RESULTS: All donors were living. The recipient age was 38.5  13.3 years, 98.2% were < 65 years old, 3.7% had previous transplants, and 2.8% had pretransplant donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Gehan-Breslow estimated failure rates for all-cause, return to HD, and death with functional graft were 6.0, 4.2, and 1.9% at 1 year and 18.1, 13.7, and 5.1% at 5 years post-engraftment (USRDS 2000; 1 year: 7.0, 5.0, 2.6%; 5 year: 22.3, 15.2, 10.6%.

One such human cognitive factor: inattention blindness (IB), describes the inability to perceive objects despite being visible, typically when ones attention is focused on another task. This may contribute toward operative never-events such as retained foreign objects and wrong-site surgery. METHODS: An 8-week, mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) programme, adapted for surgeons, was delivered virtually. Neurosurgical trainees and recent staff-appointees who completed the MBI were compared against a control group, matched in age, sex and grade. Attention and IB were tested using two operative videos. In each, participants were first instructed to focus on a specific part of the procedure and assessed (attention), then questioned on a separate but easily visible aspect within the operative field (inattention). If a participant were inattentionally blind they would miss significant events occurring outside of their main focus. Median absolute error (MAE) scores were calculated for both attention and inattention. A generalised linear model was fitted for each, to determine the independent effect of mindfulness intervention on MAE. RESULTS: Thirteen neurosurgeons completed the mindfulness training (age, 30 years [range 27C35]; female:male, 5:8), compared to 15 neurosurgeons in the control group (age, 30 years [27C42]; female:male, 6:9). There were no significant demographic differences between groups. MBI participants demonstrated no significant differences on attention tasks as compared to controls (t = ?1.50, p = 0.14). For inattention tasks, neurosurgeons who completed the MBI had significantly less errors (t = ?2.47, p = 0.02), after adjusting for participant level and video differences versus controls. We found that both groups significantly improved their inattention error rate between videos (t = ?11.37, p < 0.0001). In spite of this, MBI participants still significantly outperformed controls in inattention MAE in the second video following post-hoc analysis (MWU = 137.5, p = 0.05).

Later, an association between BEN and tumours of the kidney pelvis and ureter was recognized, so that the problem of BEN became not only nephrological, but also oncological. There may also be an association with increased urinary bladder cancer incidence, although many confounding factors may interfere in the analysis of data for this organ. In view of the very intimate association between BEN and the urinary tract tumours (UTT), the term 'endemic uropathy' has been proposed. Several hypothesis concerning the aetiology of these diseases has been investigated, which include: predisposing genes factors, environmental factors (heavy metals, minerals, bacteria, leptospira, viruses, fungal toxins and, most recently, pliocene lignites). This paper reviews the different hypotheses about the aetiology of endemic uropathy and pays particular attention to the role of fungal toxins.","output":"Balkan endemic nephropathy and associated urinary tract tumours: a review on aetiological causes and the potential role of mycotoxins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data indicate that a large part of population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Hence, it is of high importance for public health officials to know whether people are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to examine the willingness of adult residents in Greece to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional was survey conducted among the adult general population of Greece between April 28, 2020 to May 03, 2020 (last week of lockdown), using a mixed methodology for data collection: Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer Assisted web Interviewing (CAWI). Using a sample size calculator, the target sample size was found to be around 1000 respondents. To ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population according to the Greek census 2011, a proportionate stratified by region systematic sampling procedure was used to recruit particpants. Data collection was guided through a structured questionnaire. Regarding willingness to COVID-19 vaccination, participants were asked to answer the following question: \\"If there was a vaccine available for the novel coronavirus, would you do it?\\" RESULTS: Of 1004 respondents only 57.7% stated that they are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Respondents aged > 65 years old, those who either themselves or a member of their household belonged to a vulnerable group, those believing that the COVID-19 virus was not developed in laboratories by humans, those believing that coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal compared to the H1N1 virus, and those believing that next waves are coming were statistically significantly more likely to be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Higher knowledge score regarding symptoms, transmission routes and prevention and control measures against COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher willingness of respondents to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of individuals in the general population are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, stressing the need for public health officials to take immediate awareness-raising measures.","output":"Willingness of Greek general population to get a COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common neurocognitive complication after cardiac surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether the administration of dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Central, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, and Web of Science databases were searched for RCTs of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery where participants received i.v. dexmedetomidine or control in the perioperative period. The methods included systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. Dichotomous outcomes were presented as risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel method, and continuous variables were presented as mean difference with the inverse variance method. RESULTS: Thirty trials, comprising 4090 patients, were included. With unselected inclusion of trials, dexmedetomidine vs control was associated with decreased incidence of postoperative delirium (12.4% vs 16.2%; RR=0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.86; P=0.005; I2=61%). If trials at high risk of bias were excluded, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly different between groups (RR=0.71; 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.03; P=0.070; I2=58%). Postoperative delirium was not a reliably determined outcome across trials because of methodological and reporting limitations, including the heterogeneity of delirium diagnostic approach. Trial sequential analysis revealed that the optimal information size was not reached, and the Z-curve did not cross the trial sequential boundaries for benefit or futility. With respect to safety concerns, dexmedetomidine was not significantly associated with incident bradycardia or hypotension, or with the duration of mechanical ventilation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between HCW status and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 across 36 North American centers from April 15 to June 5, 2020. Data were collected from 1992 patients. Data were analyzed from September 10 to October 1, 2020. EXPOSURES: Data on patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, treatments, and outcomes were collected, including HCW status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to yield adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs for the association between HCW status and COVID-19Crelated outcomes in a 3:1 propensity scoreCmatched cohort, adjusting for residual confounding after matching. RESULTS: In total, 1790 patients were included, comprising 127 HCWs and 1663 non-HCWs. After 3:1 propensity score matching, 122 HCWs were matched to 366 non-HCWs. Women comprised 71 (58.2%) of matched HCWs and 214 (58.5%) of matched non-HCWs. Matched HCWs had a mean (SD) age of 52 (13) years, whereas matched non-HCWs had a mean (SD) age of 57 (17) years. In the matched cohort, the odds of the primary outcome, mechanical ventilation or death, were not significantly different for HCWs compared with non-HCWs (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-1.04). The HCWs were less likely to require admission to an intensive care unit (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.92) and were also less likely to require an admission of 7 days or longer (AOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). There were no differences between matched HCWs and non-HCWs in terms of mechanical ventilation (AOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37-1.17), death (AOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18-1.27), or vasopressor requirements (AOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37-1.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this propensity scoreCmatched multicenter cohort study, HCW status was not associated with poorer outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and, in fact, was associated with a shorter length of hospitalization and decreased likelihood of intensive care unit admission.

Our objectives were to explore the differences in ischemic and hemorrhagic events when using OAC for secondary stroke prevention according to the type of anticoagulant treatment and to analyze the number and reasons for OAC switches during long-term follow-up. Methods: Ischemic stroke (IS) patients who were discharged on OAC for secondary stroke prevention from January 2014 to October 2017 were recruited in a prospective, multicenter, hospital-based registry. Follow-up at 3 months was scheduled at the outpatient clinic with subsequent annual phone interviews for 3 years. Patients were classified into three study groups according to OAC at discharge: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA), Factor Xa inhibitor (FXa), or direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI). We compared stroke recurrences, intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality during the follow-up. We recorded any switches in OAC and the main reasons for the change. Results: A total of 241 patients were included. An anticoagulant was indicated in the presence of a source of cardioembolic stroke in 240 patients (99.6%) and lupus plus antiphospholipid syndrome in one patient. Up to 86 patients (35.6%) were on OAC before the index stroke; in 71 (82.5%) of them, this was VKA. At hospital discharge, 105 were treated with FXa (43.8%), 96 with VKA (39.6%), and 40 with DTI (16.6%). The cumulative incidences at 3 years were 17% for stroke recurrence, 1.6% for intracranial hemorrhage, 4.9% for major hemorrhage, and 22.8% for all-cause mortality, with no differences among the OAC groups in any outcomes. During the follow-up, 40 OAC switches were recorded (63% of them to FXa), mostly due to stroke recurrence. Conclusion: Long-term OAC in secondary stroke prevention is associated with a lower frequency of bleeding complications than stroke recurrences. No differences between anticoagulant drugs were found in any of the analyzed outcomes. The main cause for OAC switch during follow-up was stroke recurrence.","output":"Long-Term Anticoagulation in Secondary Ischemic Stroke Prevention: The Prospective Multicenter RESTAIC Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The text discusses the difficulties to face COVID-19 raised by the speech and the actions defended by the federal government In contrast to the governments of countries that have achieved effective results in controlling the pandemic, representatives of the Brazilian government, among which the President of the Republic stands out, are continually disqualify publicly both risks and the adoption of scientifically based prevention measures, in particular social isolation, defending, in its place, the so-called herd immunity The reiterated argument is that there is an opposition between the preservation of the economy and life, the former being a priority Such manifestations are accompanied by constraints on state and municipal governments in carrying out locally defined preventive measures This attitude expresses contempt for human life and an acute disregard for the socially most vulnerable population, which, in countries with chronic inequalities, such as Brazil, suffer the most serious effects of an epidemic","output":"COVID-19 macabre nightmare in Brazil: between denials and ravings O pesadelo macabro da Covid-19 no Brasil: entre negacionismos e desvarios/ COVID-19 macabre nightmare in Brazil: between denials and ravings La pesadilla macabra de Covid-19 en Brasil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a new model for contagion spread using a network of interacting finite memory two-color P\\\\'{o}lya urns, which we refer to as the finite memory interacting P\\\\'{o}lya contagion network.

Although the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and its effects on tumorigenesis are both highly context-dependent, mechanisms underlying such diversity are becoming better understood, thereby allowing the creation of new strategies to effectively target the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and senescent cells for cancer therapy.

However, RL can be slow as it requires repeated interaction with a simulation of the environment. In particular, there are key system engineering bottlenecks when using RL in complex environments that feature multiple agents with high-dimensional state, observation, or action spaces. We present WarpDrive, a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source RL framework that implements end-to-end deep multi-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), built on PyCUDA and PyTorch. Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, WarpDrive enables orders-of-magnitude faster RL compared to common implementations that blend CPU simulations and GPU models. Our design runs simulations and the agents in each simulation in parallel. It eliminates data copying between CPU and GPU. It also uses a single simulation data store on the GPU that is safely updated in-place. WarpDrive provides a lightweight Python interface and flexible environment wrappers that are easy to use and extend. Together, this allows the user to easily run thousands of concurrent multi-agent simulations and train on extremely large batches of experience. Through extensive experiments, we verify that WarpDrive provides high-throughput and scales almost linearly to many agents and parallel environments. For example, WarpDrive yields 2.9 million environment steps/second with 2000 environments and 1000 agents (at least 100x higher throughput compared to a CPU implementation) in a benchmark Tag simulation. As such, WarpDrive is a fast and extensible multi-agent RL platform to significantly accelerate research and development.","output":"WarpDrive: Extremely Fast End-to-End Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on a GPU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high-resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor-binding domain of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation are strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein.

The Health Care Workers (HCWs) are presumably exposed to a higher risk of acquiring the disease owing to their regular contact with the patients. Methods COVID-19 prevalence was investigated by classifying 313 HCWs into four groups based on their degree of exposure and estimating the IgG and total antibody. The serological assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was conducted 21 days post-vaccination of first or both doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among 174 HCWs. The vaccinated HCWs were followed up for 3 months for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were comparable among different groups, but the seroprevalence gradually decreased from the most exposed to the less exposed group. The neutralizing antibody was positively correlated with IgG as well as total antibody. IgG was marginally decreased after 2 months followed by a significant drop after 4-6 months post-infection. However, 80% of the HCWs developed a detectable amount of IgG after the first dose of vaccination, the median titer of which was comparable to the seropositive HCWs after natural infection. Almost 100% of the HCWs developed antibodies after the second dose of vaccine with boosting effect among the seropositive HCWs. Although ~11.5% of the vaccinated HCWs were infected with the SARS-CoV-2, ~94% of them showed mild symptoms and recovered in home isolation without any O2 support. Interpretations The varying level of seroprevalence among the four groups suggested a stratified spread of the disease. One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was found to be effective in terms of the antibody titer, while the second dose was required to cover the larger population. The effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was noticeable due to the low rate of post-vaccination infection with moderate or severe symptoms.","output":"Seroprevalence and Dynamics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare workers following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most unicellular organisms live in communities and express different phenotypes.

Databases are generated for two aircraft configurations, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Common Research Model and the Generic T-tail Transport aircraft. Samples from the databases, representing different aircraft behavior, are created. Each sample is run through a flight simulation representing a real-world airworthiness test performed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These tests are agglomerated to create distributions of the performance metrics, quantifying the probability that the aircraft succeeds in performing the certification maneuver. Simulating flight certification testing before building a full-size aircraft prototype mitigates the enormous costs of expensive redesigns late in the aircraft design process. The calculation of the failure rates provides design suggestions to ensure the aircraft can meet the certification requirement with a prescribed success rate.","output":"Probabilistic Analysis of Aircraft Using Multi-Fidelity Aerodynamics Databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To provide clinical references for the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilic pseudotumor (HPT) in maxillofacial region. Methods: Fourteen cases of HPT in maxillofacial region from the Department of Stomatology, Beijing Children's Hospital from Jan 2009 to Jan 2019 were collected. Two cases were lost for follow-up and 12 patient,all boys, were finally followed up and included in the study. The patients aged from 13 months to 10 years old. The medical history, clinic manefestitions and the features of the radiology examination were recorded. The patients were treated by using replacement treatment first. If the conservative treatment was not effective, the patients then received operation combined with pereoperation replacement thearapy. The patients were followed up for 13 months to 10 years.There were 11 cases of hemophilia A, and 1 case of hemophilia B. Two cases were severe type, the others (10/12) were mild and moderate types. Only 1 case was diagnosed as hemophilia initially. Nine cases (9/12) were misdiagnosed as malignant tumors, 1 case was misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis and 1 case was misdiagnosed as hemangioma. Only 3 cases had identified history of trauma before. Results: All cases were treated with replacement therapy first, among which 10 cases were effective, 8 cases were cured by conservative therapy, 1 case had residual soft tissue fistula after conservative treatment and 1 case recurrented after conservative treatment for 8 months. Two patients with poor efficacy to the replacement treatment were performed operations and finally were cured. Conclusions: The misdiagnosis rate of HPT in maxillofacial region was high. The conservative factor replacement therapy could achieve good results in most children and could be used as the preferred treatment. If the conservative treatment was not effective, the surgical treatment was also a safe option.","output":"[A retrospective study of hemophilic pseudotumor in maxillofacial region]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses employ a variety of strategies to usurp and control cellular activities through the orchestrated recruitment of macromolecules to specific cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments.

These virus-induced compartments function not only to recruit and concentrate factors required for essential steps of the viral replication cycle but also to control the cellular mechanisms of antiviral defense.

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228  0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28  0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July-11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak.

Despite the latter, research showed that up to 75% of South African SMMEs fail after being in operation for three years. More often than not, the blame for the foregoing dispensation is placed on an unconducive economic environment however this was before the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. From February 2020, the South African government put measures in place to contain and/or eradicate the spreading of COVID-19. One of these measures was a national lockdown that prohibited the trading of non-essential goods and the rendering of non-essential services (from 26 March 2020 to 30 April 2020). Though noble, the reality at play is that the national lockdown caused national economic activities to come to a halt which, in turn, resulted in the temporary closure of many South African SMMEs. This is particularly the case despite national governments initiatives put in place to assist SMMEs to remain afloat during the national lockdown. With South Africa having no choice but to embrace the fourth industrial revolution, like all other countries, this working paper addresses how South African SMMEs sustainability can be aided post-COVID-19.

Angiographic aneurysm recurrence is widely used as a surrogate for treatment failure, but studies documenting the correlation of angiographic recurrence with clinical failure are limited. This trial compares the effectiveness of Matrix(2) polyglycolic/polylactic acid biopolymer-modified coils with bare metal coils and correlates the angiographic findings with clinical failure (ie, target aneurysm recurrence), a composite end point that includes any incident of posttreatment aneurysm rupture, retreatment, or unexplained death. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial with blinded end point adjudication. We enrolled 626 patients, divided between Matrix(2) and bare metal coil groups. The primary outcome was target aneurysm recurrence at 12  3 months. RESULTS At 455 days, at least 1 target aneurysm recurrence event had occurred in 14.6% of patients treated with bare metal coils and 13.3% of Matrix(2) (P = .76, log-rank test) patients; 92.8% of target aneurysm recurrence events were re-interventions for aneurysms that had not bled after treatment, and 5.8% of target aneurysm recurrence events resulted from hemorrhage or rehemorrhage, with or without retreatment. Symptomatic re-intervention occurred in only 4 (0.6%) patients. At 455 days, 95.8% of patients with unruptured aneurysms and 90.4% of those with ruptured aneurysms were independent (mRS  2). Target aneurysm recurrence was associated with incomplete initial angiographic aneurysm obliteration, presentation with rupture, and a larger aneurysmal dome and neck size. CONCLUSIONS Tested Matrix(2) coils were not inferior to bare metal coils. Endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms was safe, and the rate of technical success was high.

EXPERT OPINION The X-ray crystal structures of some of these proteases, alone and in complex with various inhibitors, were crucial for the discovery of effective such compounds, some of which also showed considerable antiviral activity and are considered preclinical candidates to fight these emerging infections, which in the case of Covid-19 already provoked an unprecedented worldwide pandemic.","output":"Protease inhibitors targeting the main protease and papain-like protease of coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Between 30 and 50% of febrile neutropenic episodes are accounted for by infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific parameter for infection and inflammation but might be employed as a trigger for diagnosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT can be used to detect inflammatory foci in neutropenic patients with elevated CRP and whether it helps to direct treatment. METHODS Twenty-eight consecutive patients with neutropenia as a result of intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancies or myeloablative therapy for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation were prospectively included. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was added to the regular diagnostic workup once the CRP level rose above 50 mg/l. RESULTS Pathological FDG uptake was found in 26 of 28 cases despite peripheral neutrophil counts less than 0.1  10(-9)/l in 26 patients: in the digestive tract in 18 cases, around the tract of the central venous catheter (CVC) in 9 and in the lungs in 7 cases. FDG uptake in the CVC tract was associated with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia (p < 0.001) and deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.002). The number of patients having Streptococcus mitis bacteraemia appeared to be higher in patients with grade 3 oesophageal FDG uptake (p = 0.08). Pulmonary FDG uptake was associated with the presence of invasive fungal disease (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET/CT scanning during chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and increased CRP is able to detect localized foci of infection and inflammation despite the absence of circulating neutrophils. Besides its potential role in detecting CVC-related infection during febrile neutropenia, the high negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT is important for avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapy.","output":"18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosing infectious complications in patients with severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy or stem cell transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Man is always curious about the patterns and beauty of platonic solids.

Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing \\"WE-RISE\\" randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological wellbeing was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test.

ERVEBO? is an effective recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-vectored Ebola virus vaccine (VSV-EBOV) that was approved by the FDA and EMA in late 2019 for use in prevention of EVD. Since the parental virus VSV, which was used to construct VSV-EBOV, is pathogenic for livestock and the vaccine virus may be shed at low levels by vaccinated humans, widespread deployment of the vaccine requires investigation into its infectivity and transmissibility in VSV-susceptible livestock species. We therefore performed a comprehensive clinical analysis of the VSV-EBOV vaccine virus in swine to determine its infectivity and potential for transmission. A high dose of VSV-EBOV resulted in VSV-like clinical signs in swine, with a proportion of pigs developing ulcerative vesicular lesions at the nasal injection site and feet. Uninoculated contact control pigs co-mingled with VSV-EBOV-inoculated pigs did not become infected or display any clinical signs of disease, indicating the vaccine is not readily transmissible to na?ve pigs during prolonged close contact. In contrast, virulent wild-type VSV Indiana had a shorter incubation period and was transmitted to contact control pigs. These results indicate that the VSV-EBOV vaccine causes vesicular illness in swine when administered at a high dose.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the adoption of these technologies across the SUD service continuum, acceptance of these technologies among service providers, and intent of providers to use these technologies after the pandemic. Additional analysis using the validated technology acceptance model (TAM) was performed to test the potential applications of these technologies after the pandemic. The study objectives were as follows: (1) to assess the use of telehealth (telephone and video technologies) for different SUD services during COVID-19 in May-June 2020, (2) to assess the intended applications of telehealth for SUD services beyond COVID-19, (3) to evaluate the perceived ease of use and value of telehealth for delivering SUD services, and (4) to assess organizational readiness for the sustained use of telehealth services. METHODS: An online survey on the use of telephonic and video services was distributed between May and August 2020 to measure the current use of these services, perceived organizational readiness to use these services, and the intent to use these services after COVID-19. In total, 8 of 10 regional Addiction Technology Transfer Centers representing 43 states distributed the survey. Individual organizations were the unit of analysis. RESULTS: In total, 457 organizations responded to the survey. Overall, the technology was widely used; >70% (n>335) of organizations reported using telephone or video platforms for most services. The odds of the intent of organizations to use these technologies to deliver services post COVID-19 were significantly greater for all but two services (ie, telephonic residential counseling and buprenorphine therapy; mean odds ratio 3.79, range 1.87-6.98). Clinical users preferred video technologies to telephone technologies for virtually all services. Readiness to use telephone and video technologies was high across numerous factors, though telephonic services were considered more accessible. Consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and ease of use influenced the intent to use both telephone and video technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The overall perceived ease of use and usefulness of telephonic and video services suggest promising post-COVID-19 applications of these services. Survey participants consistently preferred video services to telephonic services; however, the availability of telephonic services to those lacking easy access to video technology is an important characteristic of these services.

Eleven parents whose infants required medications at the time of transition home from the NICU participated in a semi-structured telephone interview post-discharge. The data were coded and analyzed for themes. RESULTS Major themes nested within the key stages of medication use in preparation for transition home from the NICU were identified: in-hospital preparation (practice early and often, Meds to Beds, and relationship with clinical pharmacist), transition home (schedule and routine, strategies for medication administration) and post-discharge (refills and long-term medication management). Strategies based on parent experiences to improve the process and ameliorate anxiety are presented. CONCLUSIONS Parents expressed how effective the Meds to Beds program was on the transition home by increasing parental confidence and knowledge around medications and reducing stress around the acquisition of medications for home. They also reported comfort in having a relationship with the NICU clinical pharmacist, providing a tailored approach to coordinating care both in hospital and during the transition home.

There was a significant difference in motor block (modified Bromage score &#8804; 4) frequency between groups, programmed intermittent epidural bolus group 1 (1.6%) vs. patient-controlled epidural analgesia group 8 (13.1%); p = 0.015. The programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had greater local anaesthetic consumption with fewer patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses. Patient satisfaction scores and obstetric or neonatal outcomes were not different between groups. In conclusion, we found that a programmed intermittent epidural bolus technique using 10 ml programmed boluses and 5 ml patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses was superior to a patient-controlled epidural analgesia technique using 5 ml boluses and no background infusion.","output":"Programmed intermittent epidural bolus vs. patient-controlled epidural analgesia for maintenance of labour analgesia: a two-centre, double-blind, randomised study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from humans to animals has been reported for many domesticated species, including farmed minks. The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. One genetic variant, known as \\"cluster five,\\" arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the world's largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the cluster-five variant, which contains a mutation resulting in a Y453F residue change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Using an ELISA-based angiotensin-converting enzyme-2/RBD inhibition assay, we show that the Y453F variant does not decrease established humoral immunity from previously infected individuals or affect the neutralizing antibody response in a vaccine mouse model based on the original Wuhan strain RBD or spike as antigens. However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor with a 4-fold higher affinity than the original strain, suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in the frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Y453F mink variant displays a pronounced increase in ACE-2 affinity but does not challenge antibody neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Evidence increases to suggest that the reallocation of health care resources during considerable the COVID-19 pandemic impacts considerably any health system.

MethodsThis retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers participating to the TraumaBase ? registry in France during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. ResultsOver a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017-2019, 4448 patients). Patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic and more specifically during the lockdown period specially with a reduction in both absolute numbers admitted and the proportion of road traffic accidents (348 annually 2017-2019 [55.4 % of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8 %] in 2020 p<0.005). Mortality during the pandemic period and the difference between predicted and observed mortality was not different compared to the non-pandemic years. ConclusionsDuring this first wave of COVID-19 in France, management of trauma patients admitted to regional Traumacenters was not significantly altered, despite medical resources being reallocated and reorganized.

We manipulated gastric rhythm using domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2/D3 antagonist and common anti-emetic, at a dose (10 mg) that acts to convert gastric dysrhythmias to normal rhythms.(9) In a preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design in 25 healthy volunteers (aged 18C25), we measured the effects of domperidone on core disgust avoidance, using eye tracking to measure implicit (oculomotor) avoidance of disgusting images (feces) before and after an exposure intervention (monetary reinforcement for looking at disgusting images).(7)(,)(8) We find that domperidone significantly reduces oculomotor disgust avoidance following incentivized exposure. This suggests that domperidone may weaken the immunity of disgust to habituation, putatively by reducing gastric dysrhythmias during incentivized engagement with disgusting stimuli.

Manifestation and CT score were compared between the death group and the survival group. In each group, patients were sub-grouped based on the time interval between symptom onset and the \\"initial CT\\" scan: subgroup1 (interval &#8804; 5 days), subgroup2 (interval between 6 and 10 days), and subgroup3 (interval > 10 days).

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain/Europe. Methods Maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Results Phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019.

Limited data is available to prove the efficacy of this drug against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Such studies have highlighted that steroids such as dexamethasone can be effective against the patients who are exhibiting severe symptoms of COVID-19. Aim: To determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone as adjunct drug in treatment of in critical COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This observational single cohort study was conducted on all COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the tertiary care hospital, Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Amritsar, Punjab, India during August 2020 to October 2020. Critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19 receiving 6 mg dexamethasone along with standard treatment protocol as prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) were included in this study. Serum interleukin-6, D-dimer, ferritin, levels along with CT values from RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab were recorded on the day of admission and after 7 days of dexamethasone therapy along with standard treatment protocol of ICMR. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics and paired-t test. Results: There were 22 males and 28 females enrolled in the study with mean age of males as 55 years and mean age of females as 56 years. The mean weight of males was 68.4 kg, while the mean weight of females was 59.8 kg.

Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients become more active, yet little is known about the preparation of primary care nurse practitioners (NPs) to aid in this effort. PURPOSE To examine the amount and type of PA training offered in primary care NP programs in the United States. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study design was used. Eligible programs' websites were reviewed, and an online survey of program leaders assessed details regarding the inclusion of PA training, barriers, and future plans. RESULTS Data extracted from 1,067 NP program websites revealed that 81.7% of websites (n = 264) with course descriptions contained one or more general health promotion keywords, whereas only 0.6% (n = 2) included a PA-specific keyword. Two-hundred institutions (53.2%) completed the program leader survey, of which 45.0% reported no inclusion of PA training. Among institutions providing PA training, 82.2% (n = 88) and 55.1% (n = 59) reported the inclusion of aerobic activity and strength training recommendations, respectively. Forty-one institutions (46.1%) felt that their institution prepared students to effectively counsel patients on starting a PA program. CONCLUSIONS Although some NP programs include PA content, most provide no or less-than-adequate PA training. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The current state of PA training in NP programs may hinder health promotion and disease prevention efforts. Programs should dedicate sufficient time and attention to preparing future NPs to promote PA behaviors.

Second, the findings presented that this miRNA had a considerable role in PI3K/Act, endocytosis, and type 2 diabetes, moreover, it may play a critical role in the prevention of GRP78 production and the virus entering, proliferation and development. Third, nearly 1033 medicinal herbal compounds were collected and docked with ACE2, TMPRSS2, GRP78, and AT1R receptors, which were the most noticeable receptors in causing the COVID-19. Among them, there were three common compounds including berbamine, hypericin, and hesperidin, which were more effective and appropriate to prevent the COVID-19 infection. Also, it was revealed some of these chemical compounds which had a greater affinity for AT1R receptor inhibitors can be suitable therapeutic targets for inhibiting AT1R and preventing the adverse side effects of this receptor. According to the result, clinical assessment of these three herbal compounds and hsa-miR-1307-3p may have significant outcomes for the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Predicted therapeutic targets for COVID-19 disease by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and its related receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globally, the routinely used case-based reporting and IgG serosurveys underestimate the actual prevalence of COVID-19. Simultaneous estimation of IgG antibodies and active SARS-CoV-2 markers can provide a more accurate estimation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering all risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the infrastructure of Karnataka in 290 hospitals across all 30 districts. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence, while multinomial regression identified predictors. Findings: The overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.3% (95% CI: 25.7-28.9), including IgG 16.4% (95% CI: 15.1 - 17.7) and active infection 12.7% (95% CI: 11.5-13.9). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. The RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic participants compared to 47% in asymptomatic. Interpretation: This is the first comprehensive survey providing accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden anywhere in the world. Further, our findings provide a reasonable approximation of population immunity threshold levels. Using the RAT kits and following the syndromic approach can be useful in screening and monitoring COVID-19. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled with appropriate methods and sampling framework, renders our model replicable in other settings.","output":"The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide survey in Karnataka, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied the role of viruses and atypical bacteria in children hospitalized with exacerbated asthma by a prospective study of children with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Pediatrics in Lille, and to 15 hospitals in the Nord\\\\Pas de Calais region, from October 1, 1998CJune 30, 1999.

Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures, and quarantines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020-04/22/2020). RESULTS: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (4 warranting intensive care), and 2 died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1-4) to &#8804;1-day (P < 0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75-5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1-2) [P < 0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3-6.5) through prolonged close contact.

Recruitment of additional attendees and potential attendees was also conducted through a sharable link promoted via oncology newsletters and social media. Descriptive statistics alone were performed due to low COVID-19 event rates. Results Response rates from targeted conference participants with publicly available emails were 27.4% for the ASCO and 14.3% for the ASTRO meetings. The ASCO survey produced 94 responses (48 in-person attendees). The ASTRO survey produced 370 responses (267 in-person attendees). Across both meetings, 3/308 (1.0%) in-person attendees versus 2/141 (1.4%) non-attendees tested COVID-19 positive.

The factors and variables that lead certain CoViD-19 patients to survive this otherwise aggressive and lethal viral infection are intensely researched, as is the development of productive anti-virals and of safe and effective vaccines. Several hypotheses invoke putative mutations of the ss-positive RNA SARS-CoV2 virus to states of stronger or weaker virulence and lethality. Other hypotheses propose that the patient's status of immunity, vitamin D level, Zinc deficiency or other physiological parameters determine how any given patient will effectively weather the viremia and the consequential multi-symptomatic CoViD-19. The initial cause - causa prima - underlying all the symptoms of CoViD-19 is infection of the host human cell by SARS-CoV2.

S consists of two subunits, S1 and S2, which are cleaved by the widely expressed transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) before the virus fuses to the plasma membrane and infects the cell. Current trends show that variant alleles resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2, and genetic variants of TMPRSS2, with putative distinct affinities for S clip, may determine a complex multi-factorial spectrum of SARS-CoV2 virulence across patients, and predict CoViD-19 susceptibility.","output":"CoViD-19 Susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is currently having major short run effects with possible serious long run implications for the environment and the management of natural resources in Latin America.

Mid-term outcomes of the survivors need to be assessed. The objective of this single-center cohort study was to describe their physical, cognitive, psychological, and biological outcomes at 3 months following intensive care unit (ICU)-discharge (M3). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All COVID-19 adults who survived an ICU stay  7 days and attended the M3 consultation at our multidisciplinary follow-up clinic were involved. They benefited from a standardized assessment, addressing health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), sleep disorders (PSQI), and the three principal components of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS): physical status (Barthel index, handgrip and quadriceps strength), mental health disorders (HADS and IES-R), and cognitive impairment (MoCA). Biological parameters referred to C-reactive protein and creatinine. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients admitted to our ICU for COVID-19, 42 survived a prolonged ICU stay and 32 (80%) attended the M3 follow-up visit. Their median age was 62 [49C68] years, 72% were male, and nearly half received inpatient rehabilitation following ICU discharge. At M3, 87.5% (28/32) had not regained their baseline level of daily activities. Only 6.2% (2/32) fully recovered, and had normal scores for the three MoCA, IES-R and Barthel scores. The main observed disorders were PSQI > 5 (75%, 24/32), MoCA < 26 (44%, 14/32), Barthel < 100 (31%, 10/32) and IES-R  33 (28%, 9/32). Combined disorders were observed in 13/32 (40.6%) of the patients. The EQ-5D-3L visual scale was rated at 71 [61C80]. A quarter of patients (8/32) demonstrated a persistent inflammation based on CRP blood level (9.3 [6.8C17.7] mg/L). CONCLUSION: The burden of severe COVID-19 and prolonged ICU stay was considerable in the present cohort after 3 months, affecting both functional status and biological parameters.

METHODS: We performed a sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibody levels of 1558 males and 1499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. The total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: We found that male patients had approximately two-fold rates of ICU admission (4.7% vs. 2.7% in males and females, respectively, P = 0.005) and mortality (3% vs. 1.4%, in males and females, respectively, P = 0.004) than female patients. Survival analysis revealed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for death from COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3C3.6, P = 0.003). The level of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood was higher in males during hospitalization.

By analyzing dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets after symptom onset, we found that the percentage of CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells was generally higher in female patients during the disease course of COVID-19. Notably, the protective RBD-specific IgG against SARS-CoV-2 sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in female patients, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week after symptom onset in male patients. CONCLUSIONS: Males had an unfavorable prognosis, higher inflammation, a lower percentage of lymphocytes, and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery.

After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS: A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency.

Most COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (81%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 63% required mechanical ventilation. Bilateral lung infiltrates (94%), ground glass opacity (91%), honeycomb lung (25%), and pulmonary consolidation (9%) were commonly identified in COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis who survived. The findings for computed tomography and dyspnea scale were significantly higher in severe cases admitted to the ICU who required mechanical ventilation. A higher computerized tomography score also correlated significantly with a longer duration of stay in hospital and a higher degree of dyspnea. Half of the COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (50%) who survived required oxygen therapy, and those with honeycomb lung required long-term oxygen therapy to a far greater extent than others. Cox regression revealed that smoking and asthma were significantly associated with ICU admission and the risk of mortality. Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is a severe complication that leads to permanent lung damage or death.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis: A case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mammals, physiology and metabolism are shaped both by immediate and anticipatory responses to environmental changes through myriad of molecular mechanisms. While the former is mostly mediated through different acute signaling pathways the latter is primarily orchestrated by the circadian clock. Oxygen is vital for life and as such mammals have evolved different mechanisms to cope with changes in oxygen levels. It is widely accepted that oxygen sensing through HIF-1 signaling pathway is paramount for the acute response to changes in oxygen levels. Circadian clocks are molecular oscillators that control 24 h rhythms in various aspects of physiology and behavior. Evidence emerging in recent years points towards pervasive molecular and functional interactions between these two pathways on multiple levels. Daily oscillations in oxygen levels are circadian clock controlled and can reset the clock through HIF-1. Furthermore, the circadian clock appears to modulate the hypoxic response. We review herein the literature related to the crosstalk between the circadian clockwork and the oxygen-signaling pathway in mammals at the molecular and physiological level both under normal and pathologic conditions.","output":"Circadian Clocks' interactions with Oxygen Sensing and Signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and screening of frailty, a condition characterized by an increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes of COVID-19, has emerged as an essential clinical tool which is strongly recommended by healthcare providers concerned with hospitalized elderly population. The data showing the role of frailty in patients infected with COVID-19 is needed. METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study conducted at all hospitals in Turkey. All COVID-19 hospitalized patients (&#8805; 65 years) were included. Patients who were alive and not discharged up to July 20, 2020, were excluded. The frailty was assessed by using the \\"Hospital Frailty Risk Score\\" (HFRS). Patients were classified into three risk groups of frailty based on previously validated cut points as low (<5 points), intermediate (5-15 points), and high (>15 points). Additionally, patients who had the HFRS of &#8805;5 were defined as frail. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rates by frailty group. RESULTS: Between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020, a total of 18,234 COVID-19 patients from all of 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Totally, 12,295 (67.4%) patients were defined as frail (HFRS of >5) of which 2,801 (15.4%) patients were categorized in the highest level of frailty (HFRS of >15). Observed in-hospital mortality rates were 697 (12.0%), 1,751 (18.2%) and 867 (31.0%) in low, intermediate and high hospital frailty risk, respectively (p<0.001). Compared with low HFRS (<5), the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 1.482 (1.334-1.646) for intermediate HFRS (5-15) and 2.084; 95% CI, 1.799-2.413 for high HFRS (>15). CONCLUSIONS: As a claims-based frailty model, the HFRS provides clinicians and health systems, a standardized tool for an effective detection and grading of frailty in patients in COVID-19. A frailty-based tailored management of the older population may provide a more accurate risk categorization for both therapeutic and preventive strategies.","output":"The role of Frailty on Adverse Outcomes Among Older Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diverticulitis is the most severe form of Diverticular disease (). An effective treatment strategy for its prevention has not yet been defined. This review aimed to provide a viewpoint on the role of mesalazine, also note as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), in the prevention of diverticulitis. A systematic electronic search of relevant articles was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open trials, and retrospective studies, published between January 1999 and January 2020, were identified. Twelve eligible studies that analyzed primary or secondary outcomes of diverticulitis were included. The population included patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), or patients with a history of diverticulitis. All studies compared 5-ASA to placebo, rifaximin, or other treatments. Two studies, including 359 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA in preventing the first appearance of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD. Of these, one showed that 5-ASA was effective, and one did not. Ten studies, including 2.995 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with a history of diverticulitis. Four studies showed that 5-ASA had a certain degree of efficacy. All four RCTs demonstrated that 5-ASA did not significantly reduce the rate of diverticulitis recurrence. In a retrospective trial, 5-ASA was less effective than rifaximin in preventing diverticulitis recurrence. In an open trial, there was no difference between 5-ASA and probiotic treatment. Overall, there is currently conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in the prevention of diverticulitis and further RCTs are needed.","output":"Is mesalazine treatment effective in the prevention of diverticulitis?

A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions. However, all approaches require public and policy deliberation about acceptable risks, and continuous careful management and evaluation.","output":"Estimating the impact of control measures to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with air travel into a COVID-19-free country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause a fatal outcome in elderly patients, as this case report illustrates. CASE PRESENTATION: An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4o C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION: This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome. The patient was also one of the earliest admitted with COVID-19 in a Norwegian hospital and marked a new phase of the epidemic, as he had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any confirmed COVID-19 patients.","output":"En mann i 90-?rene med feber og t?rrhoste./ En mann i 90-?rene med feber og t?rrhoste./ A man in his nineties with fever and dry cough"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, several restrictive measures have been put in place that cause significant disruption to lifestyle habits We conducted a review of the literature to study the impact of these changes on the body weight of populations We observed changes in eating habits (increase in the number of snacks and consumption of sugary products), a decrease in physical activity and an increase in stress that can exacerbate eating disorders Increased efforts must be made to support patients during this difficult time, including public health measures to counteract these behaviours in order to prevent health complications","output":"[A double pandemic : the impact of anti-Covid measures on obesity]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E\\\\cigarette or vaping product useCassociated lung injury was recognized in the United States in the summer of 2019 and is typified by acute respiratory distress, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and fever, associated with vaping.

We present a series of CAPA cases at a teaching hospital in Mexico City. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ABC Medical Center from May 1st, 2020, to May 1st, 2021. Including only those with critical COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Patients with a diagnosis of CAPA were analyzed. We followed the 2020 ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria for CAPA diagnosis. Aspergillus antigen testing in tracheal aspirate and serum was done with Aspergillus-specific galactomannoprotein (GP) ELISA (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika). Results Among the 230 admitted patients who required IMV, we identified 49 (21.3%) cases of CAPA, 46 probable CAPA and 3 proven CAPA. Nineteen (38%) of those died in the hospital. The mean age was 64.5  12.6 years and 11 were female. Proven CAPA was diagnosed with culture in three cases (one A. niger, one A. terreus and one A. fumigatus). Probable CAPA was diagnosed by a positive serum GP in 27 (55.1%) patients and by a positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GP in 29 (59.2%) cases. Seven patients had both serum and BAL positive GP. Forty-six (93.9%) patients received corticosteroids, and 22 (49.9%) were treated with tocilizumab before CAPA diagnosis. All but one received isavuconazole as CAPA treatment. We detected 35 (71.4%) patients who had a bacterial co-infection. Eighteen of those died (51.4%) compared to only one dead in the subgroup without coinfections (7.1%). The mean time from hospital admission to CAPA diagnosis was 6.2 days (SD 7.1) among those who survived compared to 13.2 (SD 6.3) days in those who died p< 0.01. Conclusion CAPA had a lower prevalence than previously reported in other series. However, it appears to be linked to high mortality when it occurs with other bacterial coinfections and when it is diagnosed late from admission.

The call for global solutions in international healthcare pandemic outbreak monitoring and crisis risk management has reached unprecedented momentum. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 imposes the most unexpected external economic shock to modern humankind, triggering abrupt consumption and behavior pattern shifts around the world with widespread socio-economic impacts. In order to alleviate unexpected negative fallouts from the crisis, governments around the world have incepted the largest ever amount of strategic economic bailout rescue and recovery packages that particularly focus on economic and social targets. The potential focus of bailouts and recovery ranges from urban-local and national to even global and future-oriented beneficiaries, as pursued in public investments on climate stabilization in the United States Green New Deal or the European Green Deal Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. Large-scale and future-oriented governmental investments are valuable macroeconomic multipliers that can benefit society as a whole in the short run and long term. Economic multipliers trickle down positively in society since governmental spending incepting projects leads to increased salaries, opportunities to support a family and employ other people in the consumption of goods and services, to name a few economic multiplying growth opportunities in the wake of governmental spending. This paper proposes the idea that multiplier effects may vary based on the causes that receive governmental funding. Evidence of country differences in multiplier effectiveness already exist. Multipliers also appear to trickle down in society with a certain time lag. Lastly, multiplier effects can also be negative if the government chooses to cut spending during austerity measures. The discussion proposes potential future hypothesis testing opportunities for investigating healthcare dependent multipliers. Given the enormous amount of governmental COVID rescue and recovery aid in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis and the blatant importance of health in the eye of the pandemic, the time has come to investigate if there is a certain effect of governmental spending on healthcare that influences the multiplier. In order to understand a potential multiplier effect of governmental spending on healthcare, a healthcare dependent multiplier effect could test if healthcare related governmental spending leads to a higher or lower than 1.6 multiplying factor. If a relation between multiplier effects and healthcare exists, a future step would be to investigate if it also holds or varies for particular governmental investment in prevention and preventive healthcare. If there are effects for governmental spending on healthcare, well-being and social welfare are potential moderators of the effect. In the 21st century, healthcare is directly related to digitalization and technological advancement, which could be other moderators to control for. Lastly, corruption has been found to be negatively related to quality healthcare and may also be accounted for in future healthcare related multiplier investigations. The paper ends with an outlook on policy implications of the prospective envisioned research.","output":"Healthcare Dependent Multiplier (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented world-wide effort to gather data, model, and understand the viral spread.

Here, we combine a spatially resolved county-level infection model for Germany with a memory-based integro-differential approach capable of directly including medical data on the course of disease, which is not possible when using traditional SIR-type models. We calibrate our model with data on cumulative detected infections and deaths from the Robert-Koch Institute and demonstrate how the model can be used to obtain county- or even city-level estimates on the number of new infections, hospitality rates and demands on intensive care units. We believe that the present work may help guide decision makers to locally fine-tune their expedient response to potential new outbreaks in the near future.","output":"Memory-based meso-scale modeling of Covid-19: County-resolved timelines in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is considered a safe and effective treatment for severe obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. We sought to examine the outcome of LAGB delivered through a Canadian publicly funded obesity program. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the cases of patients who underwent LAGB within a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, publically funded obesity program. RESULTS A total of 178 patients underwent LAGB. Mean percentage total body weight loss at 1, 2 and 3 years was 15.8%, 20.7% and 20.3%, respectively. The most common short-term complication was postoperative nausea (19%). The medium-term complications included band migration (5.6%) and port site complications, band leakage and incisional hernia at 1% each. The reoperation rate was 4.5%. The mean surgery duration was 56 minutes and the mean length of stay was 1.4 days. The average numbers of clinic visits and band adjustments were highest in the first year. The most common investigation for postoperative symptoms was fluoroscopy (86%). An outcome comparison between the 2 generations of the REALIZE gastric band was inconclusive, requiring further data collection. CONCLUSION Publicly funded LAGB results in effective weight loss and acceptable safety over the short term.

However, major knowledge gaps in Germany complicate appropriate approaches to best address these demands. This paper evaluates available information on the patient group and their healthcare needs from German data sources and derives implications for healthcare planning and regulation by national/federal self-governing bodies, political decision-makers, and specialized providers. METHODS: Based on the concept of needs, we addressed the normative dimension typically characterized by epidemiological data. Based on existing German health system data resources, an explorative approach was utilized to identify and characterize available databases providing information on the patient group and/or their healthcare. RESULTS: To date, no available database provides information on the healthcare needs of this patient group. As of the reporting year 2017, the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics will provide hospital-specific data on home invasive ventilation interventions, but the data do not provide information on long-term care. Claims data may be a promising source for cross-sectoral evaluation of healthcare needs but feature methodological challenges. These results call for efforts to address limited data eligibility, adopt a broader understanding of healthcare needs, and identify actions needed to evidence informed and needs-oriented healthcare. CONCLUSION: Future approaches on needs-oriented specialized healthcare should close the existing knowledge gap based on reliable data. In addition to normative information, they should consider subjective dimensions on a life course perspective and quantitative and qualitative service performance characteristics across multiple sectors and professions.","output":"Healthcare needs of vulnerable patient groups: available data and existing gaps in Germany with respect to long-term mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Universal Health Coverage ensures access to quality health services for all, with no financial hardship when accessing the needed services. Nevertheless, access to quality health services is marred by substantial resource shortages creating service delivery gaps in low-and middle-income countries, including Kenya. The Innovative Partnership for Universal Sustainable Healthcare (i-PUSH) program, developed by AMREF Health Africa and PharmAccess Foundation (PAF), aims to empower low-income women of reproductive age and their families through innovative digital tools. This study aims to evaluate the impact of i-PUSH on maternal and child health care utilization, womens health including their knowledge, behavior, and uptake of respective services, as well as womens empowerment and financial protection. It also aims to evaluate the impact of the LEAP training tool on empowering and enhancing community health volunteers health literacy and to evaluate the impact of the M-TIBA health wallet on savings for health and health insurance uptake. METHODS: This is a study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) study that uses a four-pronged approachincluding year-long weekly financial and health diaries interviews, baseline and endline surveys, a qualitative study, and behavioral lab-in-the-field experimentsin Kakemega County, Kenya. In total, 240 households from 24 villages in Kakamega will be followed to capture their health, health knowledge, health-seeking behavior, health expenditures, and enrolment in health insurance over time. Half of the households live in villages randomly assigned to the treatment group where i-PUSH will be implemented after the baseline, while the other half of the households live in control village where i-PUSH will not be implemented until after the endline. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the AMREF Ethical and Scientific Review Board. Research permits were obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation agency of Kenya. DISCUSSION: People in low-and middle-income countries often suffer from high out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures, which, in turn, impede access to quality health services. Saving for healthcare as well as enrolment in health insurance can improve access to healthcare by building capacities at all levelsindividuals, families, and communities. Notably, i-PUSH fosters savings for health care through the mobile-phone based health wallet, it enhances enrolment in subsidized health insurance through the mobile platformM-TIBAdeveloped by PAF, and it seeks to improve health knowledge and behavior through community health volunteers (CHVs) who are trained using the LEAP toolAMREFs mHealth platform. The findings will inform stakeholders to formulate better strategies to ensure access to Universal Health Coverage in general, and for a highly vulnerable segment of the population in particular, including low-income mothers and their children.

During 1996C2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5 km decrease in visibility at lag 0C1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over.

The aim of this paper is to present the two measures implemented to handle the increased call volume to the Copenhagen EMSfromthose with mild or no relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: This is a cross sectional observational study monitoring call volume in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in accumulated callnumbers, compared to the equivalent numbers during one month from the year before (2019). A coronavirus hotline and web-based self-triage system arepresented in absolute numbers of users. Results: In the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in Copenhagen, emergency medical dispatch centers were extensively overloaded with more than 10.800 calls, resulting in significantly prolonged queue time (mean time in minutes:12:02;CI: 11:55-12:09)) compared to 2019 (mean time in minutes02:23;CI: 02:22-02:25) and thereby limiting access to emergency assistance and triage for citizens. The introduction of the coronavirus hotline showed reduced call volume and queue time to the EMS. The web-based self-triage system was used more than 107.000 times.

We conducted a retrospective observational study of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester, who delivered at Flushing Hospital Medical Centre (FHMC) or Jamaica Hospital Medical Centre (JHMC) between March 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The study participants were symptomatic pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 via positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR) test. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed in the neonate via a SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test, with nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on the neonates after 24 hours of birth. The exclusion criteria for this study were maternal or neonate records without SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test results, neonates not delivered at FHMC or JHMC, and foetuses with suspected foetal anomalies or incomplete medical records.

Our innovative, digital health solution comprises two components: (1) a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care (Brain and Mind Centre model of care) that considers both the heterogeneity of mental disorders and other underlying comorbidities, as well as clinical staging; and (2) a health information technology (i.e. the InnoWell Platform). This digital health solution has been embedded as part of standard service delivery into a community-based intake service, thus resulting in a redesigned service model. The service model is currently being implemented as part of a pilot feasibility study, the marker of acceptability at the health professional and service level, and is now under active evaluation to determine its effect on outcomes for consumers, health professionals and the service. For the purposes of this paper, this model served as a prototype for the preclinic triage system that was conceptualised for national scalability at the primary health network level. When implemented at a national level, our direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system is expected to be an effective population health demand management strategy to address the rapidly emerging mental health demand crisis in Australia, and is aligned with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission to develop a sustainable national digital platform to facilitate the assessment and referral process to ensure access to mental health care matched to an individual's level of need.What is known about the topic?Although there is increased recognition of the mental health demand crisis in Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to 'flatten' the curve. The Australian Government committed additional funding to support the Better Access Pandemic Support measure; however, this approach to care fails to appreciate both the disparities in service availability across Australia and the gap fees that are prohibitive to some of those seeking help. Furthermore, the expansion of this program may only result in those in care remaining in care, thus further delaying access to those in need.What does this paper add?This paper describes a digital health solution, comprised of a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care coupled with a health information technology, that has been embedded as part of standard service delivery. Consumers seeking mental health care complete a multidimensional self-report assessment via the technology, the results of which are available in real-time and used to facilitate triage to pathways of care as indicated by the severity of the consumer's illness and level of need to more effectively and efficiently allocate consumers to care. The redesigned service model is now under active evaluation to determine its effects on outcomes at consumer, health professional and service levels.What are the implications for practitioners?The redesigned local service model served as a prototype for our innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system specifically designed to allocate consumers to self-management, ambulatory care or acute care based on clinical stage and level of need. It is our hypothesis that the preclinic triage system will be an effective population health demand management strategy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients referred to the COVID-A2R pathway after being diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay in a tertiary care hospital ED between January 7 and February 17, 2021. The inclusion criteria were 1) absence of pneumonia but presence of serious comorbidity and/or elevated biomarkers of inflammation, and 2) pneumonia with or without elevated inflammatory markers but without respiratory insufficiency. The main outcome was need for an emergency department revisit with hospital admission and time from ED evaluation to hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were the number of COVID-A2R visits and the potential economic impact. RESULTS: We included 278 patients with a median age of 57 years (57.9% men) and a median Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1. The median time since onset of symptoms was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11 days). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 71.8%, and 64.7% required only 1 in-person visit in the COVID-A2R pathway. No revisits to the ED were needed by 87.8% (83.4%-91.1%) of the patients. Of the 34 patients who were hospitalized, 88.2% were admitted within 5 days.

A set of six primers were designed, based on the G-protein sequence of the VHS virus serotypes (He, F1, 23.75, Klapmolle and Rindsholm). The assay was optimised to amplify VHS RNA by incubation at 63 C for only 1 h, and required only a simple water bath or heating block to provide a constant temperature of 63 C. RT-LAMP amplification products were detected by visual inspection using SYBR Green I stain and had a ladder-like appearance when electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was found to be similar to the commonly used RT-PCR method: both methods detected VHS RNA at a dilution of 10(6). The assay was evaluated using clinical samples and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid, field diagnostic tool for VHS virus.","output":"Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection of viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper takes stock of the cash assistance provided by the government to construction workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the role of the state construction welfare board has been crucial, some existing issues related to boards and challenges emerged during the crisis have also been discussed. Results show that cash benefit through direct benefit transfer has partially helped workers to overcome their financial distress, but 65% workers did not receive any benefit due to various issues related to registration and seeding of bank accounts with Aadhar. Sluggish process of registration has been a major issue which is being addressed by different mechanisms, but results would be known later. Proper cess collection and its utilisation is still an important issue as 61% of the cess collected in 2019 was not utilised. Even during the crisis, 15% cess was used at most in direct benefit transfer and in-kind (food distribution) support. Majority of the states are running a number of welfare schemes, but the coverage is poor despite proper guidelines set under the Model Welfare Framework of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The objectives of Mission Mode Projects are appreciable, but the outcomes are not known even after the completion of deadlines. Above all, the emerging issues of maintaining health and hygiene at worksite and living place and getting vaccinated are major challenges for the sustainability of the construction sector. Hence, a collective effort of the government, employers, and workers organisations is the need of the hour.","output":"Vulnerability of Construction Workers During COVID-19: Tracking Welfare Responses and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Short-acting anesthetics are used for rapid recovery, especially for neurological testing during awake craniotomy. Extent and duration of neurocognitive impairment are ambiguous. Methods: Prospective evaluation of patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection during general anesthesia with propofol (N of craniotomies = 35). Lexical word fluency, digit span and trail making were tested preoperatively and up to 24 h after extubation. Results were stratified for age, tumor localization and hemisphere of surgery. Results in digit span test were compared to 21 patients during awake craniotomies. Results: Word fluency was reduced to 30, 33, 47, and 87% of preoperative values 10, 30, 60 min and 24 h after extubation, respectively. Digit span was decreased to 41, 47, 55, and 86%. Performances were still significantly impaired 24 h after extubation, especially in elderly. Results of digit span test were not worse in patients with left hemisphere surgery. Significance of difference to baseline remained, when patients with left or frontal lesions, i.e., brain areas essential for these tests, were excluded from analysis. Time for trail making was increased by 87% at 1 h after extubation, and recovered within 24 h. In 21 patients undergoing awake craniotomies without pharmacological sedation, digit span was unaffected during intraoperative testing. Conclusion: Selected aspects of higher cognitive functions are compromised for up to 24 h after propofol anesthesia for craniotomy. Propofol and the direct effects of surgical resection on brain networks may be two major factors contributing (possibly jointly) to the observed deficits. Neurocognitive testing was unimpaired in patients undergoing awake craniotomies without sedation.","output":"Neurocognitive Impairment After Propofol With Relevance for Neurosurgical Patients and Awake Craniotomies-A Prospective Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the microblogging service Twitter has been widely used to share opinions and reactions to events. Italy was one of the first European countries to be severely affected by the outbreak and to establish lockdown and stay-at-home orders, potentially leading to country reputation damage. We resort to sentiment analysis to investigate changes in opinions about Italy reported on Twitter before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using different lexicons-based methods, we find a breakpoint corresponding to the date of the first established case of COVID-19 in Italy that causes a relevant change in sentiment scores used as proxy of the country reputation. Next, we demonstrate that sentiment scores about Italy are strongly associated with the levels of the FTSE-MIB index, the Italian Stock Exchange main index, as they serve as early detection signals of changes in the values of FTSE-MIB. Finally, we make a content-based classification of tweets into positive and negative and use two machine learning classifiers to validate the assigned polarity of tweets posted before and after the outbreak.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italy's country reputation and stock market performance: a sentiment analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging porcine intestinal coronavirus in recent years, which mainly causes different degrees of vomiting and diarrhea in piglets and has caused great harm to the swine husbandry worldwide since its report. Selenium is an essential trace element for organisms and has been demonstrated to have antiviral effects. In this study, pig kidney epithelial (LLC-PK) cells were used to study the antiviral activity of selenomethionine (Se-Met) (2, 4, 8, and 16 M) against PDCoV by detecting the replication of the virus, the expression of the mitochondrial antiviral signal protein (MAVS) protein, and the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), IFN-, and IFN-, and the changes in glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity, and hydrogen peroxide content in the cells. The results showed that Se-Met at higher than physiological concentrations (16 M) could significantly inhibit the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK cells and enhance the expression of MAVS protein and the phosphorylation of IRF-3. In addition, Se-Met also improved the intracellular production of IFN/ and antioxidant capacity with increasing doses. These data suggest that the availability of selenium through selenomethionine supports the antiviral response in porcine kidney cells, and the specific mechanism is attributed to the improved cellular antioxidant capacity and activation of the MAVS pathway by Se-Met.","output":"Antiviral Effect of Selenomethionine on Porcine Deltacoronavirus in Pig Kidney Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver resection is used in specialized centers all over the world. However, laparoscopic liver resection has never been compared with open liver resection in a prospective, randomized trial. METHODS/DESIGN The Oslo-CoMet Study is a randomized trial into laparoscopic versus open liver resection for the surgical management of hepatic colorectal metastases. The primary outcome is 30-day perioperative morbidity. Secondary outcomes include 5-year survival (overall, disease-free and recurrence-free), resection margins, recurrence pattern, postoperative pain, health-related quality of life, and evaluation of the inflammatory response. A cost-utility analysis of replacing open surgery with laparoscopic surgery will also be performed. The study includes all resections for colorectal liver metastases, except formal hemihepatectomies, resections where reconstruction of vessels/bile ducts is necessary and resections that need to be combined with ablation. All patients will participate in an enhanced recovery after surgery program. A biobank of liver and tumor tissue will be established and molecular analysis will be performed. DISCUSSION After 35 months of recruitment, 200 patients have been included in the trial. Molecular and immunology data are being analyzed. Results for primary and secondary outcome measures will be presented following the conclusion of the study (late 2015). The Oslo-CoMet Study will provide the first level 1 evidence on the benefits of laparoscopic liver resection for colorectal liver metastases.

However, accumulating clinical evidence have shown that ceramides are playing a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of several diseases including cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes and obesity, collectively referred to as cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, it has become necessary to study in depth the role of ceramides in the pathophysiology of such diseases, aiming to tailor more efficient treatment regimens. Furthermore, understanding the contribution of ceramides to the pathological molecular mechanisms of those interrelated conditions may improve not only the therapeutic but also the diagnostic and preventive approaches of the preceding hazardous events. Hence, the purpose of this article is to review currently available evidence on the role of ceramides as a common factor in the pathological mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases as well as the mechanism of action of the latest ceramides-targeted therapies.","output":"Role of Ceramides in the Molecular Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Strategies of Cardiometabolic Diseases: What we Know so Far"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bikes are among the healthiest, greenest, and most affordable means of transportation for a better future city, but mobility patterns of riders with different income were rarely studied due to limitations on collecting data. Newly emergent dockless bike-sharing platforms that record detailed information regarding each trip provide us a unique opportunity. Attribute to its better usage flexibility and accessibility, dockless bike-sharing platforms are booming over the past a few years worldwide and reviving the riding fashion in cities. In this work, by exploiting massive riding records in two megacities from a dockless bike-sharing platform, we reveal that individual mobility patterns, including radius of gyration and average travel distance, are similar among users with different income, which indicates that human beings all follow similar physical rules. However, collective mobility patterns, including average range and diversity of visitation, and commuting directions, all exhibit different behaviors and spatial patterns across income categories. Hotspot locations that attract more cycling activities are quite different over groups, and locations where users reside are of a low user ratio for both higher and lower income groups. Lower income groups are inclined to visit less flourishing locations, and commute towards the direction to the city center in both cities, and of a smaller mobility diversity in Beijing but a larger diversity in Shanghai. In addition, differences on mobility patterns among socioeconomic categories are more evident in Beijing than in Shanghai. Our findings would be helpful on designing better promotion strategies for dockless bike-sharing platforms and towards the transition to a more sustainable green transportation.","output":"Quantifying relation between mobility patterns and socioeconomic status of dockless sharing-bike users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventing COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients with hematological disease and cancer is important.
