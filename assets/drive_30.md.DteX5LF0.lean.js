The number of countries reporting Variants of Concern (VOCs) with such mutations continues to rise. Here, we investigate two scenarios for third waves of the COVID pandemic: one driven by increased transmissibility, and another driven by immune escape. We do this using three mathematical models: a parsimonious susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic model with homogeneous mixing, an age-structured SARS-CoV-2 transmission model and a stochastic importation model. We calibrated our models to the situation in England in May 2021, although the insights will generalise to other contexts. We therefore accurately captured infection dynamics and vaccination rates, and also used these to explore the potential impact of a putative new VOC-targeted vaccine. Epidemiological trajectories for putative VOCs are wide-ranging and heavily dependent on their transmissibility, immune escape capability, and the time at which a postulated VOC-targeted vaccine may be introduced. We demonstrate that a VOC with either a substantial transmission advantage over resident variants, or the ability to evade vaccine-derived and prior immunity, is expected to generate a wave of infections and hospitalisations comparable to those seen in the winter 2020-21 wave. Moreover, a variant that is less transmissible, but shows partial immune-escape could provoke a wave of infection that would not be revealed until control measures are further relaxed.","output":"Possible future waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection generated by variants of concern with a range of characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identify periods of mildly explosive dynamics and collapses in the stock markets of 18 major countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structural protein on its surface called the S-spike. Further, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell membrane fusion and virus infectivity. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variations of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry related receptors expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and GB make these organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at these ACE2 enriched sites may be a basis for the disease recurrence reported in some, thought to be cured, patients. Based on the human tissue specific distribution of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and other supportive evidence from the literature, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptorACE2 based mechanism in GI tissue may be involved in COVID-19 (i) in the pathogenesis of digestive symptoms, (ii) in increased diabetic complications, (iii) in disease recurrence.","output":"Relevance of SARS-CoV-2 related factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in gastrointestinal tissue with pathogenesis of digestive symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

The high plasticity of the viral receptor due to a continuous modification of the host species habitat may be the cause of cross-species transmission that can turn into a threat to other species including the human population. The successive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in 2012, and the recent SARS-CoV-2 has incentivized a number of studies on the molecular basis of the coronavirus and its pathogenesis. The high degree of interrelatedness between humans and wild and domestic animals and the modification of animal habitats by human urbanization, has favored new viral spreads. Hence, knowledge on the main clinical signs of coronavirus infection in the different hosts and the distinctive molecular characteristics of each coronavirus is essential to prevent the emergence of new coronavirus diseases.

Conventional localization of these small PPLs, which are > 1 cm away from the visceral pleura in operation, is quite difficult. Currently used methods inevitably damage the visceral pleura and may cause a series of complications, such as pneumothorax and hemothorax. Hence, the present study aimed to find out an intraoperative localization method with no damage to the visceral pleura. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 21 patients with PLLs who underwent electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)-guided biopsy plus a new methylene blue staining with the help of massage (Massage Staining) in our department between August 2017 and December 2018. RESULTS The median age of these 21 patients was 51.3  2.1 years. The diameter of the PPLs was 8.2  2.3 mm. The rate of successful biopsy was 76.2%, and the rate of excellent or satisfactory of Massage Staining was 81.0%, while all lesions of these 21 cases were included in the range of staining, and the median distance from the edge of the stained site to the edge of the lesion was 29  18 mm. The duration of ENB-guided biopsy plus Massage Staining was 26.7  5.3 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 3.3  1.5 ml. No pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and tracheal injury occurred intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS The ENB-guided biopsy combined with Massage Staining is an innovative one-stop strategy designed to enhance the precision of thoracic surgery.

The objective of this national survey was to investigate the initial experiences of remote consulting for neurologists and patients with established neurological conditions under follow-up during the first COVID-19 phase. METHODS: In collaboration with the Scottish Association of Neurological Sciences and the Neurological Alliance of Scotland, we conducted a web-based survey of neurologists and patients between October and November 2020. FINDINGS: Data was available for 62 neurologists and 201 patients. The consensus among neurologists was that remote consulting is a satisfactory way of delivering healthcare in selected groups of patients. For practical and technical reasons, there was preference for phone over video consultations (phone 63% vs video 33%, p=0.003). The prevailing opinion among clinicians was that considerable training interventions for remote consultation skills are required (yes 63% vs no 37%, p=0.009) to improve clinician consultation skills and successfully embed this new model of care. Most patients perceived remote consultations as safe, effective and convenient, with 89% of patients being satisfied with their remote consultation experience. Although traditional face-to-face consultations were the favoured way of interaction for 62% of patients, a significant proportion preferred that some of their future consultations be remote. INTERPRETATION: Although not a replacement for face-to-face consultations, this survey illustrates that remote consulting can be an acceptable adjunct to traditional face-to-face consultations for doctors and patients.

Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of MproC using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of MproC folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the MproC domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric Mpro in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.","output":"The Molecular Mechanism of Domain Swapping of the C-Terminal Domain of the SARS-Coronavirus Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines features shared by societies built around oil and the impact of COVID-19 For our cross-sectional analysis, we use epidemiological data on COVID-19, country-level long-run oil production data, and data on petroleum geology for econometric identification We first document that a country's long run oil production is associated with a significantly higher number of COVID-19 deaths Exploring mechanisms, we find that women's election into political offices reduces the risk from COVID-19, but only in oil-poor countries Furthermore, we find robust evidence that petroleum-wealth reduces the percentage of women in parliament Oil contributes to a gender imbalance in the population and affects the labour force market participation rate for men more than for women Overall, these findings highlight the risk and plausible mechanisms of COVID-19 vulnerability in oil-exporting countries Policy makers should be aware of these effects","output":"Patriarchy, pandemics and the gendered resource curse thesis: evidence from petroleum geology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States and elsewhere, risk assessment algorithms are being used to help inform criminal justice decision-makers. A common intent is to forecast an offender's \`\`future dangerousness.'' Such algorithms have been correctly criticized for potential unfairness, and there is an active cottage industry trying to make repairs. In this paper, we use counterfactual reasoning to consider the prospects for improved fairness when members of a less privileged group are treated by a risk algorithm as if they are members of a more privileged group. We combine a machine learning classifier trained in a novel manner with an optimal transport adjustment for the relevant joint probability distributions, which together provide a constructive response to claims of bias-in-bias-out. A key distinction is between fairness claims that are empirically testable and fairness claims that are not. We then use confusion tables and conformal prediction sets to evaluate achieved fairness for projected risk. Our data are a random sample of 300,000 offenders at their arraignments for a large metropolitan area in the United States during which decisions to release or detain are made. We show that substantial improvement in fairness can be achieved consistent with a Pareto improvement for protected groups.","output":"Improving Fairness in Criminal Justice Algorithmic Risk Assessments Using Optimal Transport and Conformal Prediction Sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management of distal ureter by en block resection during radical nephrectomy for upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is considered as standard of care.

These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population, and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of different virus families. A key trait of viruses that spillover from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a pandemic.","output":"A simple model for how the risk of pandemics from different virus families depends on viral and human traits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intrinsically disordered proteins are frequently involved in important regulatory processes in the cell thanks to their ability to bind several different targets performing sometimes even opposite functions. The PentUnFOLD algorithm is a physicochemical method that is based on new propensity scales for disordered, nonstable and stable elements of secondary structure and on the counting of stabilizing and destabilizing intraprotein contacts. Unlike other methods, it works with a PDB file, and it can determine not only those fragments of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils that can turn into disordered state (the dark side of the disorder), but also nonstable regions of alpha helices and beta strands which are able to turn into random coils (the light side), and vice versa (H ? C, E ? C). The scales have been obtained from structural data on disordered regions from the middle parts of amino acid sequences only, and not on their expectedly disordered N- and C-termini. Among other tendencies we have found that regions of both alpha helices and beta strands that can turn into the disordered state are relatively enriched in residues of Ala, Met, Asp, and Lys, while regions of both alpha helices and beta strands that can turn into random coil are relatively enriched in hydrophilic residues, and Cys, Pro, and Gly.

OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients older than 85 years and study risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients aged 85 years and older, admitted in noncritical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisire Fernand-Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included and followed up for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death. RESULTS: From March 14 to April 11, 2020, 76 patients (median age = 90 (86-92) years; women = 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID-19. Of the patients, 64.5% presented with three or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%) and confusion and delirium (71.1%). An initial fall was reported in 25.0% of cases, and digestive symptoms were reported in 22.4% of cases. COVID-19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9%, and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%), and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8-17) days. Males were overrepresented in nonsurvivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9-19.5) days. Independent predictive factors of death were C-reactive protein level at admission and lymphocyte count at nadir. CONCLUSION: Specific clinical features, multiorgan injury, and high case fatality rate are observed in older adults with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: We present a new agent-based model (ABM) called the Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent based Network Transmission model (DESSABNeT) and demonstrate its ability to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast. Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. DESIGN: DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. Reff and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. RESULTS: DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination.","output":"A Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent-Based Network Transmission (DESSABNeT) model for communicable diseases: Method and validation using SARS-CoV-2 data in three large Australian cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to elaborate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Japan, particularly focusing on the country's economic sector.

BACKGROUND: Falls and frailty are main causes of morbidity and frequenty associated with functional performance, balance and physical activity. The restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic force the elderly to spend most of their time at home which may cause further functional problems. Therefore, identifying the risk factors during the pandemic can help to prevent the elderly from frailty and falls. Aim: Our aims are to investigate the clinical frailty profile and falls in relation to functional performance, balance, fear of falling and physical activity and to compare these parameters of the elderly with and without falling history during the COVID-19 pandemics. Method: Thirty-three participants aged 65-85 (mean = 71.33  5.35/years, 20 women, 13 men) who have never had COVID-19 were included in the study. The participants were invited to an online video-conference based assessment. The number of falls during the last year were asked. Clinical frailty severity was assessed with Clinical Frailty Scale. The fear of falling were assessed using Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). The functional performance of the participants were tested with 30 seconds Sit-to-Stand test. The balance and mobility was evaluated with Timed-Up and Go test in a 3 meter corridor. The physical activity level of the participants were questioned using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and vigorous level of physical activity (VPA), moderate level of physical activity (MPA) and walking were also calculated. Results: The mean scores of the outcomes among participants were shown in Table 1. Clinical frailty was significantly higher in women compared to men (p = 0.08). Clinical frailty score, fear of falling and sit to stand performance were significantly worse in fallers. There were negative weak to moderate correlations between frailty and sit to stand performance (p = 0.001) and MPA (p = 0,016). The clinical frailty was also positively correlated with FES (p < 0.001). FES showed positive correlation with Time-Up and Go performance (p = 0.001) and negative correlation with sit to stand performance (p < 0.001) and MPA (p = 0,036). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that; clinical frailty, fear of falling and sit to stand performance were associated with the fall history in elderly. In addition, clinical frailty score were higher in women. Our results indicate that, people who have fall history may tend to be frailer and may have lower functional performance, balance and physical activity. The encouragement of the elderly to increased physical activity and exercise program may decrease the frailty score and falling risk especially in elderly women during COVID-19 pandemics.","output":"The frailty and falling in related with functional performance, balance and physical activity in elderly during Covid-19 pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A safe way of securing the airway with an endotracheal tube is one of the priorities of an advanced cardiovascular life support algorithm for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

Obesity did not affect rates of AKI, ACI, or ARDS. Furthermore, obesity appears to significantly increase the risk of mortality in males (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, P = 0.03), but not in females (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77-1.9, P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that patients with overweight and obesity who have COVID-19 are at increased risk for mortality and intubation compared to those with normal BMI. These findings support the hypothesis that obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications and should be a consideration in management of COVID-19.","output":"The impact of obesity on COVID-19 complications: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus in China in 2019.

These important meetings were integral to patient care, facilitated care coordination, and improved the managed care of the patient. During COVID-19 and beyond, these important relationships should be fostered via digital means. We aimed to identify opportunities of digital health integration for the optimization of physician integration. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Prior to COVID-19, we conducted a survey of PCPs at a large multidisciplinary group with more than 1500 physicians that staffs multiple hospitals within a health system. The survey was sent via email with only 1 reminder. RESULTS: Thirty-six PCPs responded to the survey; 25% (9/36) were very satisfied and 19.4% (7/36) were moderately satisfied with the current in-person introductions. The PCPs found introductions to specialists helpful; 83.7% (31/37) wanted to \\"put a name to the face,\\" and 64.9% (24/37) wanted to \\"understand the range of service provided by the specialist.\\" Fifty-one percent (19/37) and 54% (20/37) said \\"I can better manage patient care and know when to refer to a specialist\\" and \\"I learn more about a particular specialist,\\" respectively, with specialist introductions.

This project assessed aggregate changes in the quality of the evidence supporting these schedules to establish a comprehensive evidence base for future reference and highlight aspects for future study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on a systematic review of published recommendations related to dose fractionation during the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 expert panelists assigned to 14 disease groups named and graded the highest quality of evidence schedule(s) used routinely for each condition and also graded all COVID-era recommended schedules. The American Society for Radiation Oncology quality of evidence criteria were used to rank the schedules. Process-related statistics and changes in distributions of quality ratings of the highest-rated versus recommended COVID-19 era schedules were described by disease groups and for specific clinical scenarios. RESULTS: From January to May 2020 there were 54 relevant publications, including 233 recommended COVID-19Cadapted dose fractionations. For site-specific curative and site-specific palliative schedules, there was a significant shift from established higher-quality evidence to lower-quality evidence and expert opinions for the recommended schedules (P = .022 and P < .001, respectively). For curative-intent schedules, the distribution of quality scores was essentially reversed (highest levels of evidence \\"pre-COVID\\" vs \\"in-COVID\\": high quality, 51.4% vs 4.8%; expert opinion, 5.6% vs 49.3%), although there was variation in the magnitude of shifts between disease sites and among specific indications. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of publications recommended hypofractionated radiation therapy schedules across numerous major disease sites during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were supported by a lower quality of evidence than the highest-quality routinely used dose fractionation schedules. This work provides an evidence-based assessment of these potentially practice-changing recommendations and informs individualized decision-making and counseling of patients.

We identified three compounds with in vitro anti-HAdV5 activities in the low-micromolar range (EC(50) values 0.3-4.5 M, selectivity index values 20-300) that also showed inhibitory effects on HAdV3. Cardamomin (CDM) had good anti-HAdV5 activity in vitro.

Our first aim was to determine both the infection status and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the countrys infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)-PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented to answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 635 people (aged 18C73) providing a blood sample 39.1% reported a history of past COVID-19 symptoms while 14.2% reported having current symptoms of COVID-19. The most-prevalent co-morbidity among this group was hypertension (22.0%) followed by asthma (7.0%) and diabetes (6.0%). The SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was 8.9%. Of the 560 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 participants (0.36%) were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. None of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive people were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. CONCLUSION AND INTERPRETATION: In addition to clinical staff, several patient-facing health workers were characterised within Zimbabwes health system and the seroprevalence data indicated that previous exposure to SAR-CoV-2 had occurred across the full spectrum of patient-facing staff with nurses and nurse aides having the highest seroprevalence.

The goal of this study is to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of AIS and search for new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: Integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA profiles downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was performed. We explored differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMirs) after AIS. Target mRNAs of DEMirs and target miRNAs of DEGs were predicted with target prediction tools, and the intersections between DEGs and target genes were determined. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene set variation analysis (GSVA), competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) (lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA) network, proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network, and gene transcription factors (TFs) network analyses were performed to identify hub genes and associated pathways. Furthermore, we obtained AIS samples with evaluation of immune cell infiltration and used CIBERSORT to determine the relationship between the expression of hub genes and infiltrating immune cells. Finally, we used the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database to predict the effect of the identified targets on drug sensitivity. Result: We identified 293 DEGs and 26 DEMirs associated with AIS. DEGs were found to be mainly enriched in inflammation and immune-related signaling pathways through enrichment analysis. The ceRNA network included nine lncRNAs, 13 miRNAs, and 21 mRNAs. We used the criterion AUC >0.8, to screen a 3-gene signature (FBL, RPS3, and RPS15) and the aberrantly expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-148b-3p, and hsa-miR-143-3p) in AIS, which were verified by a method of quantitative PCR (qPCR) in HT22 cells.

This allows to monitor the effect of public health policies in short term, and to repeat these calculations over time to surveille epidemic dynamics and impact. Our method can help to define a risk-categorization of likeliness to develop a severe COVID-19 disease which requires intensive care or is indicative of a higher risk of dying. Indeed, analysis of suitable open-access COVID-19 data in three European countries indicates that individuals in the 0C40 age interval and females under 60 are significantly less likely to develop a severe condition and die, whereas males equal or above 60 are more likely at risk of severe disease and death.

Assessment focused on five aspects: (i) the political environment; (ii) access to financial resources; (iii) the number of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS; (iv) the scope of work; and (v) the impact of CSO involvement on programmes. Results The number of CSOs specificly working on HIV/AIDS increased from 0 before 1988 to over 400 in 2009. Among a sample of 368 CSOs, 135 (36.7%) were registered. CSOs were primarily supported by international programmes. Government financial support to CSOs has increased from USD248 000 in 2002 to USD1.46 million in 2008. Initially, civil society played a minimal role. It is now widely involved in nearly all aspects of HIV/AIDS-related prevention, treatment and care efforts, and has had a positive impact; for example, increased adherence of anti-retroviral treatment and HIV testing among hard-to-reach groups.

In this study, state-wise COVID-19 data, meteorological parameters and air quality index (AQI) were collected from March 13 to April 30, 2020, which encompass three movement control order (MCO) periods in the country. Overall, total infected cases were observed to be higher in MCO phase 1 and 2 and significantly reduced in MCO phase 3. Due to the variation in the spatial interval of population density and individual immunity, the relationship of these parameters to pandemic spread could not be achieved. The study infers that temperature (T) between 23 and 25 C and relative humidity (RH) (70C80%) triggered the pandemic spread by increase in the infected cases in northern and central Peninsular Malaysia. Selangor, WP Kuala Lumpur and WP Putrajaya show significantly high infected cases and a definite trend was not observed with respect to a particular meteorological factor. It is identified that high precipitation (PPT), RH and good air quality have reduced the spread in East Malaysia. A negative correlation of T and AQI and positive correlation of RH with total infected cases were found during MCO phase 3. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that T, RH, PPT, dew point (DP) and AQI are the main controlling factors for the spread across the country apart from social distancing. Vulnerability zones were identified based on the spatial analysis of T, RH, PPT and AQI with reference to total infected cases. Based on time series analysis, it was determined that higher RH and T in Peninsular Malaysia and high amount of PPT, RH and good air quality in East Malaysia have controlled the spreading during MCO phase 3.

Results: Durlobactam restored sulbactam activity against the majority of the strains tested, with SD exhibiting the lowest MIC90 (8 g/ml) relative to the other single comparators tested; 87.9% of the isolates had SD MICs 4/4 g/ml. The most active comparator was colistin (MIC90 = 16 g/ml). The addition of imipenem further lowered the MIC90 of SD by one two-fold dilution. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential utility of SD for the treatment of infections caused by A. baumannii. If its clinical efficacy is confirmed, SD may be an important therapeutic option for CRAB infections.","output":"Activity of Sulbactam-Durlobactam and Comparators Against a National Collection of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates From Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence suggesting potential association between innate and adaptive immunity in viral-induced acute asthma, there is paucity of data in this area. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN--inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. RESULTS: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p = 0.006, cathelicidin; p = 0.002, vitamin D; p < 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p = 0.009), TLR2 (p = 0.05) and spirometric indices (p = 0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p = 0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p = 0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9 pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p = 0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p = 0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma.","output":"The relation of innate and adaptive immunity with viral-induced acute asthma attacks: Focusing on IP-10 and cathelicidin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need to develop drugs and vaccines to counteract the effects of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and adequately treat the corona virus disease (COVID-19) As these drugs are still under investigation, research also focuses on existing medication with proven effectiveness in other coronaviral diseases The advantages of existing therapeutic drugs that are currently approved (for other indications) are the known safety profile, general availability and relatively lower costs involved in extending the purpose to a new disease Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are drugs that have shown effectiveness in several coronaviral diseases, and are well-known and widely used drugs in transplant medicine The aim of this narrative review is to present the current evidence of CNI in coronaviral diseases, the biophysiology of CNI and to suggest possible ways to study CNI as a new treatment option for COVID-19 We searched original papers, observational studies, case reports, and meta-analyses published between 2000 and 2020 in English in the PubMed database and Google Scholar using the keywords: (coronavirus), (treatment), (MERS), (SARS), (COVID-19), (tacrolimus), (ciclosporin), (cyclosporin) AND (calcineurin inhibitor) We excluded studies in patients with clear indications for immunosuppressive therapy Additionally, we searched in the preprint servers and the World Health Organization bulletin Ten studies were identified and included Calcineurin inhibitor therapy has been suggested to be effective for coronaviral diseases in different settings The results are summarized in a table CNI should be investigated as a first treatment option based on evidence of direct antiviral effects and its properties preventing severe systemic hyperinflammation, as has been observed in COVID-19 with predominantly pulmonary immunopathological changes","output":"Transplant Drugs against SARS, MERS and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last 20 years the clarification of monogenic periodic febrile diseases has led to the independent concept of autoinflammation.

The cardinal symptom is recurrent fever episodes accompanied by signs of inflammation, which in the periodic manifestations alternate with intervals of general well-being. The classical monogenic diseases are also known as hereditary recurrent fever (HRF). Examples are familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1?associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency and mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD, hyper-IgD syndrome).

Design/methodology/approach The paper first describes the recent evolution (quarterly 2020 data) of the Spanish non-financial corporate sector (gross value added, labor cost, capital formation, profits) in the assessment of the vulnerability and resilience of the sector to the shock of the COVID pandemic. Then second, it estimates a probit model to evaluate the EU country effects in the explanation of the different propensity firms in the European Company Survey database to adopt innovative management and organization practices. Findings In the Spring of 2020, the Spanish NFC were still recovering from the great recession (low resilience), and the severe contraction in value-added and profits of the corporate sector in the first three quarters of the year evidences its high vulnerability. The proved complementarity between organizational and information related assets implies that the low endowment of organizational capital of Spanish firms, could be a severe limitation for the advancement toward digitalization.

At the time this article was being written, the number of infected and deceased patients continued to grow worldwide. Most patients with severe forms of the disease suffer from pneumonia and pulmonary insufficiency; in many cases, the disease is generalized and causes multiple organ failures and a dysfunction of physiological systems. One of the most serious and prognostically ominous complications from COVID-19 is coagulopathy, in particular, decompensated hypercoagulability with the risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. In most cases, local and diffuse macro- and microthromboses are present, a condition which causes multiple-organ failure and thromboembolic complications. The causes and pathogenic mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 remain largely unclear, but they are associated with systemic inflammation, including the so-called cytokine storm. Despite the relatively short period of the ongoing pandemic, laboratory signs of serious hemostatic disorders have been identified and measures for specific prevention and correction of thrombosis have been developed.

Recently, a connection between the limbic part of the STN and side effects of DBS-STN has been increasingly recognized. Animal studies have shown that DBS-STN influences behavior and provokes neurochemical changes in regions of the limbic system. Some of these regions, which are activated during DBS-STN, are involved in neuroimmunomodulation. The therapeutic effects of DBS-STN in PD treatment are clear, but the influence of DBS-STN on peripheral immunity has not been reported so far. In this study, we examined the effects of unilateral DBS-STN applied in male Wistar rats with 6-hydroxydopamine PD model (DBS-6OHDA) and rats without nigral dopamine depletion (DBS) on corticosterone (CORT) plasma concentration, blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC), leukocyte numbers, lymphocyte population and apoptosis numbers, plasma interferon gamma (IFN-?3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) concentration. The same peripheral immune parameters we measured also in non-stimulated rats with PD model (6OHDA). We observed peripheral immunity changes related to PD model. The NKCC and percentage of T cytotoxic lymphocytes were enhanced, while the level of lymphocyte apoptosis was down regulated in 6OHDA and DBS-6OHDA groups. After DBS-STN (DBS-6OHDA and DBS groups), the plasma CORT and TNF-&#945; were elevated, the number of NK cells and percentage of apoptosis were increased, while the number of B lymphocytes was decreased. We also found, changes in plasma IFN-?3 and IL-6 levels in all the groups. These results suggest potential peripheral immunomodulative effects of DBS-STN in the rat model of PD.

Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. We find a highly refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the L-A totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon. Thus, Xrn1p appears to co-evolve with totiviruses to maintain its potent antiviral activity and limit viral propagation in Saccharomyces yeasts. We demonstrate that Xrn1p physically interacts with the Gag protein encoded by the L-A virus, suggesting a host-virus interaction that is more complicated than just Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs.","output":"XRN1 Is a Species-Specific Virus Restriction Factor in Yeasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between food insufficiency and mental health service utilisation in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on that, several anticoagulation guidelines have been proposed. We aimed to determine whether anticoagulation therapy modifies the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Methods and Results Patients with COVID-19 initially admitted in medical wards of 24 French hospitals were included prospectively from February 26 to April 20, 2020. We used a Poisson regression model, Cox proportional hazard model, and matched propensity score to assess the effect of anticoagulation on outcomes (intensive care unit admission or in-hospital mortality). The study enrolled 2878 patients with COVID-19, among whom 382 (13.2%) were treated with oral anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization. After adjustment, anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.88). Analyses performed using propensity score matching confirmed that anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29-0.63) for intensive care unit admission and adjusted hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61-0.98) for composite criteria intensive care unit admission or death. In contrast, therapeutic or prophylactic low- or high-dose anticoagulation started during hospitalization were not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions Anticoagulation therapy used before hospitalization in medical wards was associated with a better prognosis in contrast with anticoagulation initiated during hospitalization.

Recently, various computational methods have been developed to analyze the scRNAseq data, such as clustering and visualization. However, current visualization methods, including t-SNE and UMAP, are challenged by the limited accuracy of rendering the geometric relationship of populations with distinct functional states. Most visualization methods are unsupervised, leaving out information from the clustering results or given labels. This leads to the inaccurate depiction of the distances between the bona fide functional states. In particular, UMAP and t-SNE are not optimal to preserve the global geometric structure. They may result in a contradiction that clusters with near distance in the embedded dimensions are in fact further away in the original dimensions. Besides, UMAP and t-SNE cannot track the variance of clusters. Through the embedding of t-SNE and UMAP, the variance of a cluster is not only associated with the true variance but also is proportional to the sample size. RESULTS: We present supCPM, a robust supervised visualization method, which separates different clusters, preserves the global structure and tracks the cluster variance. Compared with six visualization methods using synthetic and real datasets, supCPM shows improved performance than other methods in preserving the global geometric structure and data variance. Overall, supCPM provides an enhanced visualization pipeline to assist the interpretation of functional transition and accurately depict population segregation.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established marker for prostate carcinoma with increased levels of expression in high-grade, hormone-refractory and metastatic disease. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) J591 is directed against an extracellular epitope of PSMA and has been shown to efficiently target disseminated disease including metastases in lymph nodes and bone. Its use as a diagnostic imaging agent however is limited due to its slow pharmacokinetics. In this study a diabody derived from mAb J591 was developed as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer with improved pharmacokinetics for the detection of PSMA expression in prostate cancer. METHODS A diabody in VH-VL orientation and with a C-terminal cysteine was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified by a combination of metal ion affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Specificity and affinity were determined in cell binding studies. For SPECT imaging, the diabody was site-specifically labelled with [99mTc(CO)3]+ via the C-terminal His tag and evaluated in a subcutaneous DU145/DU145-PSMA prostate carcinoma xenograft model. RESULTS J591C diabody binds to PSMA-expressing cells with low nanomolar affinity (3.3  0.2 nM). SPECT studies allowed imaging of tumour xenografts with high contrast from 4 h post injection (p.i.). Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed peak tumour uptake of the tracer of 12.1%  1.7% injected dose (ID)/g at 8 h p.i. with a tumour to blood ratio of 8.0. Uptake in PSMA-negative tumours was significantly lower with 6.3%  0.5% at 8 h p.i. (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The presented diabody has favourable properties required to warrant its further development for antibody-based imaging of PSMA expression in prostate cancer, including PSMA-specific uptake, favourable pharmacokinetics compared to the parental antibody and efficient site-specific radiolabelling with 99mTc.","output":"Design and preclinical evaluation of a 99mTc-labelled diabody of mAb J591 for SPECT imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been reported as a global emergency.

However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with probiotics in healthy older adults have utilized a wide variety of strains and focused on several different outcomes with conflicting results. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to determine which outcomes have been investigated in randomized controlled trials with probiotic supplementation in healthy older adults and what has been the effect of these interventions. For inclusion, studies reporting on randomized controlled trials with probiotic and synbiotic supplements in healthy older adults (defined as minimum age of 60 years) were considered. Studies reporting clinical trials in specific patient groups or unhealthy participants were excluded. In addition to assessment of eligibility and data extraction, each study was examined for risk of bias and quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. Due to the heterogeneity of outcomes, strains, study design, duration, and methodology, we did not perform any meta-analyses and instead provided a narrative overview of the outcomes examined. Of 1997 potentially eligible publications, 17 studies were included in this review. The risk of bias was low, although several studies failed to adequately describe random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding. The overall study quality was high; however, many studies did not include sample calculations, and the majority of studies had a small sample size. The main outcomes examined in the trials included microbiota composition, immune-related measurements, digestive health, general well-being, cognitive function, and lipid and other biomarkers. The most commonly assessed outcome with the most consistent effect was microbiota composition; all but one study with this outcome showed significant effects on gut microbiota composition in healthy older adults. Overall, probiotic supplementation had modest effects on markers of humoral immunity, immune cell population levels and activity, as well as the incidence and duration of the common cold and other infections with some conflicting results. Digestive health, general-well-being, cognitive function, and lipid and other biomarkers were investigated in a very small number of studies; therefore, the impact on these outcomes remains inconclusive. Probiotics appear to be efficacious in modifying gut microbiota composition in healthy older adults and have moderate effects on immune function.

The SNP WUR10000125 (WUR) is used as a tag SNP for this QTL. The favorable (B) allele at this SNP is in low frequency in commercial populations, possibly because this allele is unfavorably associated with an important trait under nonchallenging conditions and, therefore, may have been selected against. Therefore, objectives of this study were to estimate the effect of WUR on traits under selection in commercial lines under nonchallenging conditions and to estimate the effect of WUR genotype of parents on performance of crossbred progeny in a commercial-like environment. Data were collected on 4 purebred lines: a Landrace dam line (D1), a Large White dam line (D2), a synthetic sire line (S1), and a Pietrain sire line (S2). Traits analyzed included total number born, number stillborn, farrowing survival, lactation survival, litter mortality, daily feed intake (DFI), backfat, average test daily gain (TGR), average lifetime daily gain (LGR), and Topigs Norsvin selection index (TSI) value, indicative of overall economic value. Deregressed EBV were calculated for each trait (except TSI) and analyzed within line. In the S1 line, AB and BB pigs had significantly lower TGR (P = 0.002) and LGR (P = 0.001) than AA pigs but also lower DFI (P = 0.004). Conversely, AB and BB pigs had significantly higher DFI (P < 0.001) and AB pigs had significantly higher TGR (P = 0.03) than AA pigs in the S2 line. The effect of WUR on TSI was not significant for any line (P  0.15). Analyses of phenotypic records collected on crossbred progeny of S1 sires and D1  D2 F(1) females showed no significant effect of parent WUR genotype on DFI, backfat, TGR, or LGR (P  0.07). In conclusion, the effect of WUR was nonsignificant for most traits but the magnitude and direction of the effect differed by trait and by line. The favorable allele for host response to PRRS was associated with greater DFI and a tendency for greater TGR in the S2 line, but the opposite direction of effect was detected for the S1 line. Regardless of the effect on individual traits, no significant effect of WUR on TSI was detected for any line. Therefore, selecting for the B allele is expected to result in progeny with increased resistance to PRRS without compromising overall economic value under normal, nonchallenging conditions.","output":"A major gene for host response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is not unfavorably associated with overall performance under nonchallenging conditions in commercial pig lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global health crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic requires effective prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches at a worldwide scale.

People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. RESULTS: The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort.

Based on our results, we have taken efforts to implement virtual group therapy more permanently in our clinic. Our experience provides guidance and a model for integration of virtual group therapy within CSC. PRACTITIONER POINTS: In-person group therapy can be adapted as an online treatment modality for individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Group teletherapy is both accessible and satisfactory to individuals with FEP. Group teletherapy has potential as a more standard and widespread treatment modality within coordinated specialty care for FEP.","output":"Group teletherapy for first-episode psychosis: Piloting its integration with coordinated specialty care during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feeding and oviposition deterrents help phytophagous insects to identify host plants. The taste organs of phytophagous insects contain bitter gustatory receptors (GRs). To explore their function, we focused on PxylGr34, a bitter GR in Plutella xylostella (L.). We detected abundant PxylGr34 transcripts in the larval head and specific expression of PxylGr34 in the antennae of females. Analyses using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording showed that PxylGr34 is specifically tuned to the plant hormone brassinolide (BL) and its analog 24-epibrassinolide. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the medial sensilla styloconica on the maxillary galea of the 4th instar larvae are responsive to BL. Dual-choice bioassays demonstrated that BL inhibits larval feeding and female ovipositing. Knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi abolished BL-induced feeding inhibition. These results shed light on gustatory coding mechanisms and deterrence of insect feeding and ovipositing, and may be useful for designing plant hormone-based pest management strategies.","output":"A gustatory receptor tuned to the steroid plant hormone brassinolide in Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in all sectors of life, especially in the field of education. These changes aim to make the learning process more effective in the pandemic environment. However, it can be challenging, as some students do not give positive responses to these changes, especially those in remote areas. This article aims to identify and report students' perceptions about the effectiveness of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the remote North Tapanuli region of Indonesia. Methods: In this study, data were obtained using an online survey involving 30 students from three levels of education, namely junior high school, senior high school, and college. They are students who the teacher appoints as class administrators; through them, the teacher communicates about everythinglearning activities. So compared to his other friends, they know more about the implementation of online learning during the covid 19 pandemic. In addition, schools in remote areas have fewer students than schools in big cities. So we conclude that this research is considered representative with thirty students as the sample. The data gathered from the survey were analyzed using quantitative descriptive methods. Results: Results show that online learning is considered less effective by students in remote areas; this happens because communication networks and infrastructure do not adequately support them to follow online learning. Conclusion: Teachers need to evaluate how to teach as well as re-design models and approaches to be applied in learning. This can be achieved by adjusting to the students current situation to generate interest and willingness to learn online.","output":"Students perception of online learning amidst the Covid-19 pandemic: A study of junior, senior high school and college students in a remote area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, majority of the outpatient departments have been closed including psychiatry community outreach clinics (COCs). The only way to reach out to these patients has been the newly evolved telemedicine services. Aim and Objectives: The aim of the study is to study the need and accessibility of telemedicine services among patients of COCs. Methodology: The case record files of patients who got them registered in the COCs during January to March 2020 were taken out and sociodemographic, clinical, and contact details were retrieved. A 12-item questionnaire was prepared to know the current status of these patients and information about need and accessibility of telemedicine service for mental health over phone. Results: A total of 78 patients were interviewed. Mean age of the respondents was 43.90 years. The most common clinical diagnoses were neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders followed by substance use disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, including other psychotic disorders. About two-third of the respondents reported that their condition worsened over a period of 4 months after closure of COCs, while one-fourth patients could not purchase medicines due to nonrenewal of prescription. Only 2.4% of the respondents were aware about the existing telemedicine services in the hospital and 100% of the respondents agreed to consult telemedicine services after imparting the information and scope of telemedicine services. Conclusion: Sudden closure of COCs led to worsening of mental health status of already registered patients in the clinics. There were poor knowledge and accessibility of telemedicine service by the respondents. Information, education, and communication about telemedicine services increase the feasibility, acceptability, and accessibility of services.","output":"Telemedicine for mental health during COVID-19: Need and accessibility by patients of community outreach clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate associations among countries self-reported International Health Regulation 2005 (IHR 2005) capacity assessments and infectious disease control outcomes. METHODS: Countries self-reported assessments implemented by percentages as IHR Monitoring Tools (IHRMT) in 2016 and 2017 were used to represent national capacity regarding infectious disease control. WHO Disease Outbreak News and matched diseases reports on ProMED-mail were collected in 2016 to represent disease control outcomes of countries. Disease control outcomes were divided in good, normal and bad groups based on the development of outbreaks listed in the reports. The Human Development Index (HDI), density of physicians and nurses, health expenditure, number of arrivals of international tourists were also collected for control. Chi-square test and logistic regression were applied for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 907 cases occurred in 92 countries. For all diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries (OR = 2.19 for IHR 2016, OR = 2.97 for IHR 2017). Cases occurring in low IHR average score countries had significant higher risk (OR = 7.83 for IHR 2016 and OR = 2.23 for IHR 2017) of having a bad disease control outcomes than countries with high IHR average scores. For only human diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries for IHR 2017 (OR = 2.79). Cases occurring in low IHR average score countries had significant higher risk (OR = 11.16 for IHR 2016 and OR = 3.45 for IHR 2017) of having a bad disease control outcomes than countries with high IHR average scores. The HDI, health workforce density and total health expenditure were all positively associated with disease control outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Countries self-reported infectious disease control capacities positively correlated with their disease control outcomes. While the self-reported IHR scores were accountable to some degree, this approach was useful for understanding global capacity in infectious disease control and in allocating resources for future preparedness.","output":"Are countries self-reported assessments of their capacity for infectious disease control reliable?

This vaccine is stored in multiple-dose vials meant to be administered to 10 recipients with a volume of 0.5 mL for each dose. However, the vaccine vials were overfilled, which allows the administration of more than 10 doses per vial. We have stipulated the preparation and use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using traditional 21 or 25G needles and planned to investigate the immune responses of participants who were administered the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using this technique. METHODS: We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike RBD IgG and neutralising antibody using a surrogate virus neutralising test (sVNT) among adults aged 18C72 years on average of 8.57 weeks (IQR 6.85C8.93) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was the antibody level. The secondary outcomes included adverse events, factors affecting antibody levels, and incidence of COVID-19 infection. FINDINGS: In all, 60 participants comprised 25 males and 35 females. The mean age was 53.70  17.48 years. BMI was 23.45  3.69 kg/m(2).Tests for the neutralising antibody were positive in 60% of the participants (71.4% among males and 44% among females). The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac (anti-spike IgG) level among male and female samples was 111.83 BAU/mL (IQR 73.48C196.74 BAU/mL) and 159.65 BAU/mL (IQR 100.39C371.81), respectively. The positive QuantiVac value of male and female samples was 88.00% and 98.44%, respectively (p-value = 0.382) .A good correlation was observed between neutralising Ab and anti-spike RBD IgG. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving 12-dose per vial injections of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 exhibited high levels of immunity without severe side effects.

While fiction may cultivate our expectations about the probable paths of the pandemic, it also invites us to participate in the creative process of imagining alternative futures.

In particular, pregnancy plots in both novels work to interrogate cultures of paternalism, raising key ethical questions about limitations and violations of the bodily autonomy. Illuminating, in spectacular and speculative fashion, how conditions of inequality and precarity are radically revealed and intensified by a public health crisis, novels like Severance and The Dreamers are essential tools for teaching about-and living through-the crisis of our pandemic present.","output":"What to Expect When You're Expecting an Epidemic: Ling Ma's Severance and Karen Thomson Walker's The Dreamers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper investigates the current psychological state of Chinese tourism practitioners and their career resilience during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on: contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R(0) and growth rate.

Currently, there are no approved pre- or post-exposure prophylactic COVID-19 medical countermeasures. Clinical data suggest that famotidine may mitigate COVID-19 disease, but both mechanism of action and rationale for dose selection remain obscure. We have investigated several plausible hypotheses for famotidine activity including antiviral and host-mediated mechanisms of action. We propose that the principal mechanism of action of famotidine for relieving COVID-19 symptoms involves on-target histamine receptor H(2) activity, and that development of clinical COVID-19 involves dysfunctional mast cell activation and histamine release.

Methods: Four clinical sites recruited 240 participants (aged 4-80 years, HbA1c 5.1%-13.5%). Capillary blood samples were obtained by the participant or parent using collection kits from two laboratories (University of Minnesota Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) and Children's Mercy Hospital Laboratory (CMH)) and mailed under varying shipping conditions by United States Postal Service to the laboratories. Comparisons were made between HbA1c measurements from capillary samples and contemporaneously obtained venous samples. The primary outcome was percentage of capillary HbA1c values within 5% of the corresponding venous values. Results: HbA1c values were within 5% of venous values for 96% of ARDL kit specimens shipped with a cold pack and 98% without a cold pack and 99% and 99%, respectively, for the CMH kits. R2 values were 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. Results appeared similar across HbA1c levels and for pediatric and adult participants. Usability survey scores were high. Conclusions: Capillary blood collection kits, suitable for home use, from two academic laboratories, were demonstrated to be easy to use and provided results that are comparable with those obtained from venous specimens.

Not much is known about the long-term implementation of PA and potential problems that may occur. The potential influence of COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. Methods Online questionnaire survey: 158 patients (5314 yrs, 65% male, 87 yrs after HTX) were included. Recruitment was carried out via HTX outpatient departments, transplant sport associations, self-aid groups and social media. The questionnaire included 77 to 138 items divided into 6 categories and 3 time points (pre heart failure, after HTX before COVID-19, after HTX during COVID-19). The survey was approved by the local ethics committee. Results 88% reported regular PA after HTX (before COVID-19) and 75% had taken up PA within the first year. Patients stated higher level of PA after HTX, compared to the pre heart failure period (p<0.05). Patients who completed cardiac rehabilitation (70%), started leisure-time PA significantly earlier (p<0.05) and with higher frequency (p<0.05). Figure 1 shows the most important motifs/barriers for regular PA and changes over the reported period. Satisfaction with sports facilities was moderate and 39% complained about the need for improvement (e.g. exercise education). 61% performed exercise training without a professional supervision. Exercise monitoring was mostly done using heart rate respond (52%), but frequently no monitoring was used (32%). During COVID-19, patients were more dissatisfied with their level of regular PA (p<0.01) or physical condition (p<0.05) and emphasized the beneficial effect of PA on their mental balance. Conclusion After HTX, most patients try to integrate regular PA in their leisure-time behavior, but complain about a lack of detailed exercise education and appropriate sports facilities.

OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans stress, coping, and guideline adherence. DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers platform for survey research (Amazons Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18C88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least mostly enough money to meet their needs. Respondents locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.","output":"Americans COVID-19 Stress, Coping, and Adherence to CDC Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, it was aimed to examine the work burnout of music teachers during the Covid 19 process in terms of some variables.

Covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Covid-19 is associated with development of hyper-inflammation and/or cytokine storm that together with high viral load trigger tissue damage and multi-organ failures (MOF). Colchicine (CN) is a lipophilic tricyclic alkaloid used for treatment of gout since ancient time. In Covid-19 era, CN is repurposed for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection depending on its anti-inflammatory and broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Therefore, a recent clinical trial recommends use of CN in treating Covid-19 patients. It has been confirmed that inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, lysosomal degranulation, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the main mechanism by which CN produces anti-inflammatory effects. CN attenuates generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with consequent inhibition release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Different studies illustrate that microtubule network is necessary and important for replication of different viruses including SARS-CoV-2 since;intracellular transport of viral particles is mediated through cytosolic microtubules. Therefore, CN therapy is effective in the management of Covid-19 patients when timely administrated through reduction of tissue damage and hyper-inflammations. Thus, the anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory properties of CN might be the potential mechanisms of CN therapy against Covid-19. The review concludes that CN is a potent anti-inflammatory agent for the management of Covid-19;it inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced-acute lung injury(ALI) due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects.","output":"Colchicine in the management of Covid-19: With or lieu of evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine theoretically the best workers layoff/training strategy that entrepreneurs should apply to manage the COVID-19 crisis successfully It also examines the impacts of the Saudi governments emergency measures on firm performance The paper develops a theoretical framework in which the optimal control technics is applied to model the entrepreneurs hiring, layoff, and training behaviors The results show that, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the entrepreneur should first lay off the less productive workers to reduce labor costs As more and more inefficient workers quit and profit increases, the entrepreneur starts expanding his activity and training workers In the long run, only the training activity allows the firm efficiency to grow at a constant rate This finding suggests that the key to long-run economic recovery in Saudi Arabia will rely on training, innovation, and adaptability to the new digital environment The paper also shows that the Saudi government initiative of covering 60% of salaries for the small-and medium-sized entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic will enhance training activities in small-and medium-sized enterprises and improve their efficiency in both the short and long run This policy will also prevent Saudi entrepreneurs from laying off half of their staff ?

The patients were divided into groups determined by anticoagulation treatment at discharge. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression was used for analysing the effect of anticoagulation on the false lumen, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess the association of a patent false lumen with the incidence of reoperation and long-term survival. RESULTS A patent false lumen was present in 81% of the patients. Postoperative anticoagulants were not associated with a patent false lumen (p = 0.48) in univariable analysis. In multivariable analysis, both hemiarch replacement (OR 0.15, CI95% 0.05-0.49, p = 0.001) and the use of betablockers had a protective effect (OR 0.29, CI95% 0.10-0.85, p = 0.023). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival and the composite endpoint of survival and freedom from distal reintervention indicated no difference in outcome between patients in regard to anticoagulation treatment (survival p = 0.43, composite p = 0.82) or false lumen status (survival p = 0.21, composite p = 0.09). CONCLUSION This study could not show negative effects from the postoperative use of anticoagulants on false lumen status, nor that false lumen patency was associated with poorer prognosis. A hemiarch procedure was shown to be associated with reduced risk of false lumen patency.","output":"The effect of postoperative anticoagulation on false lumen patency after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Covid 19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 2020. Brazil emerged as an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with more than 12.8 million cases of COVID-19, including over 325,000 fatalities until April 2021. This study evaluates the survival curve and associated factors with mortality after COVID-19 hospitalizations. Methods: Retrospective analysis until May 2021 from administrative database of 37,462 people. Mortality after hospital discharge was investigated in different groups: presence or absence of comorbidities prior to admission (Charlson Comorbidity Index), age (greater/less than 60 years), sex, mean time hospital stay (up to 13/14+ days) and ICU admission. For survival analysis we used the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test applied to compare curves. 95% confidence interval (CI) and significance when p <0.05. Results: Analysis included 916 patients, mean age 69.1 (95% CI 68.1 to 70.1), 50.0% women (n=458) and 50.0% men (n=458). Hospital stay average was 10.9 days (95% CI 10.1 to 11.7). From hospitalizations, 38.9% admitted in the ICU (n=356). The overall mortality rate during period was 23.1% (n=212), men 24.0% (n=110) and women 22.3% (n=102). Mortality rate during Covid hospitalization was 11.6% (n=106), 10.9% in men (n=50) and 12.2% in women (n=56). Risk of death at any time during the follow-up period was significantly higher when presence of previous comorbidities (p=0.020), age greater than 60 years (p <0.001), ICU stay (p <0.001), and higher average length hospital stay (p=0.001). Conclusions: During the follow-up period after COVID 19 hospitalization patients aged 60 or over, previous comorbidities, prolonged hospital stay, and ICU admissions showed higher mortality. This observed correlation was used to develop a calculator using artificial intelligence to predict which individuals present high risk of death after COVID-19 hospital discharges and to implement models for monitoring and health management.","output":"POSB398 Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves Analysis of Hospitalized COVID-19 Beneficiaires of a Health Care Plan in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with several hallmarks of aging including telomere shortening, which can result from germline mutations in telomere related genes (TRGs).

Automatized high-throughput detection of telomeric FISH signals highlighted lower signal intensity in lung fibroblasts from IPF patients, suggesting a telomere length defect in these cells. The increased detection of telomere loss and terminal deletion in IPF cells, particularly in TRG-mutated cells (IPF-TRG), supports the notion that these cells have unstable telomeres. Furthermore, fibroblasts from IPF patients with TRGs mutations exhibited dicentric chromosomes and anaphase bridges.

Green space patterning is, therefore, a major environmental justice challenge. This research uses GIS approaches to analyze and understand urban green space access of urban communities in the Australian metropolitan areas of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. We calculate indicators to describe green space access in relation to different green space patterns within different metropolitan zones, including the inner urban, suburban, and peri urban.

Our results describe the relationship between population density and green space distribution and patterning in the four metropolitan areas. We find that even cities which are generally thought of as liveable have considerable environmental justice challenges and inequity and must improve green space access to address environmental inequity. We also find that a range type of measures can be used to better understand green space accessibility. Accessibility varies greatly both within metropolitan areas and also from city to city.

While most studies used a questionnaire to assess hesitancy, this study aimed to identify factors affecting true booster hesitancy by examining actual vaccine uptake across time. Method: COVID-19 vaccination database records among HCW working at 7 Singaporean public primary care clinics between January to December 2021 were extracted, with gender, profession, place of practice, vaccination type and dates. Time to booster was calculated from the date of vaccination minus date of eligibility. Chi-square test was used to compare relationship between 1st dose and booster hesitancy, Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test were adopted to evaluate differences in cumulative booster uptake. Multivariate cox regression was used to investigate predictors for timely booster vaccination. Vaccination rate was charted across time and corroborated with media releases pertaining to legislative changes. Results: 877 of 891 (98.9%) primary care HCW were fully vaccinated, 73.8% of eligible HCW had taken the booster. HCW were less booster hesitant [median 16 (5-31.3) days] compared to the 1st dose [median 39 (13-119.3) days]. 1st dose hesitant HCW were more likely to be booster hesitant (OR=3.66, 95%CI 2.61-5.14). Adjusting for sex, workplace and time to 1st dose, ancillary (HR=1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.28), medical (HR=1.8, 95%CI 1.18-2.74) and nursing (HR=1.8, 95%CI 1.18-2.37) received boosters earlier compared with administrative staff. No temporal relationship was observed between booster uptake, legislative changes and COVID-19 infection numbers. Conclusion: Vaccine hesitancy among HCW had improved from booster to 1st dose, with timely booster vaccination among medical and nursing staff.

Portal vein rerouting with ligation of one branch of the portal vein bifurcation (PVL) or embolization (PVE) leads to a moderate liver volume increase over several weeks with a clinical dropout rate of 20-40%, mostly due to tumor progression during the waiting period. Accelerated liver regeneration by the Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) was poised to overcome this limitation by reduction of the waiting time, but failed due increased perioperative complications. Simultaneous portal and hepatic vein embolization (PVE/HVE) is a novel minimal invasive way to induce rapid liver growth without the need of two surgeries. PURPOSE: This article summarizes published results of PVE/HVE and analyzes what is known about its efficacy to achieve resection, safety, and the volume changes induced. CONCLUSIONS: PVE/HVE holds promise to induce accelerated liver regeneration in a similar safety profile to PVE. The demonstrated accelerated hypertrophy may increase resectability.

Through the implementation of a PEWS calculator embedded in the EHR, we hope to improve the accuracy of the recorded score and reduce the time between vital sign collection and final documentation in the EHR. METHODS: Identification of the highest PEWS value in the 24 hours before all unplanned transfers or rapid response activations without a transfer occurred between the period November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016. The accuracy of the calculated cardiac or respiratory subscore based on heart rate or the respiratory rate at the time of PEWS calculation was determined. We tracked the calculation of the time to chart via the difference between nursing documentation of PEWS compared to vital sign collection. Before September 3, 2015, PEWS was calculated mentally by the bedside nurse; afterward, the nurse entered the unique PEWS features into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculated PEWS. RESULTS: This study evaluated 2,409 PEWS scores, 1,411 before and 998 after initiation of the PEWS calculator. Accuracy before the EHR calculator was 71%, and the median time to document was 55 minutes.

However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. METHODS: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. RESULTS: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals' infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. CONCLUSIONS: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume. Thus, it is highly recommended that testing be adopted in combination with measures such as wearing masks and social distancing to better manage infectious diseases. Our research contributes to understanding the role of testing in epidemic control and provides useful suggestions for the government and individuals in responding to epidemics.","output":"A network-based model to explore the role of testing in the epidemiological control of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To reconstruct the local HIV-1 transmission network from 1996 to 2011 and use network data to evaluate and guide efforts to interrupt transmission.

A transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. RESULTS: HIV-1 pol sequences from 339 individuals (52.3%) were highly similar to sequences from at least one other participant (i.e., clustered). A high TNS (top 25%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors (number of unique sexual partners and insertive unprotected anal intercourse (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0455, respectively) and predicted risk of transmission (p<0.0001).

We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties and back again over time.","output":"Spatial and temporal trends in social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence and death rates in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nutritional follow-up as part of the integral attention for patients living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It made necessary to implement a remote monitoring for the care of the patients and to evaluate the outcomes of the changes in the care model. Objectives: To identify the effects of the telemonitoring intervention within the pandemic scenario and the outcomes of the traditional face-to-face nutrition consultation. Methods: A retrospective analysis of health records and the administrative data base of the patient's follow-up, between 2019 and 2020, was developed at the arthritis specialized center of the Santa Fe de Bogot Foundation in Bogot, Colombia. The outcomes measured include the number of visits per year and the proportion of patients who attend their nutritional follow-up by telemonitoring in 2020 vs patients attending to face-to-face nutrition consultation. Differences in the Body Max Index (BMI) and the changes based on eating habits, defined by the quality of food consumption per day, were also measured. Results: A total of 212 patients from 2020 and 179 from 2019 were analyzed;An increase of 61.5% in the number of consultations, using nutritional telemonitoring per year, was identified in 2020 (n=412) compared to 2019 (n=255). In patients followed from 2019 to 2020, 13% (10/77) experienced an increase of more than 2 units of their BMI, while 22% (17/77) showed a decrease;in 2% of patients was not possible to evaluate their current weight;in the same way, 49% (103/212) in 2020 showed a positive change in their feeding habits compared with a 12% (21/179) in 2019. 135 new patients were recruited for nutritional telemonitoring 2020. Conclusion: Nutritional telemonitoring to follow-up patients with RA has increased considerably in terms of consultations per year and changes in the feeding habits.

Here, in 284 COVID-19 patients, we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical, 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.","output":"Longitudinal single-cell epitope and RNA-sequencing reveals the immunological impact of type 1 interferon autoantibodies in critical COVID-19: Anti-IFN antibodies in critical COVID-19 correlate with poor ISG response and upregulation of LAIR1 surface protein in PBMCs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the development of life-threatening COVID-19 are believed to disproportionately affect certain at-risk populations. However, it is not clear whether individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a higher risk of COVID-19 or its adverse consequences. Recurrent respiratory viral infections are often associated with perturbation and pulmonary exacerbations of CF as evidenced by the significant morbidity observed in CF individuals during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The primary goal of this review was to systematically survey published accounts of COVID-19 in CF and determine if individuals with CF are disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2 and development of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using EMBASE and Medline between April 28 and December 10, 2020. Six evaluable studies reporting on a total of 339 individuals with CF who developed COVID-19 were included in this study. RESULTS: We found that although individuals with CF generally experience acute exacerbations of lung disease from infectious agents, COVID-19 incidence estimates in CF appear to be lower than in the general population. However, there are reports of subsets of CF, such as those who had organ transplants, that may experience a more severe COVID-19 course. Potential protective mechanisms in the CF population include pre-pandemic social isolation practices, infection prevention and control knowledge, altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the use of certain medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with CF are at risk of acute exacerbations often precipitated by respiratory tract viral infections, published evidence to date indicated that individuals with CF do not experience higher risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is evidence that some subsets within the CF population, including those post-transplantation, may experience a more severe clinical course. As SARS-CoV-2 variants are identified and the pandemic goes through additional waves of disease outbreaks, ongoing monitoring of the risk of COVID-19 in individuals with CF is required.","output":"Systematic review: cystic fibrosis in the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest and most pharmacologically targeted membrane protein family. Here, we used the visual receptor rhodopsin as an archetype for understanding the influences of membrane lipids on conformational changes involved in GPCR activation. Visual rhodopsin was recombined with lipids varying in their degree of acyl chain unsaturation and polar headgroup size using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero- and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophospholipids with phosphocholine (PC) or phosphoethanolamine (PE) headgroups. The receptor activation profile following light excitation was measured using time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy. We discovered that more saturated POPC lipids back shifted the equilibrium to the inactive state, while the small-headgroup, highly unsaturated DOPE lipids favored formation of the active state. Increasing unsaturation or decreasing headgroup size have similar effects that combine to yield control of rhodopsin activation. Membrane effects persist even after electrostatic influences of charged groups at the membrane are taken into account, and necessitate the involvement of factors beyond changes in proteolipid solvation energy. Hence, we consider a balance of curvature free energy with hydrophobic matching and demonstrate how our data support a flexible surface model (FSM) of lipid-protein coupling interactions. The FSM is based on the Helfrich formulation of membrane bending energy as previously first applied to lipid-protein interactions. Membrane elasticity and curvature strain are induced by lateral pressure imbalances between the constituent lipids and drive key physiological processes at the membrane level. Spontaneous negative monolayer curvature towards water is mediated by unsaturated, small-headgroup lipids and couples directly to GPCR activation upon light absorption by rhodopsin. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate this modulation in both the equilibrium and pre-equilibrium evolving states using a time-resolved approach.","output":"Membrane Curvature Revisited-the Archetype of Rhodopsin Studied by Time-Resolved Electronic Spectroscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Containment limited the 2014 Nigerian Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak to 20 reported cases and 8 fatalities.

This consideration is of particular interest in view of the fact that health systems in many countries must address a growing public-sector deficit and respond to increasing pressures due to COVID-19 and aging population, among other factors. In line with a rapidly emerging literature, we focus on patient satisfaction as a proxy for quality of health care. Drawing on rich longitudinal and cross-sectional data for Spain and multilevel estimation techniques, we show that in addition to individual level differences, policy levers (such as public health spending and the patient-doctor ratio, in particular) exert a considerable influence on the quality of a health care system. Our results suggest that policymakers seeking to enhance the quality of care should be cautious when compromising the level of health resources, and in particular, health personnel, as a response to economic downturns in a sector that traditionally had insufficient human resources in many countries, which have become even more evident in the light of the current health crisis.

Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage.

We aimed to assess the impact of a large-scale COVID-19 telemedicine system on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Brazil. METHODS From March 18-May 18, 2020 we evaluated the database of a cooperative private health insurance, with 1.28 million clients. The COVID-19 telemedicine system consisted of: a) mobile app, which redirects to teleconsultations if indicated; b) telemonitoring system, with regular phone calls to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases to monitor progression; c) emergency ambulance system (EAS), with internet phone triage and counselling. ED visits and hospital admissions were recorded, with diagnoses assessed by the Diagnosis Related Groups method. COVID-19 diagnosis and deaths were identified from the patients' registries, and outcomes assessed until June 1st. RESULTS In 60 days, 24,354 patients accessed one of the telemedicine systems. The most frequently utilized was telemonitoring (16,717, 69%), followed by teleconsultation (13,357, 55%) and EAS (687, 3%). The rates of ED and hospital admissions were: telemonitoring 19.7% (3,296) and 4.7% (782); teleconsultation 17.3% (2,313) and 2.4% (318) and EAS: 55.9% (384) and 56.5% (388) patients.

The highest (H) and lowest (L) values were registered along with scores on admission (A) and end of hospitalization (E). The Brixia score was correlated with the outcome (death or discharge). RESULTS: A total of 953 patients met inclusion criteria. In total, 677/953 were discharged and 276/953 died during hospitalization. A total of 524/953 had one CXR and 429/953 had more than one CXR. H-score was significantly higher in deceased (median, 12; IQR 9-14) compared to that in discharged patients (median, 8; IQR 5-11) (p < 0.0001). In 429/953 patients with multiple CXR, A-score, L-score, and E-score were higher in deceased than in discharged patients (A-score 9 vs 8; p = 0.039; L-score 7 vs 5; p < 0.0003; E-score 12 vs 7; p < 0.0001). In the entire cohort, logistic regression showed a significant predictive value for age (p < 0.0001, OR 1.13), H-score (p < 0.0001, OR 1.25), and gender (p = 0.01, male OR 1.67). AUC was 0.863.

The anxiety associated with dysmenorrhea is a pain-related anxiety which might reduce the efficacy of medication as well as enhance the perception of pain. The present study evaluated the efficacy of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) in reducing anxiety among female university students with primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS In this randomized controlled trial, 88 female university students were recruited from April 2019 to February 2020. Eligible participants were selected by convenience sampling and were allocated into study groups (44 individuals in the intervention group and comparison group) using balanced block randomization. The final sample comprised 78 participants who completed the study (39 individuals in each group). Data were collected using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Subjective Units of Distress Scale, and Validity of Cognition Scale before the intervention and at the time of the first menstrual period after completion of the intervention. The intervention group received EMDR in two individual interventional sessions which lasted approximately one hour. Data analysis was performed using analysis of variance with control of covariance method at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS The results of the study showed that EMDR did not have a statistically significant effect on State-Trait Anxiety of patients with dysmenorrhea (p > 0.05). Based on the Cohen's d effect size of 0.06 for state-anxiety, -0.01 for trait-anxiety, and partial eta square less than 0.059 for both uncorrected and corrected models, the intervention was within a trivial effect. CONCLUSION EMDR intervention did not have a statistically and clinically significant effect on State-Trait Anxiety of patients with dysmenorrhea. Therefore, the efficacy of EMDR in treating dysmenorrhea-related anxiety remains inconclusive.

METHODS Out of 8925 unique NDM-positive K. pneumoniae isolates identified in Poland from April 2015 till December 2019, 126 isolates, including the Tunisian imports, were related by PFGE and blaNDM gene-carrying Tn125 transposon derivatives. Forty-seven representative isolates were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. The phylogeny, resistome, virulome and plasmid replicons were analysed and compared with the international ST147 strains. Plasmids of six isolates were studied by the MinION sequencing. RESULTS A high homogeneity of the 47 isolates was observed, with minor variations in their resistomes and plasmid replicon profiles. However, the detailed SNP comparison discerned a strict outbreak cluster of 40 isolates. All of the organisms were grouped within the ST147 phylogenetic international lineage, and four NDM-1 producers from Tunisia, Egypt and France were the closest relatives of the Polish isolates. Yersiniabactin genes (YbST280 type) were located within the ICEKpn12-like element in most of the outbreak isolates, characterized by O2v1 and KL64 antigen loci. The blaNDM-1 genes were located in double-replicon IncFIIK2+IncFIBK plasmids.

Citizens were forced to stay in quarantine, affecting their food consumption habits and food sector. These impacts have not yet been properly understood. Thus, it is important to describe the consequences of COVID-19 on food consumption habits globally, especially in the context of developing countries, such as Brazil. SCOPE AND APPROACH: In this study, the Brazilian's food consumption habits and perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed, highlighting the food consumption changes and selection of food products. Consumer perceptions about issues related to food safety and food marketing were also assessed. An online survey was performed and data were analyzed by descriptive analysis; independence and per cell chi-square test; and factor analysis. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Brazilians perceptions indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic context (assessed in May 2020) changed their food consumption and purchase. Respondents stated that they are eating and buying a greater amount of food, indicating a perception of a less healthy diet, mainly by women. On other hand, they are prioritizing homemade preparations and fresh food. Moreover, they reduced their shopping trips to markets and are starting to use delivery services and shopping platforms. Basic products of animal, vegetable, and bakery origin are being preferred during this period, in addition to economical packaging and products. Brazilians also indicated that they are more concerned with food safety and hygienic practices. However, at a time when global health is threatened, government agencies must create measures that ensure the food supply and consumer's awareness, in order to guarantee the country's food security during the current crisis.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on food habits and perceptions: A study with Brazilians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The major objective of the China-EU CAI was to facilitate a rebalancing of the bilateral relationship by improving access for European companies to the Chinese market and leveling the playing field for them in China.

BACKGROUND: The contribution of our study is to use qualitative methods to understand nurses' experiences and perceptions of the risk of the contagion linked to the shortage of PPE during the first wave of the pandemic, whose explosive start strained health systems around the globe. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design according to the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal model. METHODS: Semi\\\\structured videoconference interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 29 nurses including staff nurses, nursing supervisors and nursing directors from hospital and community services of the Spanish health system. Interviews lasted 30C45 min and were conducted in May 2020. We carried out a thematic analysis using Dedoose. The COREQ checklist was used to report findings. RESULTS: We identified the following themes and subthemes: 1. Experiences with personal protective equipment: scarcity, inequality, reutilization, self\\\\protection, delegation of responsibility, and gap between protocols and reality; 2. Perception of the risk of contagion: lack of credibility, lack of trust, lack of support, and meeting subjective needs. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of personal protective equipment and inequality in its distribution led nurses to take initiatives to feel more protected. Mid\\\\ranking supervisors were caught between the responsibility of monitoring and rationing personal protective equipment and providing the necessary protection to nurses. The disjuncture between protocols and the available supply of personal protective equipment caused confusion. Lack of credibility, lack of trust and lack of support from management influenced participants' perception of the risk of contagion. Mid\\\\ranking supervisors were often responsible for trying to alleviate fear among nursing staff. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the factors involved in risk perception can be helpful to decision\\\\makers who help protect nurses in clinical practice. These results can help administrators and policymakers because they point to the need for nurses to feel that their departments and centers look after their safety at work.

The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field.

We investigated the link between TTE parameters and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 24 French hospitals were retrospectively included. Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE. Most of these had cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease, and were on cardiovascular treatments. Dilatation and dysfunction were observed in, respectively, 12% (48/412) and 23% (102/442) of patients for the left ventricle, and in 12% (47/407) and 16% (65/402) for the right ventricle (RV). Primary composite outcome occurred in 44% (n = 196) of patients [9% (n = 42) for death without ICU transfer and 35% (n = 154) for admission to ICU].

Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001).

While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers. Owing to the highly linear light output of the luciferase reporter, some antibodies can be detected without serum dilution in a dynamic range of detection often spanning seven orders of magnitude. When LIPS is applied iteratively with multiple target antigens, a high-definition antibody profile is obtained. Here, we discuss the application of these different antibody-profiling technologies and their associated limitations with particular emphasis on protein microarrays. We also describe LIPS in detail and discuss several clinically relevant uses of the technology.

METHODS: CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: All 187 patients' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or \\"white lung\\". The CT imaging features in 185 cases (98.9%) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis. The imaging features of 6 times of lung CT examination in one case showed continuous progress.

In addition, instructional lab kits must demonstrate foundational engineering phenomena while maintaining measurement accuracy and fidelity at reasonable cost. In the energy-thermal-fluid sciences, achieving these conditions presents challenges as kits require energy and matter transport and conversion in real time at scales large enough to reveal measurable phenomena but not so large as to become hazardous to users. This paper presents theoretical underpinning and experimental verification of a fluid mechanics lab experiment appropriate for undergraduate engineering students that 1) meets all the above-described criteria, 2) costs less than $30 in materials, and 3) can be easily mailed to remote learners.","output":"A Fluids Experiment for Remote Learners to Test the Unsteady Bernoulli Equation Using a Burette"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic medicine used in the treatment of several types of cancer and inflammatory diseases. It exhibits several drawbacks especially on highly dividing and developing cells. This study aimed to assess the role of Opuntia ficus indica ethanolic extract on testicular damage induced by MTX in rat. MTX was administrated for 10 days (20 mg/kg). Extract of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus indica) was given to MTX-treated rats (0.4 g/kg). Spermatozoa were collected from cauda epididymis and analyzed for sperm count and motility. Testis samples were used for histopathological and oxidative stress studies (assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, protein carbonyls (PCs), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities). Moreover, levels of testosterone were measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. Our results showed that MTX had destructive effects on sperm count and motility associated with significant decrease in testosterone levels in MTX group. This effect was then confirmed by docking results. Testis of MTX group showed increased oxidative stress status. In fact, PCs and MDA were increased and CAT, GPx and SOD were decreased suggesting increased reactive oxygen species and deficiency in enzymatic antioxidant. These findings were associated with disrupted testicular morphology as assessed by histological study. Cladodes extract had protective effects on rat's gonad histology, oxidative stress and improve both sperm parameters (count and motility) and serum testosterone levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that Opuntia ficus indica cladodes extract improved MTX-induced testicular injury and possess potent fertility boosting effects in rats.

The outcomes of anterior versus posterior circulation thrombectomy for LVOs were compared at a high volume center employing a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT). METHODS We retrospectively studied a database of AIS cases that underwent ADAPT thrombectomy for LVOs. Cases were grouped by anatomical location of thrombectomy (posterior vs anterior circulation), and analysis was performed on both entire sample size. RESULTS A total of 436 AIS patients (50.2% women, mean age 67.3 years) underwent ADAPT thrombectomy for LVO during the study period, of whom 13% of had posterior circulation thrombectomy. Patients with posterior circulation thrombectomy did not show a significant difference in preprocedural variables, including age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and onset to groin time, compared with anterior circulation (P>0.05). There were also no differences in procedural variables between the two groups. Patients in the posterior group were found to have a similar likelihood of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) at 90 days compared with the anterior group (42.9% vs 43.2%, respectively), and a small but not significant increase in mortality at 90 days. Multilogistic regression analysis showed that the anatomical location (anterior vs posterior) was not an independent predictor of good outcome or mortality after thrombectomy. Prominent predictors of outcome/mortality included age, female gender, procedure time, and baseline NIHSS. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that when patients are carefully selected for thrombectomy, those with posterior circulation LVOs can achieve similar outcomes compared with anterior circulation thrombectomy, indicating comparable safety and efficacy profiles.","output":"Equivalent favorable outcomes possible after thrombectomy for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion compared with the anterior circulation: the MUSC experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought a global public health crisis.

In total, 2351 and 2073 proteins were identified and quantified in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, respectively. RESULTS: Among them, 92 differentiated expressed proteins (DEPs) (46 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated) were found with a fold change >1.5 or <0.67 and a p-value <0.05, and 375 proteins were uniquely present in airway mucus from COVID-19 patients. Pathway and network enrichment analyses revealed that the 92 DEPs were mostly associated with metabolic, complement and coagulation cascades, lysosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways, and the 375 COVID-19 only proteins were mainly enriched in amino acid degradation (Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine degradation), amino acid metabolism (beta-Alanine, Tryptophan, Cysteine and Methionine metabolism), oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways.

Experimental results using the patient cohort collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) showed that the proposed COVID-Net CT-S networks, by leveraging volumetric features, can achieve significantly improved severity assessment performance when compared to traditional severity assessment networks that learn and leverage 2D visual features to characterize COVID-19 severity.","output":"COVID-Net CT-S: 3D Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for COVID-19 Severity Assessment using Chest CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frailty among older adults is common, especially those who have undergone breast cancer treatment; however, we do not know how frailty among this group presented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to examine self-reported frailty among older breast cancer survivors (BCS) during the pandemic. This IRB-approved study recruited BCS who were at least 1-year post-treatment and 60 years of age or older, via online advertisements (e.g., Dr. Susan Love Foundation). BCS completed demographic and Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) RedCap questionnaires from 11/2020 to 05/2021. The TFI, is a 15-item measure with 3 sub-scales with published cut points indicating frailty: total (5), physical (3), psychological (2), and social (2). Descriptive statistics were used. Older BCS (n=203) who were on average 65.5 (SD=4.7) years of age, white (93.6%; n=190) and had stage II breast cancer at diagnosis (39.9%; n=81) participated.

However, SMEs have been struggling to sustain their performance in a highly competitive environment. Thus, this study aims to re-examine the effect of SMEs' entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on firms' performance during the COVID-19. This study has also studied the moderating role of social media usage and the mediating role of marketing capabilities and social media usage. Design/methodology/approach This study used a structured questionnaire for data collection, where the unit of analysis was the manager or owner of SMEs. The data were analyzed using partial least square-structural equation modeling. Findings The findings show that an EO has a significant and positive effect on an SME's performance, but the outcomes are conditional on the role of social media and marketing capabilities. The empirical results reveal that marketing capabilities significantly mediate the relationship between EO and SME performance. In addition, social media usage moderates the relationship between EO and SME performance and it also partially mediates the EO-performance nexus of SMEs. Finally, this study discovers that the EO-Performance nexus of SMEs is serially mediated by social media usage and marketing capabilities. Research limitations/implications This study has important implications for SMEs that are seeking to gain a competitive advantage. For example, an SME should deploy market activities through social media channels. In situations such as a pandemic and uncertainty, this could be the most effective tool. Originality/value This study builds a theory-based mediation-moderation model to explain the link between EO and SME performance. In explaining mediation-moderation effects, the current study provides insight into EO-performance relationships. Moreover, the current model facilitates exploring whether serial mediation passes through social media usage and market capabilities. Therefore, with new findings, the study extends the literature on serial mediation in the EO-performance of SMEs. Additionally, this study extends the literature on the moderating role of social media on SMEs in Indonesia, which has not been investigated.

We found that one bacterial community reduced infection symptoms after 3 cycles, which was chosen to subsequently isolate bacteria through limiting dilution. All 94 isolates were tested in an in vitro and in planta assay, and a selection of 14 isolates was further tested on detached ears.

Erwinia persicina isolate C3 showed a significant reduction in disease severity (Fv/Fm), and Erwinia persicina C3 and Pseudomonas sp. B3 showed a significant reduction in fungal biomass (cGFP). However, the mycotoxin analysis of both these treatments showed no reduction in DON levels. Nevertheless, Pantoea ananatis H3 and H11 and Erwinia persicina H2 were able to reduce DON concentrations by more than 50%, although these effects were not statistically significant. Lastly, Erwinia persicina H2 also showed a significantly greater glucosylation of DON to the less phytotoxic DON-3G.

As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Understanding the phase separation characteristics of nucleocapsid protein provides a new therapeutic opportunity against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the major pandemic throughout the globe and its occurrence is due to the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).

However, it also provided new opportunities for arts and cultural engagement through virtual activities and streamed performances. Yet it remains unclear (i) who was likely to engage with the arts at home during lockdown, (ii) how this engagement differed from patterns of arts engagement prior to COVID-19, and (iii) whether home-based arts engagement was related to peoples ability to cope with their emotions during lockdown. This study was therefore designed to address these questions. METHODS: We used data collected in late May from the United Kingdom COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London. Multivariate regressions were used for the analysis (N = 19,384). Identified factors included demographic factors, socio-economic position, psychosocial wellbeing and health conditions, adverse events/worries, and coping styles. RESULTS: Four types of home-based arts engagement were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic: digital arts and writing, musical activities, crafts, and reading for pleasure. Our results show that the strongest predictors of the engagement were age, education attainment, social support, and emotion-focused or supportive coping styles. In particular, younger adults (aged 18C29), non-keyworkers, people with greater social support, people who had lost work, those who were worried about catching the virus, and those with an emotion-focused, problem-focused or supportive coping style were more likely to have increased arts engagement during lockdown. Arts activities were used as approach and avoidance strategies to help cope with emotions, as well as to help improve self-development. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study suggests that while some people who engaged in the arts during the COVID-19 pandemic were those who typically engage under normal circumstances, the pandemic has also created new incentives and opportunities for others to engage virtually.

The rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines during the cytokine storm induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to an increase in kynurenine that activates the AhR, thereby heightening the initial pro-inflammatory cytokine phase and suppressing the endogenous anti-viral response. Such AhR-driven changes underpin the heightened severity and fatality associated with pre-existent high-risk medical conditions, such as type II diabetes, as well as to how racial discrimination stress contributes to the raised severity/fatality in people from the Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities.

Methods: We used a transmission model of COVID-19 with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states calibrated to outbreak data from the Diamond Princess, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. Data available included the date of symptom onset for symptomatic disease for passengers and crew, the number of symptom agnostic tests done each day, and date of positive test for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Findings: On the Diamond Princess 74% (70-78%) of infections proceeded asymptomatically, i.e. a 1:3.8 case-to-infection ratio. Despite the intense testing 53%, (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. While the data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, assuming no or low infectiousness resulted in posterior estimates for the net reproduction number of an individual progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in excess of 15.

During follow-up, one mass progressed to T3 on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI for radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 (p > .99, ICC = 1). CONCLUSION. In this study, size measurements on unenhanced T2-weighted MRI had near perfect correlation to measurements using CE-MRI in cT1a solid renal masses undergoing surveillance, with high agreement between and within observers. Clinical staging did not differ comparing T2-weighted MRI and CE-MRI, with near perfect agreement.

During 2004-2018, an average of 702 heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually. To study patterns in heat-related deaths by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of urbanization, and to explore comorbid conditions associated with deaths resulting from heat exposure, CDC analyzed nationally comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).* The rate of heat-related mortality tended to be higher among males, persons aged 65 years, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons living in noncore nonmetropolitan and large central metropolitan counties. Natural heat exposure was a contributing cause of deaths attributed to certain chronic medical conditions and other external causes. Preparedness and response initiatives directed toward extreme heat events, currently underway at local, state, and national levels, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with natural heat exposure. Successful public health interventions? to mitigate heat-related deaths include conducting outreach to vulnerable communities to increase awareness of heat-related symptoms and provide guidance for staying cool and hydrated, particularly for susceptible groups at risk such as young athletes and persons who are older or socially isolated (2). Improved coordination across various health care sectors could inform local activities to protect health during periods of high heat. For instance, jurisdictions can monitor weather conditions and syndromic surveillance data to guide timing of risk communication and other measures (e.g., developing and implementing heat response plans, facilitating communication and education activities) to prevent heat-related mortality in the United States. CDC also recommends that federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions open cooling centers or provide access to public locations with air conditioning for persons in need of a safe, cool, environment during hot weather conditions. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC updated its guidance on the use of cooling centers to provide best practices (e.g., potential changes to staffing procedures, separate areas for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk for introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into cooling centers..","output":"Heat-Related Deaths  United States, 2004C2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The addiction to illicit opioid and the misuse of prescription synthetic opioids pain relievers and fentanyl analogs generated an opioid epidemic in North America over the last two decades that affected public health with a constantly rising number of overdoses deaths.

RESULTS: Within the Duke University Health System, there was a 33.1% decrease in the number of outpatient cardiovascular visits conducted in the first 15 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the same time period in 2019. As a proportion of total visits initially booked, 53% of visits were cancelled in 2020 compared to 35% in 2019. However, patients with cancelled visits had similar demographics and comorbidities in 2019 and 2020. Telehealth visits comprised 9.3% of total visits initially booked in 2020, with younger and healthier patients utilizing telehealth compared with those utilizing in-person visits. Compared with in-person visits in 2020, telehealth visits were associated with fewer new (31.6% for telehealth vs 44.6% for in person) or refill (12.9% vs 15.6%, respectively) medication prescriptions, electrocardiograms (4.3% vs 31.4%), laboratory orders (5.9% vs 21.8%), echocardiograms (7.3% vs 98%), and stress tests (4.4% vs 6.6%).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate COVID-19 impact on colorectal cancer services globally and identify predictors for behaviour change. DESIGN: An online survey of colorectal cancer service change globally in May and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Attending or consultant surgeons involved in the care of patients with colorectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the delivery of diagnostics (diagnostic endoscopy), imaging for staging, therapeutics and surgical technique in the management of colorectal cancer. Predictors of change included increased hospital bed stress, critical care bed stress, mortality and world region. RESULTS: 191 responses were included from surgeons in 159 centers across 46 countries, demonstrating widespread service reduction with global variation. Diagnostic endoscopy was reduced in 93% of responses, even with low hospital stress and mortality; whilst rising critical care bed stress triggered complete cessation (p = 0.02). Availability of CT and MRI fell by 40-41%, with MRI significantly reduced with high hospital stress. Neoadjuvant therapy use in rectal cancer changed in 48% of responses, where centers which had ceased surgery increased its use (62 vs 30%, p = 0.04) as did those with extended delays to surgery (p<0.001). High hospital and critical care bed stresses were associated with surgeons forming more stomas (p<0.04), using more experienced operators (p<0.003) and decreased laparoscopy use (critical care bed stress only, p<0.001). Patients were also more actively prioritized for resection, with increased importance of co-morbidities and ICU need.

The aims of this study were to determine: 1) the factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and 2) sex differences in the factors associated with PTSS in adults residing in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Study participants aged 18 years and above, were recruited for this cross-sectional study through an online survey implemented from June 29, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The outcome variable was PTSS; explanatory variables were sex at birth, COVID-19 status, social isolation and access to emotional support. Confounders considered were age, education level completed and current work status. Logistic regressions were used to determine the association between the outcome and explanatory variables after adjusting for confounders. OUTCOMES: There were 489 respondents. Among all respondents, those who were older (AOR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95 C 0.99) and had access to emotional support from family and relatives (AOR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14 C 0.53) had significantly lower odds of PTSS. Respondents who felt socially isolated had higher odds of PTSS (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08 C 1.27). Females had higher PTSS scores and higher odds of PTSS compared to males (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.41-3.39). Females (AOR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 C 0.95) and males (AOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.59) who had access to emotional support had significantly lower odds of PTSS than those who had no support.

METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (&#8805; 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age &#8805; 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups.

Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals).

Proportional odds logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between age group and perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, impact, and health behavior efficacy and adoption. Structural equation modeling based on HBM constructs examined the relationships between health beliefs and behaviors. Data from 820 participants (Ontario, Canada) were analyzed (age: 42.7, 16.2 years;79% women). Middle-aged and older adults reported greater concerns about the personal risk of hospitalization and mortality, economic impact, and social impact of COVID-19 than young adults. Middle-aged adults also reported greatest concern for other age groups. Adoption and perceived efficacy of health behaviors was similar across age groups with few exceptions. Both middle-aged and older-adults were more likely to perceive their own and each other's age groups as responding adequately to COVID-19 compared to young adults. Structural equation modeling indicated perceived benefits of health behaviors were the primary driver of behavior uptake, with socioeconomic factors and perceived severity and susceptibility indirectly associated with uptake through their influence on perceived benefits. Overall, these results suggest adoption of health behaviors is very high with few differences between age groups, despite differences in perceived impact of COVID-19.

We report here a comparison of COVIDSeq performance for SARS-CoV-2 genome reporting using the ARTIC V3 based primer pool (including primers for human control genes) that is provided with the COVIDSeq kit versus the ARTIC V4 based Illumina COVIDSeq V4 primer pool, using an optimized protocol and DRAGEN COVID Lineage App analysis. The data indicates that both primer pools enable robust reporting of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The Illumina COVIDSeq V4 primer pool has superior performance for SARS-CoV-2 genome reporting, particularly in samples with low virus load, and is therefore the recommended primer pool for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 for research use using COVIDSeq.","output":"Evaluation of an optimized protocol and Illumina ARTIC V4 primer pool for sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq? and DRAGEN?

A comparison between the S2 subunit sequence of chicken embryo kidney cell (CEK) adapted virulent QX-like IBV strain SczyC30 (hereafter referred to as zy30) and its CEK-attenuated strain, SczyC100, revealed an N1038S substitution in S2 subunit and a (1154)EQTRPKKSV(1162) residue deletion in the C-terminus of the S2 subunit. In order to explore whether these two mutations are related to changes in the biological characteristics of IBV, we firstly constructed an infectious clone of zy30 using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), which combines the transcription of infectious IBV genomic RNA in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells with the amplification of rescued virus rzy30 in CEK cells. Then, three recombinant viruses, including an rzy30S2-N1038S strain that contained the N1038S substitution, an rzy30S2-CT9() strain that contained the (1154)EQTRPKKSV(1162) deletion, and an rzy30S2-N1038S-CT9() strain that contained both mutations, were constructed using rescued virus rzy30 as the backbone. The results showed that each mutation did not significantly affect the replication titer in CEK cells but reduced pathogenicity in chickens, while in combination, the N1038S substitution and (1154)EQTRPKKSV(1162) deletion improved the proliferation efficiency in CEK cells and reduced pathogenicity, compared to rzy30 strain. The contribution made by the (1154)EQTRPKKSV(1162) deletion in reducing pathogenicity was higher than that of N1038S substitution. Our results revealed that the N1038S substitution and (1154)EQTRPKKSV(1162) deletion in S2 subunit were deeply involved in the replication efficiency of IBV and contributed to reduction of viral pathogenicity.","output":"The N1038S Substitution and (1153)EQTRPKKSV(1162) Deletion of the S2 Subunit of QX-Type Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus Can Synergistically Enhance Viral Proliferation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This one-year pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a multimedia campaign, Heart Healthy U (HHU), to increase awareness about the link between unhealthy behaviors and risk for heart disease among emerging adults on a college campus. This paper describes the implementation of HHU. Participants: The HHU campaign was implemented from the Fall of 2019 through Spring 2020 and during this time there were approximately 15,043 enrolled students at the south eastern U.S. college campus. Methods: The HHU campaign employed print (e.g., banners, posters, and yard signs) and electronic formats (e.g., email, Instagram). We designed the methods across three phases: (1) relationship building and formative research, (2) campaign development, and (3) the Heart Healthy U campaign launch. Results: The HHU encountered challenges when the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-co-V2) interrupted campus life, however we relied on the electronic formats to reach students during the state-wide lockdown/quarantine mandates. In addition, there were two changes to the HHU health messages. First, we updated the health messages to illustrate that eating healthy and engaging in physical activity supports immune function. Next, we developed new health messages to address effects of physical isolation and anxiety by promoting psychological well-being during this historic public health crisis. Conclusions: We asked whether a multimedia campaign on a college campus could encourage emerging adults to consume fruits and vegetables and engage in physical activity according to the federally-recommended guidelines. It is essential that interventions intended to reach today's emerging adults be presented in formats that they use (e.g., social media platforms), supported by campus administrators, and endorsed by peer influencers. In conclusion, more intervention studies are needed to counter the unhealthy social norm behaviors common to college campus life that increase heart disease risk, particularly among marginalized populations.","output":"Lessons learned: Implementing and adapting a multimedia campaign to promote heart health to college students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increased demand for physiologically relevant in vitro human skin models for testing pharmaceutical drugs has led to significant advancements in skin engineering. One of the most promising approaches is the use of in vitro microfluidic systems to generate advanced skin models, commonly known as skin-on-a-chip (SoC) devices. These devices allow the simulation of key mechanical, functional and structural features of the human skin, better mimicking the native microenvironment. Importantly, contrary to conventional cell culture techniques, SoC devices can perfuse the skin tissue, either by the inclusion of perfusable lumens or by the use of microfluidic channels acting as engineered vasculature. Moreover, integrating sensors on the SoC device allows real-time, non-destructive monitoring of skin function and the effect of topically and systemically applied drugs. In this Review, the major challenges and key prerequisites for the creation of physiologically relevant SoC devices for drug testing are considered. Technical (e.g., SoC fabrication and sensor integration) and biological (e.g., cell sourcing and scaffold materials) aspects are discussed.

During the same time period, total number of U.S. hospital admissions for a mental health (MH) crisis has increased by 12.2%, with rural counties demonstrating the largest suicide rate increases overall. Introduction: Increasing number of rural patients are reporting need for MH care in the region's four rural EDs. Characteristics of ED telemental health services were evaluated, including MH diagnostic category, voluntary vs. involuntary commitment (IC), forensic vs. nonforensic presentation, ED throughput, disposition, and payor reimbursement. Materials and Methods: Observational 2.5-year program evaluation of telemental health care delivery for children (n = 114) and adults (n = 417) who were evaluated by a rural ED physician and received an MH diagnosis. Participants (N = 531) were treated by a licensed psychiatrist through telemental care delivery from September 2017 to April 2020. Results: Noncommitted ED MH patients (86%; n = 455) were distributed across three major diagnostic groups: (1) depression, anxiety, or other mental illness (35%); (2) substance abuse (33%); or (3) suicide risk (32%), with 47% admitted inpatients (IPs), 47% referred outpatient (OPs), and 6% admitted to CAH. Fourteen percent (n = 76/531) of ED MH patients were subsequently IC, with 67% of those assessed as needing IP care. Forty-nine percent (n = 37) of IC patients presented in police custody. Most common diagnosis for IC patients was suicidal ideation/attempt ((2) [2, N = 452] = 12.884, p = 0.002). Admitted patients experienced significantly longer length of stay than those with OP referral (p = 0.001). Mean total payor reimbursements for ED MH care were significantly lower than actual ED costs (p < 0.001). Discussion: Innovative approaches to telemental care for IC and non-IC patients need to be piloted and comparatively evaluated in rural CAHs. Conclusion: As the gateway to critically needed MH care, rural CAHs and public services pivotal to care access (e.g., law enforcement) need additional resources and support.","output":"An Observational Study of Telemental Care Delivery and the Context for Involuntary Commitment for Mental Health Patients in a Group of Rural Emergency Departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis is the most important cause of acquired gastrointestinal morbidity or mortality among low birthweight infants.

While attention has focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. Objective: To explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. Methods: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an Ada assessment in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted between two periods: before and after the implementation of Phase One COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared test and reported as Log2 Fold Changes (Log2 FC). Results: Between 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Between 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the UK reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; UK 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority (Germany 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; UK 50,900/68,800, 73.91%) were aged between 10 and 29 years, and about a quarter (Germany 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; UK 14,900/68,800, 21.65%) were between 30-59 years. 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were found in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (Log2 FC, P-value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. Fourteen of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. Conclusions: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","output":"Syndromic surveillance insights from a symptom assessment app before and during COVID-19 measures in Germany and the United Kingdom: results from repeated cross-sectional analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevalensi angka kejadian COVID-19 di menurut WHO per tanggal 01 september 2020 sebanyak 25.118.689 terinfeksi COVID-19 dengan kasus kematian sebanyak 844.312 dengan persentase 34%.

A 58-year-old woman underwent surgery for scoliosis and underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation. In the first postoperative (PO)day, she developed mild dyspnea. An anteroposterior chest radiograph revealed bilateral pleural effusion, which was more pronounced on the left side. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, performed in the second PO day, revealed a solid mass in the pleural cavity that was associated with screw displacement, which had also entered into the peritoneal cavity without apparent other lesion of hollow and solid viscous. In the third PO day, after the screw was removed, explorative laparoscopy was carried out. We observed herniation of the omentum through a small diaphragmatic tear. Once the absence of visceral injury was confirmed, we reduced the omentum into the abdomen. Then, we repaired the hernia by applying a dual layer polypropylene mesh over the defect with a 3-cm overlap. The remainder of the postoperative period was uneventful. Iatrogenic DH due to a pedicle screw displacement has never been described before. In cases of pleural effusion following spinal surgery, rapid assessment and treatment are crucial.

Docking-based virtual screening using the Asinex anti-viral library identified binding of drug molecules at three specific positions: loop 1 region, loop 2 region and -sheet core pockets, the loop 2 region being the most common binding and stable site for the bulk of the molecules. In parallel, the protein was characterized by vaccine design perspective and harboured three potential B cell-derived T cell epitopes: PINTNSSPD, GVPINTNSS, and DHIGTRNPA. The epitopes are highly antigenic, virulent, non-allergic, non-toxic, bind with good affinity to the highly prevalent DRB*0101 allele and show an average population coverage of 95.04%.

We compared CareStart to a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) reference, both using anterior nasal swab samples. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and the expected positive and negative predictive values at different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates. Results. We performed 666 total tests on 591 unique individuals. 573 (86%) were asymptomatic. There were 52 positive tests by RT-qPCR. The sensitivity of CareStart was 49.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 34.8 - 63.4) and specificity was 99.5% (95% CI: 98.5 - 99.9).

A cluster analysis was conducted in which two clusters emerged based solely on their valence. The variables that contributed most to the cluster were: feedback from the job, social support, problem-solving, and decision and execution autonomy. Cluster 1 aggregated higher scores on work characteristics, and Cluster 2, lower scores. Cluster 1 presented significantly higher scores on wellbeing. In Step 2, 27 of these workers were blindly interviewed. Five classes of words emerged from the interviews: Class 1 C wellbeing, Class 2 C work dissatisfaction lexicon, Class 3 C role clarity, Class 4 C job demands, and Class 5 C job resources, including receiving feedback, conversations, praise, and support. Chi-square analysis suggests significant differences in classes 2, 3, 4, and 5. Cluster 1 appears more frequently in the role clarity class and less frequently in the work dissatisfaction and job demands classes. Cluster 2 is more frequent in the job dissatisfaction and job demands classes, however, less frequent in the job resources class. Class 1 shows no significant difference. These results partially support the general hypothesis that different work characteristics will be organized into different clusters and related to the teleworkers wellbeing, but in the sense that it prevents suffering but does not necessarily promote wellbeing. The results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between work characteristics and wellbeing during the pandemic by using a different methodological approach, describing that work feedback, social support, skill variety, and problem-solving are the most significant in differentiating the perception of the groups. Social support and feedback from the job differentiate cluster 1 from cluster 2, but social support is not able to increase wellbeing, unless buffering unwellness.","output":"Wellbeing and Work Design in Brazilian Teleworkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the third cycle, China's export-oriented strategy reached its climax after the country's entry into the WTO, but its future viability was severely tested by the Global Financial Crisis.

Consumer preferences in terms of personalization and customization, sustainability criteria and the availability of digital technology together create a new paradigm for integrated product and process development. This paper unfolds from this macro perspective and makes a trajectory towards how this view influence existing and emerging metal forming processes. Knowing that design spaces in many applications are compressed, we hypothesize that characteristics such as die cost, formability, dimensional accuracy, production volume, cycle time, change-over-time, and value stream synergies become ever more important in the future. This paper outlines opportunities and limitations of several alternative forming processes due to these characteristics, and provides advice on how to select an appropriate process in relation to problem at hand, and shortfalls on industrial maturity and applicability of the following processes, viz., single point incremental forming, hydroforming, stretch-bending, and press form hardening.","output":"An overview and evaluation of alternative forming processes for complex aluminium products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, the receptor used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) to infect cells, is found not only on respiratory epithelium but also in the small bowel, large bowel, and pancreas.

The Royal Devon and Exeter provides regional vascular surgery services. A consultant-led urgent 'hot clinic' was established, providing patients with ambulatory care. We aim to describe the service for critical limb ischaemia (CLI) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate this against recommended best practice. METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic databases and records of patients with CLI during a non-COVID vs COVID-19 period. Primary outcome measures were those established by guidance from the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland. RESULTS: Non-COVID vs COVID-19: total patients n=97 vs 96, of which CLI patients n=29 vs 21. Median length of stay 15 vs 0 days (p<0.001); median time from referral to specialist review 0 vs 3 days (p<0.001); multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) recorded 3% vs 29%; median time to intervention 6 vs 8 days; conservative management 52% vs 67%; endovascular 28% vs 10%; open surgery 21% vs 24%; 30-day survival 79% vs 76%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 imposed a major change to the service for patients with CLI with a focus on ambulatory care pathways for diagnosis and intervention. We observe a significant reduction in overall length of stay with no clinically significant change in time to consultant review, time to imaging, overall management strategy or outcomes. The results of this study show that patients with CLI can be managed safely and effectively on an ambulatory basis in accordance with established best practice.","output":"Critical limb ischaemia in the time of COVID-19: establishing ambulatory service provision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has forced most educational institutions around the world to migrate to online learning in an emergency mode to protect students from the pandemic. This sudden migration to online learning has created multi-dimensional demands on students. Therefore, student workload needs to be measured during online learning. The purpose of this study is to measure the student workload from student perception by evaluating online learning in terms of Mental demand (MD), Physical demand (PD), Temporal demand (TD), Effort (EF), Performance (PE) and Frustration (FR). This study through a cross-sectional survey analysed 223 student's workloads on six dimensions using a NASA -TLX scale. The study finds all six components of workload significant for student assessment during online learning. Besides, the NASA-TLX scale was tested using confirmatory factor analysis for its ability to assess student workload for online learning. This is the first study to assess the student workload for online learning and hence contributes to the theory of measurement of workload assessment for online learning. The educational institutions can use this study to measure the student workload assessment for various courses offered by them using this simple tool.","output":"Student workload assessment for online learning: An empirical analysis during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The B.1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows enhanced infectiousness over the wild type virus, leading to increasing patient numbers in affected areas. Amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant of B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the trimer (A570D and D614G) as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region (N501Y), which comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBDCACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2. Our results demonstrate how mutations found within B.1.1.7 enlarge the flexibility around the fusion peptide and change the RBDCACE2 interface. We anticipate our findings to be starting points for in depth biochemical and cell biological analyses of B.1.1.7.","output":"Mutations in the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Reduce Receptor-Binding Affinity and Induce a Flexible Link to the Fusion Peptide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence has accumulated that the pathology of CoViD-19 is strongly related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The blockage of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to downstream consequences such as increased vascular tone, extensive fibrosis and pronounced immune reactions. Different approaches to tackle the adverse viral effects by compensating the lost ACE2 function have been suggested. Here, we use an unequal-arm lever model to describe a simplified version of the biased regulation exercised by the angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) hormones, which are the substrate and the product of ACE2, respectively. We reason upon the lever dynamics and its disruptions caused by the virus, and propose that a combination of RAS modulators will most efficiently compensate the imbalance due to the excess of angiotensin II and the scarcity of angiotensin-(1-7). Specifically, we focus on the possible benefits of the simultaneous application of two agents, a MAS-receptor agonist and an angiotensin-II-type-2-receptor agonist. We conjecture that this combination has the potential to introduce a beneficial synergistic action that promotes anti-hypoxic, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative effects, thereby improving the clinical management of acute and chronic CoViD-19 pathologies.","output":"Strengthening CoViD-19 therapy via combinations of RAS modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of neurology has experienced a dramatic push towards providing care via telemedicine approaches, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote monitoring of movement disorders, including tremor, provides a set of challenges compared to gold-standard in-clinic assessments, but also opens opportunities to assess patients' symptoms in a setting where it most matters, such as patients' homes, and during their daily life activities. A successful remote interaction with patients experiencing tremor is dependent on a seamless teleneurology interaction allowing for a high-quality medical history and physical examination. In addition to the clinical evaluation, tremor may be characterized and quantified remotely using transducer-based methods, which may be applying devices containing sensors to objectively and precisely capture tremor movements. This review aims to provide (Zheng et al., 2017 [1]) a practice-oriented overview of telemedicine basics, when it comes to the assessment of tremor, Powers et al. (2021) [2] an update of the most notable techniques and devices, and (Mari, 2021 [3]) an outlook into future opportunities and challenges, as well as and next steps towards seamless remote care of patient with tremor. In conclusion, teleneurology, propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, has evolved into to a widely established method of physician-patient interaction, aided by technological advancement of remote assessment tools of tremor. However, as the technological, regulatory and reimbursement environment is increasingly adapting to serve the needs of telemedicine, the methods presented for remote measurement of tremor using devices are still largely experimental and largely limited to the research setting.

Participants were randomized 1:1 to BCG vs saline and followed for 6 months. From December 2020, Covid-19 vaccines were offered to the HCW. In most cases, BCG vaccination results in a characteristic scar. Reactivation of the BCG scar has been described in children during viral infections and following influenza vaccination, but is mostly associated to Kawasakis disease, a disease entity with pathogenesis likely similar to the child Covid-19 complication MIS-C: Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. Reactivation of scars after neonatal BCG vaccination has recently been described in four women after Covid-19 mRNA vaccination. Two of our trial participants experienced reactivation of their novel BCG scars after receiving mRNA Covid-19 vaccination 6 to 8 months post-BCG. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two female HCW participants that had been randomly allocated to BCG in the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial, spontaneously reported itching and secretion at the BCG scar site after having received mRNA Covid-19 vaccination (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) 6 to 8 months following inclusion and BCG vaccination. One participant, who had a larger BCG skin reaction, noticed re-appearing symptoms after both the first and the second COVID-vaccine dose, while the other participant only noted symptoms after the second dose. Both had been BCG vaccinated during childhood, and no reactivation was noted in the older scars. No treatment was needed or provided. CONCLUSIONS: The reactivation of the BCG scar after receiving mRNA vaccine might have been caused by cross-reactivity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2. In both cases, the symptoms were bothersome, but self-limiting and left no sequelae. The risk of reactivation at the scar site is thus not a reason to avoid vaccination with either vaccine.","output":"Reactivation of BCG vaccination scars after vaccination with mRNA-Covid-vaccines: two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e., the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.","output":"A Transformer-based Math Language Model for Handwritten Math Expression Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the influence of mobility on the stock market reaction around earnings announcements during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.","output":"Clinical characteristics of the recovered COVID-19 patients with re-detectable positive RNA test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for more than a year and a half, and the number of confirmed cases of infection in the world has already exceeded 150 million people.

Few studies have explored their combined mental health effects on young people. While self-focused rumination has been suggested to be a key mechanism underlying depression, the role of event-based rumination in mediating the impact of population stressors has yet to be elucidated. METHODS Data were collected from 6988 young people in a large-scale community online survey in Hong Kong. The survey assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, direct exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related events, personal stressful life events, event-based rumination and other individual risk factors. RESULTS High levels of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms were observed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that probable post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with traumatic events (odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = [1.64, 1.82]), pandemic-related events (odds ratio = 1.08, confidence interval = [1.01, 1.16]), stressful life events (odds ratio = 1.20, confidence interval = [1.21, 1.37]), high event-based rumination (odds ratio = 3.00, confidence interval = [2.58, 3.48]), lower resilience (odds ratio = 1.18, confidence interval = [1.15, 1.21]), higher smartphone reliance (odds ratio = 1.09, confidence interval = [1.05, 1.13]) and financial concerns (odds ratio = 1.25, confidence interval = [1.18, 1.33]). The odds for probable post-traumatic stress disorder was also significantly higher when two or more traumatic events were experienced (odds ratio = 4.03, confidence interval = [3.52, 4.62]). Factors associated with moderate-to-severe level depressive symptoms were similar. Event-based rumination significantly mediated between different types of external events (traumatic events, pandemic-related events, stressful life events) and both post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that diverse types of stressful events during population-level crises could add to personal stressors to affect mental health outcomes in young people. Among other protective and risk factors, event-based rumination presented as a prominent transdiagnostic mediator for different symptom dimensions which may be a potentially important target for early risk detection and intervention.","output":"The impact of social unrest and pandemic on mental health of young people in Hong Kong: The transdiagnostic role of event-based rumination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Migrant workers seeking employment in a host country often face a variety of stressors that affect their mental health.

This paper mainly studies the mechanism of dopaminergic neurotransmission in different doses of morphine addiction and stress-induced depression. In the experiment, 40 male SD rats were selected. The experiment established a rat model of chronic stress depression. The rats used in this model are all raised in a single cage, and there will be various stimuli every day for 21 days, but high-intensity continuous stimuli must be avoided, and the same stimuli will not appear continuously. The experiment established a depression animal model through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), combined with the conditioned position preference (CPP) model of morphine addiction to detect the establishment of CPP in such animals, so as to explore certain stress stimuli or depression, the influence on morphine addiction, and the relationship between them. The second or third branches of pyramidal neurons were selected to analyze the PL and CA3 regions. When analyzing the density of dendrites, each animal selected at least 8 dendrites in order to count the number of dendrites and selected a length of 20 m on each branch to record the number of dendrites. All measured values are expressed as average  standard deviation and analyzed by SPSS17.0 statistical software, and Levene test is used in the scattered consistency test. The average NIV of PEN before injection was 11.92  2.90 Hz, and the average latency was 0.16  0.03 s.

At the same time, there are few publications in the medical literature on rehabilitation programs for patients after total knee arthroplasty. Available scientific studies have proven the effectiveness of low-intensity laser therapy and a pulsed low-frequency electrostatic field (PLFEF) in tissue repair by modulating the inflammatory process and relieving pain. OBJECTIVE: Scientific substantiation of the feasibility of the combined use of low-intensity laser radiation (LILR) and PLFEF in patients after total knee arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 90 patients aged from 55 to 80 years after total knee arthroplasty were examined. All patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Patients of the 1st group underwent therapeutic exercises with an instructor and low-intensity laser exposure; in the 2nd group, therapeutic exercises with an instructor, low-intensity laser therapy, and PLFEF were performed without a time interval; patients of the 3rd group received only therapeutic exercises with an instructor. RESULTS: After the course of treatment, a positive dynamics of the state of microcirculation was noted in all patients, which correlated with a significant regression of the pain syndrome and an improvement in the performance of the 10-meter walk test with external support on crutches. However, a more significant decrease in pain intensity after the first procedures and at the end of the course of treatment was found in the group of patients who received complex therapy, which included LILR, PLFEF, and therapeutic exercises.

The outbreak emerged from Wuhan, China, and later spread throughout the world. Until the first week of May 2020, over 3.7 million cases had been reported worldwide and more than 258,000 had died due to the disease. So far, off label use of various drugs has been tried in many clinical settings, however, at present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronaviruses. Therefore, repurposing of the available drugs may be promising to control emerging infections of SARS-COV2; however, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Glycopeptides, which are active against gram-positive bacteria, have demonstrated significant activity against viral infections including SARS-COV and MERS-COV and have a high resemblance of sequence homology with SARS-COV2. Recent in vitro studies have also shown promising activities of aglycon derivative of glycopeptides and teicoplanin against SARS-COV2. Hydrophobic aglycon derivatives and teicoplanin, with minimal toxicity to human cell lines, inhibit entry and replication of SARS-COV2. These drugs block proteolysis of polyprotein a/b with replicase and transcription domains. Teicoplanin use was associated with complete viral clearance in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms. This review attempts to describe the activity, elucidate the possible mechanisms and potential clinical applications of existing glycopeptides against corona viruses, specifically SARS-COV2.","output":"Glycopeptides as Potential Interventions for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) is a pore-forming molecule that serves as the final effector of pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death) following activation of the cellular inflammasome in monocytes. Disulfiram (DSM), a drug used in the treatment of alcohol abuse, has recently been shown to inhibit GSDMD via disruption of pore formation after its cleavage by the inflammatory caspases (1, 4, and 5). The aim of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory effects of DSM on GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and explore its role as a potential therapeutic agent in sepsis. METHODS: A series of experiments was conducted using THP1 cells (a human monocytic cell line) or purified human monocytes from the blood of healthy donors. Samples were pretreated with DSM in various concentrations 30 minutes prior to inflammasome activation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cells were then assessed under light microscopy for swelling and fluorescent microscopy for the formation of ASC specks (activated oligomers of the adaptor protein required for caspase activation). Cell death was assessed using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay. Interleukin-1-beta (IL1?) release was measured by ELISA. GSDMD cleavage, pro-IL1? synthesis, and caspase-1 cleavage were assessed using immunoblots. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, low dose DSM accentuated inflammasome activation. Dramatic inflammasome induction was observed at a concentration of 10uM, a dose associated with near peak inhibition in the prior study. However, higher doses of 50 to 100 uM suppressed pyroptosis as evidenced by loss of cell swelling and ASC speck formation, as well as LDH and IL-1? release. The DSM effect occurred downstream of caspase-1 activation as evidenced by preserved intracellular pro-IL1? synthesis and caspase-1 cleavage in the presence of DSM. Contrary to the prior report, GSDMD cleavage appeared to be inhibited at these higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: DSM unexpectedly exhibits upstream activation of the inflammasome at low doses but downstream inhibition at high doses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although DSM's inhibitory effects on inflammasome function make it a promising agent for the future treatment of acute inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and covid-19, our results indicate that further study is needed to better characterize its possible activating effects at lower concentrations.

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. METHODS: We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 serum) and in France (20,652 serum) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 serum, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. RESULTS: The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2C95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7C96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957C0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02C31.0; P = 0.04).

First, an extensive experimental database for lightweight concrete slabs tested under punching shear loading is gathered. Then, effective parameters are determined by applying the principles of statistical methods, namely, concrete density, columns dimensions, slab effective depth, concrete strength, flexure reinforcement ratio, and steel yield stress. Next, the manuscript presented three artificial intelligence models, which are genetic programming (GP), artificial neural network (ANN) and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR). In addition, it provided guidance for future design code development, where the importance of each variable on the strength was identified. Moreover, it provided an expression showing the complicated inter-relation between affective variables.

Risk factors associated with this disease are age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and the mortality rate of COVID-19. We selected studies based upon epidemiological and clinical descriptions of the patients and mortality from the disease to determine the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in all patients and in mortality cases due to COVID-19. The pooled prevalence was estimated using the random effects model, and odds ratios were used to measure the probability of death for a patient with a comorbidity. The total prevalence of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 was 42% (95% CI: 25-60), 61% (95% CI: 42-80) in those admitted to the ICU, and 77% (95% CI: 68-86) among death cases; males were the most affected. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in all three groups studied, accounting for 32%, 26%, and 35%, respectively. The odds ratio of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to one with no comorbidity was 2.4 (P < 0.0001).

Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) is likewise another streamlining method for comprehending the non-direct complex optimization problem. Consequently, in the current paper, an endeavor has been made toward the expulsion of the downsides from the traditional SOS by proposing a novel ensemble technique called e-SOSBSA to overhaul the degree of intensification and diversification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). Molecular prevalence of NDV, IBV, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2, MG, and MS was carried out on swab, and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of NDV, IBV, Influenza type A virus, MG, and MS in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4%, 50.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 3.6%, respectively. Specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks, indicating concurrent viral infections. The molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2) while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected. The molecular prevalence rate of NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2 was 46.97%, 56.1%, and 19.7% in backyard flocks, respectively. Combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks, respectively. Mixed infection of IBV, LPAIV H9N2, and/or Escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks, inducing severe clinical outcomes. Avian pathogenic E. coli was, respectively, isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality. Mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flock. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection.

In this blinded randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2021-002348-57) we compare the efficacy and safety of an additional booster vaccination with a vector versus mRNA vaccine in non-seroconverted patients. We assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment, who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Patients were stratified according to the presence of peripheral B-cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between vector (heterologous) and mRNA (homologous) vaccinated patients by week four. Key secondary endpoints included the overall seroconversion and cellular immune response; safety was assessed at weeks one and four. Seroconversion rates at week four were comparable between vector (6/27 patients, 22%) and mRNA (9/28, 32%) vaccine (p=0.6). Overall, 27% of patients seroconverted; specific T-cell responses were observed in 20/20 (100%) vector versus 13/16 (81%) mRNA vaccinated patients. Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. No serious adverse events, related to immunization, were observed.

The COVID-19 pandemic requires a global response for this most vulnerable population. This study purpose was to explore whether fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence are related to the likelihood of remaining at work following treatment in male cancer survivors. Survivors and methods: A cross-sectional survey was used. Data were collected in China in May to June 2020. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) Inventory-Short Form and work sustainability subscale of the Readiness for Return to Work Scale were completed by male cancer survivors. Results: A total of 121 employed male cancer survivors participated in this study. Fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence were both negatively correlated with work sustainability ( = ?0.11, and  = ?0.19, respectively). Significant interaction effects between fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence were observed ( = 0.46, P &lt;0.01). Advanced disease stage, undergoing radiation therapy and having recently completed cancer treatment were all factors related to lower work sustainability scores ( = ?0.28,  = ?0.15, and  = ?0.17, respectively). The overall path model yielded a good fit: 2/df = 1.12 (P = 0.24), RMSEA = 0.07, TLI = 0.98, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.92, and NFI = 0.96. Conclusion: Fear of COVID-19 is a mediator between fear of cancer recurrence and work sustainability among Chinese male cancer survivors. The findings also indicated that male cancer survivors with higher FCR levels reported less confidence in their ability to remain at work. This information can assist in the development of new interventions and educational programs for cancer survivors, healthcare providers and employers, to improve employees ability to remain at work. ? 2021.

This study aimed to evaluate the risk and correlative factors of seizures in patients with epilepsy (PWE) after being vaccinated with COVID-19 and to provide reference opinions for PWE to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: : We retrospectively enrolled PWE patients who were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the epilepsy centers of nine hospitals in China. The binary logistic regression analysis included variables with a P-value less than 0.1 in the univariate analysis. Results: : The study included 290 patients, of which 40 (13.8%) developed seizures within 14 days after vaccination, whereas 250 (86.2%) remained seizure-free. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed statistical significance in seizures within three months before vaccination (P<0.001, OR=10.121, 95% CI: 4.301-23.816) and withdrawal or reduction of anti-seizures medications (ASM) during the peri-vaccination period (P=0.027, OR=4.452, 95% CI: 1.182-16.768). In addition, 32 of 33 patients (97.0%) who were seizure-free within three months before vaccination and had normal EEG results before vaccination did not have any seizures within 14 days following vaccination. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 may induce epilepsy through an inflammatory cascade. It is recommended to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to seizure-free patients for at least three months before vaccination, and the vaccination is safer if EEG result is normal. During peri-vaccination period, all PWE should be prohibited from reducing ASM dosage. PWE with well-controlled seizures who have discontinued ASM might consider resuming ASM during the peri-vaccination period if their EEG results are aberrant.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Seizures in Patients With Epilepsy: a Multicenter, Retrospective Study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes four structural proteins that include the spike glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-protein) The N-protein interacts with viral genomic RNA and helps in packaging As SARS-CoV-2 spread to almost all countries worldwide within 2C3 months, it also acquired mutations in its RNA genome Therefore, this study was conducted with an aim to identify the variations present in N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 Here, we analysed 4,163 reported sequence of N-protein from United States of America (USA) and compared them with the first reported sequence from Wuhan, China Our study identified 107 mutations that reside all over the N-protein Further, we show the high rate of mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of N-protein Our study show 45% residues of IDR2 harbour mutations The RNA-binding domain (RBD) and dimerization domain of N-protein also have mutations at key residues We further measured the effect of these mutations on N-protein stability and dynamicity and our data reveals that multiple mutations can cause considerable alterations Altogether, our data strongly suggests that N-protein is one of the mutational hotspot proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that is changing rapidly and these mutations can potentially interferes with various aspects of N-protein functions including its interaction with RNA, oligomerization and signalling events","output":"Identification and molecular characterization of mutations in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

This behavioral study was conducted to determine whether changing the uterine or rearing environment (as is integral to common rederivation methods) would have a significant effect on the expression of the behavioral traits in question. Selected breeding pairs of the affected lines were divided into four treatment groups: 1) transfer of embryos to pseudopregnant B6D2F1 female mice, 2) fostering offspring to B6D2F1 dams, 3) fostering offspring to a different dam of the same line, and 4) offspring raised by the birth dam. Embryo transfers were successful only in one affected line. At approximately 50 days of age, the offspring were tested for locomotor behavior after intraperitoneal administration of ethanol or normal saline. There were no statistically significant effects of embryo transfer on the ethanol phenotype (ethanol-induced locomotor depression). Fostering significantly reduced the stimulant response to ethanol of only one mouse line selectively bred for high sensitivity to ethanol-induced stimulation, although the stimulant response of the fostered groups was still quite robust. Overall, the results of this study showed that eradication efforts involving fostering of offspring have a modest impact on the stimulant response to ethanol, but there were insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the use of embryo transfer.","output":"The effect of fostering on the genetic expression of locomotor sensitivity to alcohol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 2010s, fertility rates fell across the Nordic region. The onset of these declines seems linked to the Great Recession of 2008C2009, but their continuation cannot easily be linked to subsequent economic change. The 1990s, too, brought episodes of economic crises to the Nordic region that were followed by different degrees of fertility decline. In this study, we provide an empirical overview of parity-, age- and education-specific fertility developments in the five Nordic countries in the wake of the economic recessions in 2008 and the early 1990s, respectively. We demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in fertility developments across countries after 1990, whereas after 2008, the trends are much more similar across the five countries. Likewise, the educational differences in birth hazards that characterized the developments after 1990 were much smaller in the initial years after 2008C2009. This reversal from heterogeneity to homogeneity in the fertility response to recessions calls for an expansion of theories on the cyclicality of fertility in relation to uncertainty and economic and social change.

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log(10) plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log(10) PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single three-minute microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination.

However, the surgeon's physical load is higher due to longer duration static and awkward body postures, increasing the risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Interventions of an organisational nature are work breaks, being either passive or active. The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether passive and active work breaks lead to less discomfort than no work breaks and whether active work breaks lead to less discomfort than passive work breaks. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A controlled, randomised cross-over trial will be performed in the laboratory, of which its protocol is described here according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Statement. Recruitment of 21 laparoscopic surgeons started in April 2019 and the study is ongoing. The participating surgeons will perform three 1.5 hour experimental conditions, one without work breaks, one with 2.5 min passive work breaks including rest, and one with 2.5 min active work breaks including mobility and stretching exercises. The work breaks will be taken after 30 and 60 min of work. During the experiments, outcomes will be recorded. The primary outcome is rating of perceived discomfort measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale. The secondary outcomes are performance, muscle activity of selected muscles, upper body angles, heart rate, workload and subjective evaluation of both interventions.

In response to the GFC, the Federal Reserve first lowered the overnight federal funds rate from 5.25% in August 2007 to zero in December 2008. It then turned to quantitative easing, purchasing housing agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. While these policies helped the overall economy to recover, they may have harmed the banking sector. Banks accept safe short-term deposits and transform these into risky longer-term loans. They make a profit on the difference between the interest rate they earn on longer-term assets and the rate they pay of short-term deposits (the net interest margin). Low short-term interest rates and compressed spreads between long- and short-term interest rates may impair bank profitability. Bernanke and Gertler (J Econ Perspect 4:27C48, 1995) showed that reduced bank profitability can hinder their ability to extend loans. Bernanke (FRBNY Q Rev 18:50C70, 1993) noted that this is problematic because banks play a special role in channeling savings to promising borrowers. Financial markets are plagued by information imperfections. Savers release funds today for the promise of obtaining funds later. Whether they get repaid depends on the character of the borrower, the quality of the investment, the collateral that the borrower can provide, and other factors. The lender needs to consider these items and not just interest rates. Asymmetric information can thus hinder the flow of funds from savers to small businesses and other borrowers whose quality is hard to evaluate. Banks can bridge imperfect information problems because they have a comparative advantage because of the following reasons: (1) economies of specialization, as lending officers gain expertise in a particular industry; (2) economies of scale, as it is cheaper for bank to evaluate a loan than for small savers to; and (3) economies of scope, as it is cheaper to provide lending services together with other services. This paper investigates how lower short-term rates and falls in the spread between long-and short-term rates affect bank profitability. To do this, it investigates how these variables affect bank stock prices. Stock prices provide valuable information since they are the expected present value of future cash flows. The results indicate that falls in short rates and in the spread have caused large drops in bank stock returns after the GFC. Banks are also facing competitive pressures from Fin Tech firms and big technology firms. Their performance after the GFC has lagged other parts of the U.S. economy. They are thus vulnerable to negative shocks that could arise during a downturn or a crisis. The Fed should take account of the impact of their policies on the banking sector, since an interruption on the flow of credit through the financial system could prevent funds from going to the most promising firms. This misallocation of resources could then hinder long-term economic growth.","output":"Non-traditional monetary policy and the future of the financial industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing incidence and prevalence, Crohns disease (CD) has become one of the most challenging diseases in both diagnosis and treatment of gastroenterology.

In this study, we developed a method to search the basal SARS-CoV-2 clade among collected SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We first identified the mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence alignment. Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission.

In this work, we introduce a new system called Crystalline that attempts to automatically collect and organize information into tabular structures as the user searches and browses the web. It leverages natural language processing to automatically group similar criteria together to reduce clutter as well as passive behavioral signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to infer what information to collect and how to visualize and prioritize it.

This was shown by the increase in global online searches related to health during the pandemic. In this study, we described the dynamics of public interest and awareness in diabetes before and during the pandemic and determined the possible factors associated with online interest in diabetes. Methods Global online search interest for diabetes was measured using Google Trends? database. We used the search terms diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. We limited the results from 2010 until 2020 from all countries. Correlation between country-specific characteristics and search volume index was determined using Spearman's rank-order correlation. Results This study showed a steady increase in global online interest in diabetes during the last decade. SVI for all the diabetes search terms included in this study increased from 2019 to 2020. People searching for the term diabetes also searched for the different types of diabetes, causes, signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, and treatments for diabetes. The increasing online interest in diabetes was positively correlated with percentage of individuals using the internet and the number of physicians in a country. Conclusions The results of this study showed an increasing global online interest in diabetes during the last decade. This increased global interest in diabetes should be maximized by medical doctors and public health officials in providing evidence-based information regarding prevention and control of diabetes in the internet.","output":"Increased global online interest in diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: An infodemiology study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is a rapid non-invasive ophthalmic imaging technique that identifies corneal nerve fibre damage. Small studies suggest that CCM could be used to assess patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). AIM: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic utility of CCM for sub-clinical DPN (DPN- ) and established DPN (DPN+ ). DATA SOURCES: Databases (PubMed, Embase, Central, ProQuest) were searched for studies using CCM in patients with diabetes up to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they reported on at least one CCM parameter in patients with diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION: Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and inferior whorl length (IWL) were compared between patients with diabetes with and without DPN and controls. Meta-analysis was undertaken using RevMan V.5.3. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-eight studies including ~4000 participants were included in this meta-analysis. There were significant reductions in CNFD, CNBD, CNFL and IWL in DPN- vs. controls (P<0.00001), DPN+ vs. controls (P<0.00001) and DPN+ vs. DPN- (P<0.00001).

Primary efficacy outcome was in-hospital incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE): asymptomatic or symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed by serial compression ultrasonography (CUS), and/or symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Secondary endpoints included each individual component of the primary efficacy outcome and a composite of death, VTE, mechanical ventilation, stroke, myocardial infarction, admission to ICU. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. RESULTS: The study was interrupted prematurely due to slow recruitment. We included 183 (96%) of the 189 enrolled patients in the primary analysis (91 in b.i.d., 92 in o.d.). Primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6 patients (6.5%, 0 DVT, 6 PE) in the o.d. group and 0 in the b.id. group (ARR 6.5, 95% CI: 1.5-11.6). The absence of concomitant DVT and imaging characteristics suggests that most pulmonary artery occlusions were actually caused by local thrombi rather than PE. Statistically nonsignificant differences in secondary and safety endpoints were observed, with two major bleeding events in each arm. CONCLUSIONS: No DVT developed in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in general wards, independently of enoxaparin dosing used for thromboprophylaxis.

For foregrounds made of a number of unclustered point sources, an estimator for the source amplitude can be derived and deprojected, removing any bias to the lensing reconstruction. We show with simulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be approximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a simple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing, at a minimal noise cost. We compare the performance and bias to other methods such as\\"shear-only\\"reconstruction, and discuss how to jointly deproject any arbitrary number of foregrounds, each with an arbitrary profile. In particular, for a Simons Observatory-like experiment foreground-hardened estimators allow us to extend the maximum multipole used in the reconstruction, increasing the overall statistical power by $\\\\sim 50\\\\%$ over the standard quadratic estimator, both in auto and cross-correlation.

We aimed to study the utility of 2 methods of virtual learning: the daily National Surgery Resident Lecture Series (NSRLS), and weekly SCORE School educational webinars designed around the Surgical Council on Resident Education (SCORE) curriculum. DESIGN AND SETTING: NSRLS: The National Surgery Resident Lecture Series was a daily virtual educational session initially led by faculty at an individual surgical residency program. Thirty-eight lectures were assessed for number of live viewings (March 23, 2020-May 15, 2020). SCORE SCHOOL: Attendance at eleven weekly SCORE educational webinars was characterized into live and asynchronous viewings (May 13, 2020-August 5, 2020). Each 1-hour live webinar was produced by SCORE on a Wednesday evening and featured nationally recognized surgeon educators using an online platform that allowed for audience interaction. RESULTS: NSRLS: There were a mean of 71 live viewers per NSRLS session (range 19-118). Participation began to decline in the final 2 weeks as elective case volumes increased, but sessions remained well-attended. SCORE SCHOOL: There were a range of 164-3889 live viewers per SCORE School session. Sessions have most commonly been viewed asynchronously (89.8% of viewings). Live viewership decreased as the academic year ended and then rebounded with the start of the new academic year (range 4.9%-27%). Overall, the eight webinars were viewed 11,135 times. Each webinar continues to be viewed a mean of 43 times a day (range 0-102). Overall, the eleven webinars have been viewed a total of 22,722 times. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual didactics aimed at surgical residents are feasible, well-attended (both live and recorded), and have high levels of viewer engagement. We have observed that careful coordination of timing and topics is ideal. The ability for asynchronous viewing is particularly important for attendance.

This study describes and elucidates the roles of environmental factors in future PHERSs. To improve countries capability to respond to public health emergencies associated with viral infections such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of environmental factors should be considered before, during, and after the responses to such emergencies. More specifically, to prevent pandemic outbreaks, we should strengthen environmental and wildlife protection, conduct detailed viral surveillance in animals and hotspots, and improve early-warning systems. During the pandemic, we must study the impacts of environmental factors on viral behaviors, develop control measures to minimize secondary environmental risks, and conduct timely assessments of viral risks and secondary environmental effects with a view to reducing the impacts of the pandemic on human health and on ecosystems. After the pandemic, we should further strengthen surveillance for viruses and the prevention of viral spread, maintain control measures for minimizing secondary environmental risks, develop our capability to scientifically predict pandemics and resurgences, and prepare for the next unexpected resurgence.

We therefore compared the cellular and humoral immune responses of these two groups of patients. Neutralizing anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were identified as the primary correlate of protection for transplant recipients. Analysis of virus-specific B and T cell responses suggested that the generation of neutralizing anti-RBD IgG may have depended upon cognate T-B cell interactions that took place in germinal center, potentially acting as a limiting checkpoint. High dose mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive drug, was associated with fewer antigen-specific B and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells after vaccination; this was not observed in patients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we observed that, in two independent prospective cohorts, administration of a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine restored neutralizing titers of anti-RBD IgG in about 40% of individuals who had not previously responded to two doses of vaccine.

Despite numerous reports describing ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution, there remains a paucity of data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors. Here, we systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19. However, ACE2 protein was increased in children, a demographic with a reduced incidence of severe COVID-19. These results offer new insights into ACE2 localization and function in susceptibility to COVID-19.","output":"Heterogeneous expression of the SARS-Coronavirus-2 receptor ACE2 in the human respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the recent SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge (Rizzi et al. 2020 in J Comput Aided Mol Des 34:601C633) aimed at assessing convergence properties and reproducibility of molecular dynamics binding free energy methodologies, we propose a simple explanation of the severe errors observed in the nonequilibrium switch double-system-single-box (NS-DSSB) approach when using unidirectional estimates.

This paper reports the results of an extensive literature review of the age-rating systems of digital content (audiovisual and games) used around the world and demonstrates the weakness of those instruments that prove ineffective in choosing digital content for children. Age-rating systems are arbitrary and only focus on explicit content that is considered harmful to preschool children. The paper proposes an alternative model of app analysis based on child development. The main objective of the research is to determine the developmental appropriateness of apps for young children and its effects on childrens responses through a content analysis of 318 apps and a test of a subset of them (N=25) with a sample of 53 children aged 3-5. To this end, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis is used to extract a composite index of the apps developmental appropriateness, which was used to specify a path analysis.

Mistrusting the COVID-19 vaccine, distrusting the authorities, and unrealistic optimism, are three major reasons employed in justifying vaccine hesitancy. The present study examines two major issues. First, it strives to identify individuals that are unwilling to adhere to the vaccination process, more strongly question the effectiveness and necessity of the COVID-19 vaccine, and wonder about potential covert reasons for its administration. Second, it investigates associations between such conspiracy claims and the actual rejection of the vaccine. We assume that individuals belonging to social groups which are partly excluded by the general society will be less willing to fulfill the demands of this society, more inclined to reject the vaccine and associate it with some hidden conspiracy. A relatively large sample of the Israeli public (N = 2002) has responded to an anonymous questionnaire pertaining, among other things, to vaccine hesitancy and the individual level of vaccine uptake. Previous research has mainly examined the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. The present study's results indicate that three out of four social exclusion criteria (young adulthood, low level of income, and orthodox religiosity) have negatively predicted vaccine uptake and positively predicted three types of reasoning for vaccine hesitancy. Young adulthood was the strongest predictor of vaccine rejection. Attempts at convincing hesitating individuals to uptake this vaccine have often failed in many countries. As varied reasons underlie vaccine refusal, it is suggested that the approach to different vaccine rejecting groups should not be generic but rather tailor-made, in an attempt to influence their perceptions and behavior.","output":"Belonging to Socially Excluded Groups as a Predictor of Vaccine Hesitancy and Rejection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleolus and contains an eight-amino-acid nucleolar retention motif.

While telemedicine is rapidly evolving in the fields of teleconsultation and telesurgery, proper telediagnostic systems are not yet available, although the demand for contactless patient-doctor interaction is increasing. METHODS: In this project, the current limitations were addressed by developing a comprehensive telediagnostic system. Therefore, medical examinations have been assessed in collaboration with medical experts. Subsequently, a framework was developed, satisfying the relevant constraints of medical-, technical-, and hygienic- aspects in order to transform in-person examinations into a contactless procedure. Diagnostic steps were classified into three groups: assisted procedures carried out by the patient, teleoperated examination methods, and adoptions of conventional methods. RESULTS: The Telemedical Diagnostic Framework was implemented, resulting in a functional proof of concept, where potentially infectious patients could undergo a full medical examination. The system comprises, e.g., a naso-pharyngeal swab, an inspection of the oral cavity, auscultation, percussion, and palpation, based on robotic end-effectors. The physician is thereby connected using a newly developed user-interface and a lead robot, with force feedback control, that enables precise movements with the follower robot on the patient's side. CONCLUSION: Our concept proves the feasibility of a fully telediagnostic system, that consolidates available technology and new developments to an efficient solution enabling safe patient-doctor interaction.

Gene expression alterations of the ARID family are correlated with the pathogenesis of digestive cancer, but systematic research has not been conducted. Methods: We obtained transcriptome sequencing data, clinical characteristics and stemness indices of the seven main types of digestive cancer (cholangiocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma) from public pan-cancer data to combine the analysis of the expression and prognostic signature of the ARID gene family. The stromal and immune scores for each sample were calculated to explore the correlations between the ARID gene family members and the tumour microenvironment. Results: After screening, 1,920 digestive cancer samples were included in our study. ARID3C was expressed at low levels throughout the digestive cancer samples. The expression levels of ARID1A and JARID1C were relatively high, but there was striking heterogeneity across the different cancer types for specific family members. The survival analysis indicated that many genes were significantly related to the prognosis of patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma. The stemness indices, stromal score, and immune score analysis showed that the expression of a single ARID gene had characteristic consistency in each tumour, but the levels among the different genes still varied. Conclusion: Our systematic study of the ARID gene family and its association with the immune infiltrate, tumour microenvironment and outcomes of digestive cancer patients focus on the complex relations and indicate the need to study each ARID member as an individual in a specific cancer type.","output":"Expression Signature of the AT-Rich Interactive Domain Gene Family Identified in Digestive Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Maintenance of central blood volume (CBV) is essential for hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis (HD), though preservation of CBV is poorly understood. Pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) during HD may help maintain CBV. METHODS We performed a randomized, crossover trial to determine the effect of PCDs on CBV during HD. Patients underwent two consecutive mid-week HD sessions, randomized to begin the first session either with or without PCDs [stratified by intradialytic hypotension (IDH)-prone status]. The primary outcome was change in CBV during HD. The secondary outcomes were change in other hemodynamic and volume status parameters. RESULTS Fifty-one patients (median age 65 years, 75% male, 22% IDH-prone) were randomized; forty-six completed the study. During HD, the median change in CBV for PCD and control sessions was -0.08 versus -0.05 L (P = 0.62). There was no difference in the change in cardiac output (CO) (-0.63 versus -0.49 L/min, P = 0.78) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (+1.30 versus +1.55 mmHg/L/min, P = 0.67) for PCDs versus control. Based on the bioimpedance measurements, patients were not volume overloaded pre-dialysis. There was a greater reduction in total body water (TBW) (-2.6 versus -2.3 L, P = 0.05) and intracellular fluid (ICF) volume (-1.3 versus -1.1 L, P = 0.03), and no difference in change in the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (1.3 versus 1.2 L, P = 0.09) with PCDs versus control. Similar results were observed in IDH-prone patients. CONCLUSIONS Compared with standard of care, PCDs have no effect on intradialytic hemodynamic parameters, including CBV, although they may allow greater capacity for fluid removal.

The aim of the present study is to review the existence of medicinally important secondary metabolites and possible pharmacological and pharmacognostic importance of under-explored weed plant species Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit., to explore the potentiality of the plant for developing and designing the drugs for future. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Hyptis suaveolens belonging to family Lamiaceae is the rich source of medicinally important phytochemicals like essential oils, tannins, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and sterols. One or many of these compounds have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-septic, anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, diaphoretics, anticutaneous, anticatarrhal, antirheumatic, anti-ulcer, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, analgesic, and antiviral activity. SHORT CONCLUSION: Hyptis suaveolens contains unique terpenoid metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate that have potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid have been reported to have effective antiviral response against the SARS-CoV2 responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which no effective vaccines are available till date. Ursolic acid has the ability to modulate the activity of main protease (M(pro)) that is essential for processing of SARS-CoV2 replicase-transcriptase machinery needed for viral replication and particle assembly.","output":"A review on the phytochemical and pharmacological properties of Hyptis suaveolens (L.)

The privileged tropism of LASV for endothelial cells combined with a dysregulated inflammatory response are the main cause of the increase in vascular permeability observed during the disease. Mopeia virus (MOPV) is another arenavirus closely related to LASV but nonpathogenic for non-human primates (NHPs) and has never been described in humans. MOPV is more immunogenic than LASV in NHPs and in vitro in human immune cell models, with more intense type I IFN and adaptive cellular responses. Here, we compared the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to infection with the two viruses to further decipher the mechanisms involved in their differences in immunogenicity and pathogenicity. Both viruses replicated durably and efficiently in HUVECs, but the responses they induced were strikingly different. Modest activation was observed at an early stage of LASV infection and then rapidly shut down. By contrast, MOPV induced a late but more intense response, characterized by the expression of genes and proteins mainly associated with the type I IFN response and antigen processing/presentation. Such a response is consistent with the higher immunogenicity of MOPV relative to LASV, whereas the lack of an innate response induced in HUVECs by LASV is consistent with its uncontrolled systemic dissemination through the vascular endothelium.","output":"Infection of Human Endothelial Cells with Lassa Virus Induces Early but Transient Activation and Low Type I IFN Response Compared to the Closely-Related Nonpathogenic Mopeia Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of the study was to describe the use of masks among health care personnel (HCP) exposed to index cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to evaluate any association with infection rate. METHODS We did a retrospective, observational study of HCP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for the management of COVID-19 (before person-to-person transmission was official confirmed, no additional protection was provided). A questionnaire was given to all staff listed on the roster in the clinical regions providing care for index patients with COVID-19. All participants were surveyed regarding hand-washing and use of surgical masks and gloves and were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data were analysed (Student's t test and Pearson 2 test) for an association between infection and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS Exposure of a total of 299 non-infected and 30 infected staff was confirmed. None of the 149 staff who reported use of all three preventative measures (hand-washing and use of gloves and masks) became infect-ed. In contrast, all 30 of the staff who became infected had omitted at least one of the measures. Fewer staff who wore surgical masks (P=0.000003) became infected compared with those who did not. Infections rates were significantly lower in HCP from the internal medicine departments, as these personnel generally wore masks. CONCLUSION An association was found between SARS-CoV-2 infection of HCP and the non-use of masks when working with index cases in clinical settings.

A moratorium on elective surgery was placed early in the pandemic to reduce risk to patients and staff and preserve critical care resources. This report evaluates the impact of the elective surgical moratorium on case volumes and intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. METHODS: This retrospective review used a national convenience sample to correlate trends in the weekly rates of surgical cases at 170 Veterans Affairs Hospitals around the United States from January 1 to September 30, 2020 to national trends in the COVID-19 pandemic. We reviewed data on weekly number of procedures performed and ICU bed usage, stratified by level of urgency (elective, urgent, emergency), and whether an ICU bed was required within 24 hours of surgery. National data on the proportion of COVID-19 positive test results and mortality rates were obtained from the Center for Disease Control website. RESULTS: 198,911 unique surgical procedures performed during the study period. The total number of cases performed from January 1 to March 16 was 86,004 compared with 15,699 from March 17 to May 17. The reduction in volume occurred before an increase in the percentage of COVID-19 positive test results and deaths nationally. There was a 91% reduction from baseline in the number of elective surgeries performed allowing 78% of surgical ICU beds to be available for COVID-19 positive patients.

The present study aims to understand the leisure activities of Portuguese university students during the period of confinement caused by COVID-19 pandemic. This context gives relevance to the analysis of the impacts and changes regarding leisure activities that, in some way, also suffered conditioning. There is no doubt that social isolation has had an influence on people's ability to manage their emotions, their routines and, consequently, there were also some effects on physical and mental health. As a result of the objectives and characteristics of our study, we chose a non-probabilistic \\"snowball\\" sampling modality, with the application of an online survey. The responses of the participants (n = 313) were studied from a quantitative approach, investigating leisure practices during the defined period and their sociodemographic characteristics. The results show that most of those who responded do, with some regularity, practice physical exercise in their homes (36.1%). Regarding their free time, the inquisitees watch movies or series (53.4%), listen to music (67.7%), and are busy with domestic tasks (44.4%). Shopping (32.6%) and bricolage activities (50.8%) are, however, not a considerable part of the occupation of their free time. These results may be related to the fact that our sample is composed by university students and these activities are not part of their daily routines.

For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.

Recent and past studies have used different types of waste to stabilize soil and reduce environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of studies on the combined use of marble dust, rice-husk ash, and saw dust in expansive shale soil. The current study tries to overcome such a gap in the literature, studying the effect of marble dust, rice-husk ash, and saw dust on expansive shales compaction characteristics and permeability properties. According to unified soil classification and the AAHTO classification system, the geotechnical properties of natural soil are classified as clay of high plasticity (CH) and A-7-5. Several tests are performed in the laboratory to investigate the compaction characteristics and permeability properties of expansive shale. Moreover, permeability apparatus is used to investigate the permeability properties of soil. In addition, due to the accuracy of the apparatus, the conventional apparatus has been partly modified. The experimental results show that the addition of waste to the soil has significantly improved soil stabilization, increasing permeability and decreasing plasticity indexes. In addition, there is a gradual decrease in the dry density of soil and an increase in the permeability of stabilized soil. Based on the outcomes of the current study, it claims and concludes that these waste materials can be used as soil stabilizers or modifiers, instead of being dumped in landfill, which will provide a green, friendly, and sustainable environment.

In this study, vegetation surveys and analysis of snow conditions were undertaken in forest stands at various stages of recovery from clear\\\\cutting. The variation in abundance and growth of understory species edible by reindeer, such as lichen, was noted as forests matured. The barrier effect of ice lenses in the snow was also measured in these stands. Lichen biomass was significantly affected by a combination of stand maturity, understory vegetation height, and lichen height. Soil disturbance from the processes of felling and competition in the vegetation communities recovering from this disturbance were identified as key drivers of change in lichen biomass. Overall, clear\\\\cut forests had some of the greatest prevalence of ice lenses in the snow column, and forage availability at these sites was up to 61% less than in mature stands over 58 years in age. It is suggested that alternative silviculture methods are investigated for use in this reindeer herding region, as frequent clear\\\\cutting and consequent reduction in the average forest stand age and maturity class may be detrimental to reindeer grazing, reducing both abundance of forage, and access to it during winter.","output":"Abundance and accessibility of forage for reindeer in forests of Northern Sweden: Impacts of landscape and winter climate regime"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Last year we planned and created our own burn camp We saw a need not being served and jumped in a created a camp experience that was archived in a documentary and received stellar reviews by all who attended The kids' camp expectations was exceeded and everyone was looking forward to 2020 We planned for a great 2020 camp experience and then COVID struck We debated about the safety to proceed with residential camp as we knew it Other camps cancelled but our inner need to serve wouldn't let us do this Methods Our planning committee quickly shifted and began planning for how we can bring that experience to a virtual platform We engaged our Facebook group and called every kid on our list to inform the parents of the change We then created a daily schedule and purchased the items needed for all activities We then sent or delivered these with a gift card to kids that couldn't make the pickups Pickups were scheduled in the cities where most of our kids reside We conducted daily yoga and meditation, cooking classes, painting and campfire stories We mixed daily online sessions with 3 tailgating meet ups We invited guest lectures and left the virtual space open for the kids to hang out Results At the final tailgate/virtual pizza party, we had an awards ceremony and received testimonials from kids and parents about how for the first-time siblings were able to participate We delivered to 15 kids and had 20 attend the tailgate pickups On average, we had 16 kids attend daily Conclusions Parents could see how their child benefitted from this community and the intent of camp This event revealed exactly where our patients reside from a socioeconomic standpoint Deliveries to some homes left our volunteers in tears This helped explain the discrepancy between interest expressed and the numbers that showed daily for events It also made us recognize that camp means even more as it is an escape from their realities","output":"508 Cancel Burn Camp: No Way!

Only a few of the libraries grasped the opportunity to highlight their role in the promotion of public health by providing timely and reliable information.Practical implicationsLibrary leaders who are looking to harness the power of social media for service promotion and outreach should build a strategy that takes platform popularity, current social media trends, patron preferences and the specific promotional objectives of their library into consideration.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, the current research is the first which attempts to explore the social media presence of Greek libraries of all types and changes made to library operations and social media use in response to the COVID-19 lockdown.","output":"COVID-19 and library social media use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic software plagiarism detection tools are widely used in educational settings to ensure that submitted work was not copied. These tools have grown in use together with the rise in enrollments in computer science programs and the widespread availability of code on-line. Educators rely on the robustness of plagiarism detection tools; the working assumption is that the effort required to evade detection is as high as that required to actually do the assigned work. This paper shows this is not the case. It presents an entirely automatic program transformation approach, Mossad, that defeats popular software plagiarism detection tools. Mossad comprises a framework that couples techniques inspired by genetic programming with domain-specific knowledge to effectively undermine plagiarism detectors. Mossad is effective at defeating four plagiarism detectors, including Moss and JPlag. Mossad is both fast and effective: it can, in minutes, generate modified versions of programs that are likely to escape detection. More insidiously, because of its non-deterministic approach, Mossad can, from a single program, generate dozens of variants, which are classified as no more suspicious than legitimate assignments. A detailed study of Mossad across a corpus of real student assignments demonstrates its efficacy at evading detection. A user study shows that graduate student assistants consistently rate Mossad-generated code as just as readable as authentic student code. This work motivates the need for both research on more robust plagiarism detection tools and greater integration of naturally plagiarism-resistant methodologies like code review into computer science education.","output":"Mossad: Defeating Software Plagiarism Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For decades, carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, most notably the acetazolamide-bearing 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety, have been exploited at high altitudes to alleviate acute mountain sickness, a syndrome of symptomatic sensitivity to the altitude characterized by nausea, lethargy, headache, anorexia, and inadequate sleep. Therefore, inhibition of CA may be a promising therapeutic strategy for high-altitude disorders. In this study, co-crystallized inhibitors with 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1,3-benzothiazole, and 1,2,5-oxadiazole scaffolds were employed for pharmacophore-based virtual screening of the ZINC database, followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies against CA to find possible ligands that may emerge as promising inhibitors. Compared to the co-crystal ligands of PDB-1YDB, 6BCC, and 6IC2, ZINC12336992, ZINC24751284, and ZINC58324738 had the highest docking scores of ?9.0, ?9.0, and ?8.9 kcal/mol, respectively. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis of 100 ns was conducted to verify the interactions of the top-scoring molecules with CA. The systems backbone revealed minor fluctuations, indicating that the CACligand complex was stable during the simulation period. Simulated trajectories were used for the MM-GBSA analysis, showing free binding energies of ?16.00  0.19, ?21.04  0.17, and ?19.70  0.18 kcal/mol, respectively.

FINDINGS: Immunization of 129S2 and K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice with the mRNA-1273 vaccine protected against weight loss, lung infection, and lung pathology after challenge with the B.1.621 or WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain. Similarly, immunization of 129S2 mice and Syrian hamsters with a high dose of Ad26.COV2.S reduced lung infection after B.1.621 virus challenge.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.","output":"Evidence for structural protein damage and membrane lipid remodeling in red blood cells from COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess the knowledge of medical students in Lom about these means of screening for prostate cancer in a context of limited resources and controversy about prostate cancer screening, and to identify the determinants associated with these results.

The proposed method allows the robot to take an active clear path action towards the elevator whilst a crowd of people stands at the entrance of the elevator wherein there are still lots of space.

This is increasingly relevant in the MurrayCDarling Basin, Australia, particularly since the introduction of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). This invasive species now occupies up to ninety per cent of fish biomass, with hugely detrimental impacts on native fauna and flora. To address the ongoing impacts of carp, cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) has been proposed as a potentially effective biological control agent. Crucially, however, it is unknown whether CyHV-3 and other cyprinid herpesviruses already exist in the MurrayCDarling. Further, little is known about those viruses that naturally occur in wild freshwater fauna, and the frequency with which these viruses jump species boundaries. To document the evolution and diversity of freshwater fish viromes and better understand the ecological context to the proposed introduction of CyHV-3, we performed a meta-transcriptomic viral survey of invasive and native fish across the MurrayCDarling Basin, covering over 2,200 km of the river system. Across a total of thirty-six RNA libraries representing ten species, we failed to detect CyHV-3 nor any closely related viruses. Rather, meta-transcriptomic analysis identified eighteen vertebrate-associated viruses that could be assigned to the Arenaviridae, Astroviridae, Bornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Chuviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, and a further twenty-seven that were deemed to be associated with non-vertebrate hosts. Notably, we revealed a marked lack of viruses that are shared among invasive and native fish sampled here, suggesting that there is little virus transmission from common carp to native fish species, despite co-existing for over fifty years. Overall, this study provides the first data on the viruses naturally circulating in a major river system and supports the notion that fish harbour a large diversity of viruses with often deep evolutionary histories.","output":"Metagenomic sequencing reveals a lack of virus exchange between native and invasive freshwater fish across the MurrayCDarling Basin, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Session introduction How did COVID - 19 affect the work of Occupational Health nursing in various countries around the world","output":"Special Session 24 The work of an occupational health nurse in various countries during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Patients with COVID-19 disease develop respiratory insufficiency, 5% of which needs ICU treatment Describe the experience of a tertiary hospital in the nutrition treatment during this pandemic Methods: Retrospective study including COVID-19 patients from 5 ICU units of our hospital that needed medical nutrition treatment (MNT) Collected variables: sex, age, BMI, underlying diseases, time from hospitalisation to ICU admission, type of respiratory support, caloric and protein requirements (25 kcal/kg adjusted body weight(ABW), 1 3 g/kg ABW/day), MNT type (enteral nutrition (EN), parenteral nutrition (PN), mixed EN+PN), total calories (including propofol) and proteins administered, percentage of caloric and protein goal in ICU day 4th and 7th, metabolic complications, kidney failure, mortality Results: 139patients were included (74 8% men), 59 613 8 years, BMI 29 95 3 kg/m2 Comorbidities: 52 3% overweight, 38 6% obesity, 47 5% hypertension, 43 9% dyslipidaemia, 18 7% diabetes 82 7% required mechanical ventilation (90 4% of whom pronation), 3 6% ECMO Hospitalisation to ICU admission time: 3 34 3 days 12 2% EN, 29 5% PN, 51 8% mixed EN+PN Caloric and protein requirements: 1773252 kcal and 91 717 g Table 1 presents total calories and proteins administered at day 4th and 7th 61 9% and 8 6% patients had low levels of P and Mg in the first week, 74 1% hyperglycaemia, 7 9% hypoglycaemia, 70 5% hypertriglyceridemia (23 5% &gt;500 mg/dl), 25 9% AKF and 10 8% KRT, 31 7% mortality 5 patients are still in ICU ICU length of stay was 21 815 7 days [Formula presented] Conclusion: Most of our patients reached estimated caloric and protein target at day 4th and 7th of ICU PN was necessary in most of our sample in the first week to reach nutritional requirements We observed a high rate of metabolic complications which requires close monitoring of nutritional treatment References: Clinical Nutrition 38 (2019) 48-79 Disclosure of Interest: None declared","output":"Nutritional treatment in critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease: Spanish experience in a nniversity hospital (Extended)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent years have witnessed an increasing use of coordinated accounts on social media, operated by misinformation campaigns to influence public opinion and manipulate social outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the misinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various drawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on predefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the natural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection framework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when modeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point process, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based on how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2) the prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to be efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We further apply our model on a COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets dataset. The detection result suggests the presence of suspicious coordinated efforts on spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"VigDet: Knowledge Informed Neural Temporal Point Process for Coordination Detection on Social Media (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) was built and maintained to support research into cancers in individuals infected with the HIV by providing specimens at no charge.

OBJECTIVE: To study the demographic and clinical presentations of COVID-19 with their types including MIS-C and Kawasaki among children who were admitted to Doctor Jamal Ahmad Rashid Pediatric Teaching Hospital (DJARPTH) at Sulaimaniyah city, Iraq. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from June to December 2020 in which 50 cases suspected of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study that was admitted at the first visit to the emergency department of DJARPTH and their age ranged between 3 months to 14 years. Then, the collected data were divided into 3 groups: COVID-19, Kawasaki disease (KD), and MIS-C. RESULTS: The fever was the most common presented symptom in all cases with COVID-19 regardless of the severity. COVID-19 may be presented as KD as well as MIS-C. There is an increase in the number of Kawasaki cases since 2019 by 6.7 fold due to the increased number of COVID-19 cases in children. Death was more related to MIS-C and primary COVID-19 diseases. Most COVID-19 cases presented with pericardial effusion; although coronary involvement and LV dysfunction mostly seen with MIS-C cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is not uncommon in pediatric patients and it presents as either primary, MIS-C, and KD.

We evaluated patients' adherence to GRMT following AMI and the association with long-term (up-to 10 years) mortality, healthcare resource utilization and costs. METHODS AMI patients hospitalized in a tertiary medical center in Israel that survived at least a year following post-discharge and enrolled in the two largest health plans were analyzed. Data were obtained from computerized medical records. Patients were defined as adherent when 80 % of the GRMT prescriptions were issue during the first post-discharge year. Hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, primary care utilization and outpatient consulting clinic and other ambulatory services expenditure were calculated annually. RESULTS Overall 8287 patients qualified for the study (mean age 65.0  13.6 years, 69.7 % males).

Although these and other deceptions of the public for profit might be unethical, they are legal. This Article explores the question of why. There are two key components to this analysis, one centered on tort law and the other on the First Amendment. This Article will focus only on tort law aspects. This Article discusses how fraud law developed to focus almost exclusively on personal deceptions while almost entirely ignoring impersonal deceptions like deceptions of the public. As a result, there is most often no tort remedy available to individuals harmed by misinfodemics. This Article prescribes a fix for this gap in the law: treat fraud on the public like any other fraud by prohibiting misinformation and punishing those who spread it. Precedent and policy support imposing civil remedies against those who purposefully or recklessly mislead the public for gain. The important First Amendment aspects of this issue will be addressed in future scholarship.","output":"Fraud Law and Misinfodemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IN TEXAS, COVID-19 outbreaks have been especially pronounced in three types of facilities: nursing homes, jails or prisons, and meatpacking plants The Amarillo area has plenty of all three But it was the meatpacking plants that drew national attention to Amarillo's COVID-19 problems The city, which straddles Potter and Randall counties, has numerous plants that employ 12,000 to 15,000 people In early April, Amarillo's two hospitals began filling up with COVID-19 patients who worked at a plant in neighboring Moore County Two weeks later, workers from a plant in Potter County flooded in","output":"Surge Response: How the Panhandle Handled One of the State's Biggest COVID-19 Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: College students endorse high rates of mental health problems. While many colleges offer on-campus services, many students who could benefit from mental health services do not receive care. Indeed, nearly half of students who screen positive for depression, for example, do not receive treatment. Digital mental health programs, such as those delivered via mobile apps, may help expand access to mental health care and resources. This mixed-methods study aims to examine the uptake and effectiveness of an implementation of IntelliCare for College Students, a self-guided app-based mental health platform, on two university campuses. METHODS: Data on counseling center utilization was collected prior to the implementation of the app (pre-implementation phase) and while the app was available on campus (implementation phase). Data on app usage was collected throughout the implementation phase. A subset of participants (n = 20), along with counseling center staff members (n = 10), completed feedback interviews. RESULTS: Overall, uptake of the app platform was low. A total of 117 participants downloaded the app and registered their study ID during the implementation phase. Approximately 24% (28/117) of participants used the app only once. The number of days between the first and last day of app use ranged from 0 to 299, with a mean of 35.01 days and a median of 14 days. A relatively small portion of the sample (26.5%; 31/117) downloaded one or more of the IntelliCare interactive apps. In examining counseling center utilization, there were no significant changes in intake appointments, individual therapy sessions, or crisis appointments observed from the pre-implementation phase to the implementation phase of the study. Feedback interviews highlighted the significant level of disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote learning, including challenges disseminating information to students and a preference to spend less time with digital devices outside of class time. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that there is an ongoing need to identify ways to reach college students and support student mental health and wellness for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Uptake and effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app platform for college student mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promethean Particles, which makes nanomaterials using a continuous-flow production process, is collaborating with the healthcare industry to develop new applications for its copper nanoparticles.","output":"Antiviral boost for nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: [18F]-2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT (FDG PET/CT) is a sensitive and quantitative technic for detecting inflammatory process. Glucose uptake is correlated with an increased anaerobic glycolysis seen in activated inflammatory cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. The aim of the study was to assess the inflammatory status at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in non-critically ill patients requiring admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Patients admitted with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. FDG PET/CT was performed from day 6 to day 14 of the onset of symptoms. Depending on FDG PET/CT findings, patients profiles were classified as inflammatory or low inflammatory. FDG PET/CT data were compared with chest CT evolution and short-term clinical outcome. All inflammatory sites were reported to screen potential extra-pulmonary tropism. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Maximum standardized uptake values ranged from 4.7 to 16.3 in lungs. All patients demonstrated increased mediastinal lymph nodes glucose uptake. Three patients (23%) presented mild nasopharyngeal, two patients (15%) bone marrow, and five patients (38%) splenic mild increase in glucose uptake. No patient had significant digestive focal or segmental glucose uptake. There was no significant physiological myocardial glucose uptake in all patients except one. There was no correlation between PET lung inflammatory status and chest CT evolution or short-term clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory process at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in COVID-19 patients is obvious in FDG PET/CT scans. Glucose uptake is heterogeneous and typically focused on lungs.

Neuropsychological assessment is important to neuro-oncology care yet challenging to complete outside of a structured testing environment. Teleneuropsychology (TNP) has been explored in limited populations and proven feasible and reliable. Conducting TNP visits directly to patients' home (DTH) had minimal prior study. METHODS: We used two voluntary surveys to examine acceptance (patients) and feasibility (providers) of DTH-TNP at two regionally diverse medical institutions providing neuropsychological services to neuro-oncology patients from April to September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were scheduled during the study period, 79 of whom completed neuropsychological testing via DTH-TNP. Neuropsychology providers completed surveys on 68 of these encounters (86%). In 98% of cases, neuropsychologists were able to achieve or partially achieve the individually defined goals of their assessment. Common problems reported included patient dysregulation (16%) and slow/unreliable internet (15%). Of the 52 patients who responded, 98% were satisfied with the DTH-TNP experience and 92% would recommend the virtual visit to others. All respondents felt understood by the examiner (100%) and the majority denied technical difficulties (90%), communication challenges (94%), or privacy concerns (98%). Patients reported reduced risk of infection and saved travel time as favorable aspects of DTH-TNP. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest neuro-oncology patients find DTH-TNP acceptable and neuropsychologists find it a feasible practice, while also recognizing its limitations. Results suggest that further study of DTH-TNP (e.g., reliability, validity) for neuro-oncology patients is warranted.","output":"Cancer, Cognition, and COVID: Delivering Direct-to-Home Tele-Neuropsychology Services to Neuro-Oncology Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of digestive symptoms may vary depending on doctors' professional backgrounds when they inquired suspected COVID-19 patients in a fever clinic We sought to understand the characteristics of inquiries about digestive symptoms by doctors in different specialties;therefore, inquiry records of 2 gastroenterologists and 6 nongastroenterologists were reviewed We compared the difference in inquiry of digestive symptoms (diarrhea, vomit, distension, anorexia, and abdominal pain) between these two groups among identified COVID-19 patients And we further compared the difference of digestive symptoms between confirmed patients and suspected cases who excluded from COVID-19 Among 495 confirmed COVID-19 cases (254 cases by gastroenterologists and 241 cases by nongastroenterologists), 22 83% patients experienced various digestive symptoms in the gastroenterologists' group, while only 4 47% reported digestive symptoms by nongastroenterologists (p &lt; 0 0001) Additionally, among initially suspected 611 patients who presented with similar respiratory symptoms inquired by gastroenterologists, confirmed cases presented far more frequency of digestive symptoms than excluded cases (22 8% vs 3 64%, p &lt; 0 0001) Furthermore, confirmed patients reported more percentage of watery diarrhea (56% vs 36%, p &lt; 0 0001) and higher frequent vomit (2 77 +/- 0 97 vs 1 80 +/- 0 45 per day, p = 0 041) than excluded cases We concluded that gastroenterologists could detect a greater proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during fever clinic inquiries Moreover, confirmed COVID-19 patients are more likely to have higher severity in digestive symptoms than excluded cases Therefore, physicians in fever clinic should pay more attention to the triage of gastrointestinal symptoms","output":"Gastroenterologists Reveal More Digestive Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients than Nongastroenterologists in Fever Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19.

After experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% had the willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% want to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetable intake. 37.9% had the willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% want to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline of dietary and behavioral habits and willingness to change their habits were observed between the frontline epidemic prevention worker and others(P<0.05). However, for the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits, the frontline epidemic prevention experience might be a promoting factor to adopt worse dietary and behavioral habits, including the high-salt intake subgroup (OR 2.824, 95% CI 2.341-3.405) and shortest physical exercise time subgroup (OR 1.379, 95% CI 1.041-1.828).Interpretation: The dietary and behavior habits of the frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than others before COVID-19.

On two benchmark disease datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs.

PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application.

This completes the sequence of the entire genome of strain CV777, which was found to be 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length (excluding the poly A-tail). A cloning strategy, which involves primers based on conserved regions in the predicted ORF1 products from other coronaviruses whose genome sequence has been determined, was used to amplify the equivalent, but as yet unknown, sequence of PEDV. Primary sequences derived from these products were used to design additional primers resulting in the amplification and sequencing of the entire ORF1 of PEDV. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed a small open reading frame (ORF) located near the 5 end (no 99C137), and two large, slightly overlapping ORFs, ORF1a (nt 297C12650) and ORF1b (nt 12605C20641). The ORF1a and ORF1b sequences overlapped at a potential ribosomal frame shift site. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested the presence of several functional motifs within the putative ORF1 protein. By analogy to other coronavirus replicase gene products, three protease and one growth factor-like motif were seen in ORF1a, and one polymerase domain, one metal ion-binding domain, and one helicase motif could be assigned within ORF1b. Comparative amino acid sequence alignments revealed that PEDV is most closely related to human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and less related to murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).

The case is set on July 7, 2020, as the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index reached a 29-month high. This new high was the result of the Chinese government's efforts to stabilize financial markets after COVID-19 hit, as well as to calm concerns about capital flight because of new security legislation in Hong Kong. Students take on the role of J.P. Morgan's Hong KongCbased chief economist, Hai Bin Zhu, in preparing to present his outlook on the prospects for investment in China overall and relative to other potential investment geographies, such as the United States and financial markets around the globe. The case covers the development of China's financial system over the past four decades, focusing on the banking system, equity and debt markets, and the structure of household assets. Special emphasis is placed on the most recent boom and bust cycles of Chinese equities to help students understand the factors suggesting additional equity growth (the case for a bull market) and retraction (the case for a bear market). Additionally, the government responses to these most recent bull and bear market cycles are described, helping students develop intuition about how the government might react to future events. This preparation will enable students to answer questions that participants on the call would likely ask: How would COVID-19 affect the investment opportunities in China, and how did China's markets compare to markets in the United States and the rest of the world?

It jumped by 6%, capping a 16.5% rise over the previous eight straight trading sessions. This followed the Chinese government's efforts to stabilize financial markets after COVID-19 hit, as well as to calm concerns about capital flight because of new security legislation in Hong Kong. From his office at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank headquarters in Hong Kong, Hai Bin Zhu considered these developments and the strong recent performance of the Chinese stock market. In particular, he wondered what investment advice he should give to investment professionals and clients of J.P. Morgan on a Zoom call that was to take place that morning. As the Chief China Economist and Head of Greater China Economic Research, Hai Bin had a responsibility to interpret these important events. As he prepared for the call, he pondered the events of the past 12 years (Exhibit1A): the record returns of 2008 and 2015, the more stable growth of 2018 and 2019, and the most recent COVID-19-related decline and subsequent spike in 2020.

We analyzed data on adults age 60+ from the Health and Retirement Study, looking at the Great Recession (2008) as a predictor of what to expect in the next decade of pandemic recovery. A key finding was that food insecurity more than doubled among older adults during the Great Recession and remained elevated even 10 years later. Regression analyses showed that SNAP use among older adults weakened the relationship between poverty and food insecurity, but didnt eliminate it17% of older adults still reported food insecurity two years after enrolling in SNAP. The data indicates that a growing share of older SNAP users benefits have not kept up with rising food costs.

The aims of this study were to assess whether HBP is involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, if so, whether it can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test. METHODS: This was a prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers in patients admitted to Sk?ne University hospital in Sweden with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72h after admission, during hospital stay and at discharge. Plasma HBP concentrations samples were measured both with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Joinstar) point-of-care test. RESULTS: Thirty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients had blood samples taken within 72h after admission. We compared the highest HBP value taken within 72h after admission in patients who eventually developed organ dysfunction (n = 23) compared to those who did not (n = 6), and found that HBP was significantly elevated in those who developed organ dysfunction (25.0 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 16.6-48.5) vs 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.8-21.7 ng/mL), p = 0.03). Point-of-care test measurements correlated well with ELISA measurements (R = 0.83). HBP measured by the POC device predicted development of COVID-induced organ dysfunction with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: HBP is elevated prior to onset of organ dysfunction in patients with severe COVID-19 using a newly developed point-of-care test and hence HBP could be used in a clinical setting as a prognostic marker in COVID-19.","output":"Heparin binding protein in severe COVID-19-A prospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown and social distancing measures during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic increase women's responsibilities and influence their mental health.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant women's right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physician's desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical consequences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treatments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patient's own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed.","output":"Balancing risks: making decisions for maternal treatment without data on fetal safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome that is called COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG.

I discuss how the lecture performances in the series problematised and tried to resist the commodification and hegemonisation of knowledge under cognitive capitalism. Drawing on Liam Gillick's conception of the artists as the 'ultimate freelance knowledge worker', I argue that lecture performances are emblematic of a cultural market that mobilises artistic processes as artistic products and has them stand-in for more financially and temporally costly productions. As the global pandemic has put these conventional productions on hold, this moment presents an ideal opportunity to investigate artists as cognitive workers and to appreciate the ramifications that surround their status as such.","output":"Share Your Work: Lola Arias's Lecture Performance Series and the Artistic Cognitariat of the Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the lifetime of coronavirus infected droplets under a stick-slip evaporation mode has been investigated, which may play a pivotal role in reducing the spread of COVID-19 infection. It is showed that the survival time of the virus can be reduced by increasing the receding contact angle or by reducing the initial contact angle of a drop deposited on a solid surface. It has been found that the lifetime of the virus increases almost five times under highly humid conditions as compared to dry conditions. It is further observed that the normalized lifetime does not depend upon thermo-physical properties, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and initial drop volume. A model has been proposed to estimate the shear stress acting on a virus taking into account the effect of a Marangoni flow. The presented model unveils that the magnitude of computed shear stress is not enough to obliterate the virus. The findings of the present model have been discussed in the context of reducing the COVID-19 infection, but the model can also be applied for coughed/sneezed droplets of other infectious diseases. Moreover, this physical understanding of evaporation dynamics on solid surfaces with a stick-slip mode may help in better design of a face mask, PPE kit, and other protective equipment used in public places in order to minimize the chances of infection and tackle the current pandemic. However, the reported model for estimating the survival time of the virus does not consider the effect of the thermo-capillary convection (the Marangoni effect).","output":"Insight on the evaporation dynamics in reducing the COVID-19 infection triggered by respiratory droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of surgical-type face masks has become increasingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings suggest that it is harder to categorise the facial expressions of masked faces, than of unmasked faces. To date, studies of the effects of mask-wearing on emotion recognition have used categorisation paradigms: authors have presented facial expression stimuli and examined participants ability to attach the correct label (e.g., happiness, disgust). While the ability to categorise particular expressions is important, this approach overlooks the fact that expression intensity is also informative during social interaction. For example, when predicting an interactants future behaviour, it is useful to know whether they are slightly fearful or terrified, contented or very happy, slightly annoyed or angry. Moreover, because categorisation paradigms force observers to pick a single label to describe their percept, any additional dimensionality within observers interpretation is lost. In the present study, we adopted a complementary emotion-intensity rating paradigm to study the effects of mask-wearing on expression interpretation. In an online experiment with 120 participants (82 female), we investigated how the presence of face masks affects the perceived emotional profile of prototypical expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. For each of these facial expressions, we measured the perceived intensity of all six emotions. We found that the perceived intensity of intended emotions (i.e., the emotion that the actor intended to convey) was reduced by the presence of a mask for all expressions except for anger. Additionally, when viewing all expressions except surprise, masks increased the perceived intensity of non-intended emotions (i.e., emotions that the actor did not intend to convey). Intensity ratings were unaffected by presentation duration (500ms vs 3000ms), or attitudes towards mask wearing. These findings shed light on the ambiguity that arises when interpreting the facial expressions of masked faces.","output":"How does the presence of a surgical face mask impair the perceived intensity of facial emotions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19, acts of heroism C particularly by ordinary people from below C have been foregrounded, prompting complicated ethical issues in the public health context By analysing examples from a large corpus of films about epidemics across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, this article investigates how cinema has represented public health workers We find that the public health worker in epidemic-related films tends to be elite or an authority figure with expertise, often male C whose personal burden and sacrifice goes unrecognised by others, or even directly challenged from below However, although the public health worker as ordinary hero rarely features, the human side of epidemiologists, physicians and bacteriologists C through either personal redemption and a return to more humble roots, or recognition of personal error, questioning of official regulations and authorities, and eccentric and unorthodox behaviour C makes these elite figures appear more ordinary, bridging the gap between the two [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Visual Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Epidemics, public health workers, and heroism in cinematic perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to compare the occurrence and nuisance of adverse events following administration of each COVID-19 vaccine dose between two groups: individuals given three doses of mRNA vaccine (homologous group, 3  mRNA, n = 252) and those given two doses of adenoviral vector vaccine further boosted with mRNA vaccine (heterologous group, 2  AZ + 1  mRNA, n = 205). Although the studied groups differed significantly in the frequency and number of side effects after the first and second vaccine dose, no relevant differences were seen following the booster administration.

In the homologous group, female sex, lower BMI, and no history of regular influenza vaccination were associated with a higher frequency of side effects of a booster dose. In the heterologous group, the history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased number of side effects seen after a booster. In both groups, the number of side effects related to the first and second dose correlated with the number observed after administration of a booster dose. Individuals receiving a homologous booster reported a higher nuisance of side effects than the heterologous group. It was similar to the level reported after the second dose in both groups.

Data is collected all over the world and needs to be integrated and made available to other researchers quickly. However, the various heterogeneous information systems that are used in hospitals can result in fragmentation of health data over multiple data 'silos' that are not interoperable for analysis. Consequently, clinical observations in hospitalised patients are not prepared to be reused efficiently and timely. There is a need to adapt the research data management in hospitals to make COVID-19 observational patient data machine actionable, i.e. more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for humans and machines. We therefore applied the FAIR principles in the hospital to make patient data more FAIR. In this paper, we present our FAIR approach to transform COVID-19 observational patient data collected in the hospital into machine actionable digital objects to answer medical doctors' research questions. With this objective, we conducted a coordinated FAIRification among stakeholders based on ontological models for data and metadata, and a FAIR based architecture that complements the existing data management. We applied FAIR Data Points for metadata exposure, turning investigational parameters into a FAIR dataset. We demonstrated that this dataset is machine actionable by means of three different computational activities: federated query of patient data along open existing knowledge sources across the world through the Semantic Web, implementing Web APIs for data query interoperability, and building applications on top of these FAIR patient data for FAIR data analytics in the hospital. Our work demonstrates that a FAIR research data management plan based on ontological models for data and metadata, open Science, Semantic Web technologies, and FAIR Data Points is providing data infrastructure in the hospital for machine actionable FAIR digital objects.

Because of sub-optimal oxygen supply to the tissues, as a negative impact of anemia fish will experience reduced growth and poor health. This health challenge may be linked with several factors including anthropogenic changes in the marine environment, infectious etiology (viral, bacterial, and parasitic), nutritional deficiencies, or hemorrhaging. From the mid-late summer of 2017 to 2019, Scottish salmon farming companies began to report the occurrence of anemic events in open-net marine sites. At that time, the industry had little understanding of the pathogenesis and possible mechanisms of anemia and limited the ability to formulate effective mitigation strategies. Clinical examination of fish raised suspicion of anemia and this was confirmed by generating a packed cell volume value by centrifugation of a microhematocrit tube of whole anticoagulated blood. Company health team members, including vets and biologists, reported discoloration of gills and local hemorrhages. This paper reviews various commercially significant cases and lesser-known cases of anemia in cultured salmonid species induced by various biological factors. The current methods available to assess hematology are addressed and some future methods that could be adopted in modern day fish farming are identified. An account of the most recent anemic event in Scottish farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is presented and discussed as a case study from information provided by two major Scottish salmon producers. The percent of total marine sites (n = 80) included in this case study, that reported with suspected or clinical anemia covering the period mid-late summer 2017 to 2019, was between 1 and 13%.

All of the subjects visited the laboratory to complete the following intervention in a randomized order on 5 separate days; (a) non-stretching (control), (b) static stretching of the quadriceps muscles, (c) static stretching of the hamstring muscles, (d) dynamic stretching of the quadriceps muscles, and (e) dynamic stretching of the hamstring muscles. Static stretching exercises either for the quadriceps or the hamstring muscles were carried out at the standing and sitting positions. Subjects performed four successive repetitions of each stretching exercises for 30 seconds in both stretching positions.

In this context, severe COVID-19 shares common characteristics with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is commonly characterized by genetic susceptibility, and presents with thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and organ damage (renal, neurological, cardiac). Aims: We hypothesized that genetic susceptibility would be also evident in patients with severe COVID-19 and would be associated with disease severity. Methods: We prospectively studied consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in our referral centers (April-May 2020). Diagnosis was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). COVID-19 severity was assessed based on World Health Organization's (WHO) criteria into moderate/severe, and critical disease. Additional data on patients' history and course were recorded by treating physicians that followed patients up to discharge or death. Patients' DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples. Probes were designed using the Design studio (Illumina). Amplicons cover exonic regions of TMA-associated genes (Complement factor H/CFH, CFH-related, CFI, CFB, CFD, C3, CD55, C5, MCP, thombomodulin/THBD, ADAMTS13) spanning 15 bases into the intronic regions. We used 10ng of initial DNA material. Libraries were quantified using Qubit and sequenced on a MiniSeq System in a 2x150 bp run. Analysis was performed using the TruSeq Amplicon application (BaseSpace). Alignment was based on the banded Smith-Waterman algorithm in the targeted regions (specified in a manifest file). We performed variant calling with the Illumina-developed Somatic Variant Caller in germline mode and variant allele frequency higher than 20%. Both Ensembl and Refseq were used for annotation of the output files. Variants clinical significance was based on ClinVar and the current version of the Complement Database, as we have previously described. Results: We studied 60 patients, 40 with moderate/severe disease hospitalized in COVID-19 general ward (GW) and 20 with critical disease hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU). Among them, 11 patients succumbed due to COVID-19 disease. Patients laboratory characteristics are shown in Figure. In genetic analysis, patients presented heterogeneous variant profiles including pathogenic, benign, likely benign, and variants of unknown significance (median number of variants: 62, range: 51-89). Search in the Complement Database revealed seven patients, each carrying one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in C3, CD46, DGKE, and CFH. Based on ClinVar, we found a pathogenic variant of ADAMTS13 (rs2301612, missense) in 28 patients. We also detected two missense risk factor variants, previously detected in complement-related diseases: rs2230199 in C3 (13 patients); and rs800292 in CFH (26 patients). Among them, 22 patients had a combination of these characterized variants. This combination was significantly associated with critical disease that required intensive care (p=0.037), as well as low lymphocyte counts (p=0.021) and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.050). In the multivariate model, critical disease was an independent predictor of double heterozygocity in these variants. Furthermore, one patient had a rare germline missense variant in CFI (rs112534524), previously detected in complement-related diseases. This patient suffered from critical disease but survived after long-term ICU hospitalization. Interestingly, five patients showed a likely protective missense variant in CFB (rs641153). Conclusion: We have detected for the first time rare and pathogenic TMA-associated variants in patients with severe COVID-19. Our findings of variants in complement-regulatory genes and ADAMTS13 suggest genetic susceptibility and define proof-of-concept for proper selection of patients that would benefit from complement inhibition.

Here, we sequence-characterized the spike gene from breakthrough infections that corresponded to B.1.617 sublineage. Delineating the functional impact of spike mutations revealed that N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific E156G/157-158 contributed to increased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-induced antibodies. A six-nucleotide deletion (467C472) in the spike-coding region introduced this change in the NTD. We confirmed the presence of E156G/157-158 from cases concurrently screened, in addition to other circulating spike (S1) mutations such as T19R, T95I, L452R, E484Q, and D614G. Notably, E156G/157-158 was present in more than 90% of the sequences reported from the USA and UK in October 2021. The spike-pseudotyped viruses bearing a combination of E156G/157-158 and L452R exhibited higher infectivity and reduced sensitivity to neutralization. Notwithstanding, the post-recovery plasma robustly neutralized viral particles bearing the mutant spike. When the spike harbored E156G/157-158 along with L452R and E484Q, increased cell-to-cell fusion was also observed, suggesting a combinatorial effect of these mutations.

Together the International Osteoporosis Federation and National Osteoporosis Foundation sought to ascertain the impact on osteoporosis management. Methods Questionnaires were electronically circulated to a sample of members of both learned bodies and included information regarding the location and specialty of respondents, current extent of face to face consultations, alterations in osteoporosis risk assessment, telemedicine experience, alterations to medication ascertainment and delivery, and electronic health record (EHR) utilisation. Responses were collected, quantitative data analysed, and qualitative data assessed for recurring themes. Results Responses were received from 209 healthcare workers from 53 countries, including 28% from Europe, 24% from North America, 19% from the Asia Pacific region, 17% from the Middle East, and 12% from Latin America. Most respondents were physicians (85%) with physician assistants, physical therapists and nurses/nurse practitioners represented in the sample. The main three specialties represented included rheumatology (40%), endocrinology (22%) and orthopaedics (15%).In terms of the type of patient contact, 33% of respondents conducted telephone consultations and 21% video consultations. Bone mineral density assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) usage was affected with only 29% able to obtain a scan as recommended. The majority of clinicians (60%) had systems in place to identify patients receiving subcutaneous or intravenous medication, and 43% of clinicians reported difficulty in arranging appropriate osteoporosis medications during the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusion To conclude through surveying a global sample of osteoporosis healthcare professionals, we have observed an increase in telemedicine consultations, delays in DXA scanning, interrupted supply of medications and reductions in intravenous medication delivery.

World Health Organization (WHO) assigned an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codeCOVID-19-as the name of the new disease. Coronaviruses are generally transferred by people and many diverse species of animals, including birds and mammals such as cattle, camels, cats, and bats. Infrequently, the coronavirus can be transferred from animals to humans, and then propagate among people, such as with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and now with this new virus, namely SARS-CoV-2, or human coronavirus. Its rapid spreading has sent billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope up. The COVID-19 outbreak comes along with an exponential growth of new infections, as well as a growing death count. A major goal to limit the further exponential spreading is to slow down the transmission rate, which is denoted by a spread factor (f), and we proposed an algorithm in this study for analyzing the same. This paper addresses the potential of data science to assess the risk factors correlated with COVID-19, after analyzing existing datasets available in ourworldindata.org (Oxford University database), and newly simulated datasets, following the analysis of different univariate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting new cases and resulting deaths. The result shows that vanilla, stacked, and bidirectional LSTM models outperformed multilayer LSTM models. Besides, we discuss the findings related to the statistical analysis on simulated datasets.

However, most diseases also affect animal welfare. We established an approach to quantify the welfare effect of infectious diseases in cattle (three diseases) and pigs (two diseases). A suffering score was established based on the aggregation of severity, duration, and frequency of clinical entities of the diseases. The resulting suffering scores were then used to compare the welfare impact of the different diseases and for comparison to other common welfare hazards. For example, the approach suggested that bovine viral diarrhoea and paratuberculosis are more severe for cattle than infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. In pigs, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome has a much bigger welfare impact than Aujeszkys disease, assuming all diseases remain endemic. ABSTRACT: Control of infectious diseases in livestock has often been motivated by food safety concerns and the economic impact on livestock production. However, diseases may also affect animal welfare. We present an approach to quantify the effect of five infectious diseases on animal welfare in cattle (three diseases) and pigs (two diseases). We grouped clinical manifestations that often occur together into lists of clinical entities for each disease based on literature reviews, and subsequently estimated suffering scores based on an aggregation of duration, frequency, and severity. The duration and severity were based on literature reviews and expert knowledge elicitation, while frequency was based mainly on estimates from the literature. The resulting suffering scores were compared to scores from common welfare hazards found under Danish conditions. Most notably, the suffering scores for cattle diseases were ranked as: bovine viral diarrhoea and infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis > infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and for pigs as: porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome > Aujeszkys disease. The approach has limitations due to the limited data available in literature and uncertainties associated with expert knowledge, but it can provide decision makers with a tool to quantify the impact of infections on animal welfare given these uncertainties.","output":"Application of Methods to Assess Animal Welfare and Suffering Caused by Infectious Diseases in Cattle and Swine Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To provide insights into phage-host interactions during winemaking, we assessed whether phenolic compounds modulate the phage predation of Oenococcus oeni. Centrifugal partition chromatography was used to fractionate the phenolic compounds of a model red wine. The ability of lytic oenophage OE33PA to kill its host was reduced in the presence of two collected fractions in which we identified five compounds. Three, namely, quercetin, myricetin and p-coumaric acid, significantly reduced the phage predation of O. oeni when provided as individual pure molecules, as also did other structurally related compounds such as cinnamic acid. Their presence was correlated with a reduced adsorption rate of phage OE33PA on its host. Strikingly, none of the identified compounds affected the killing activity of the distantly related lytic phage Vinitor162. OE33PA and Vinitor162 were shown to exhibit different entry mechanisms to penetrate into bacterial cells. We propose that ligand-receptor interactions that mediate phage adsorption to the cell surface are diverse in O. oeni and are subject to differential interference by phenolic compounds. Their presence did not induce any modifications in the cell surface as visualized by TEM. Interestingly, docking analyses suggest that quercetin and cinnamic acid may interact with the tail of OE33PA and compete with host recognition.","output":"Wine Phenolic Compounds Differently Affect the Host-Killing Activity of Two Lytic Bacteriophages Infecting the Lactic Acid Bacterium Oenococcus oeni"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with underlying health conditions are at risk for a poor outcome from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As pathogens and pollutants have been found in surgical smoke, we examined the potential for aerosol escape during transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) which may be particularly important given the presence of faecal contamination in the operative workspace and the specifics of its access platforms. METHODS: Both qualitative (thermographic imaging) and quantificative (particle counting) methods were used to assess for aerosol release during TAMIS in comparison to laparoscopic operations of similar duration and equipment both at times of surgical dissection and without. TAMIS was performed using a Gelport Path Device (Applied Medical) and Airseal insufflation with valveless trocar (ConMed). RESULTS: Significant carbon dioxide (CO(2)) escapes during TAMIS carrying with it considerable numbers of particles. In general, particle counts were low prior to tissue dissection phases of the operation but increased substantially (25  10(6)/m(3) or over 40 background counts) during hook cautery dissection. The majority of particles were in the 0.3C0.5 micron range (where counts were increased relative to background between 42 and 65) with the highest relative increase versus background in the 0.5C1.0 micron range. Particle counts < 5 were substantially greater during the TAMIS procedure versus laparoscopic procedures (a laparoscopic-assisted parastomal hernia repair and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) employing similar tools. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable amounts of particle-rich aerosols escape during TAMIS procedures. Although pathogens are not proven to definitely spread to healthcare staff by such material nebulisation, N95/FFP2 masks, at a minimum, seem prudent while other methods evolve to eliminate this risk.

Based on a genomic analysis of the parasites collected from the two cases, the most likely origin of the Plasmodium was Gabon or Cameroon. Further, the parasites collected from the two Belgian patients were identical-by-descent, which supports the assumption that the two infections originated from the bite of the same mosquito, during an interrupted feeding. Despite these cases, airport malaria remains a rare event. Yet, it has significant implications, particularly for the patient, as delayed or missed diagnosis of the cause of illness often results in high rates of complications and mortality.

Lifestyle habits including sleep, eating, exercise, and screen use were modified, potentially exacerbating adverse mental health outcomes. This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle habits and mental health symptoms in paediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Canada. METHODS: An online survey was distributed across Canada to caregivers of children with ADHD (children aged 5 to 18 years) assessing depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), ADHD (SNAP-IV), and lifestyle behaviours. Data were analyzed by gender (male/female) and age category (5 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 18 years). Spearmans correlations between lifestyle habits and mental health outcomes were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 587 surveys were completed. Mean child age was 10.14 years (SD 3.06), including 166 females (28.3%). The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 indicated that 17.4% and 14.1% of children met criteria for moderately severe to severe depression and anxiety symptoms respectively. Children met SNAP-IV cut-off scores for inattention (73.7%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (66.8%), and oppositional defiant disorder (38.6%) behaviours. Caregivers reported changes in sleep (77.5%), eating (58.9%), exercise (83.7%), and screen use (92.9%) in their ADHD child, greatly impacting youth. Sleeping fewer hours/night, eating more processed foods, and watching TV/playing videogames >3.5 hours/day correlated with greater depression, anxiety and ADHD symptoms, and exercising <1 hour/day further correlated with depression symptoms (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in less healthy lifestyle habits and increased mental health symptoms in Canadian children with ADHD. Longitudinal studies to better understand the relationship between these factors are recommended.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle habits and mental health symptoms in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini dilatar belakangi oleh wabah Coronavirus, pandemi Corona merubah aktivitas dunia termasuk pendidikan.

METHODS: This is a prospective, interventional case series of patients with P-CME. Patients presenting with P-CME were given the option of topical IFN therapy against conventional treatment with oral, topical, intravitreal, and periocular steroid therapy and antivascular growth factors. Patients who consented for the same were advised to use the IFN drops four times/day. Commercially available injection IFN alfa-2b was reconstituted to prepare the eye drops (1 MIU/ml). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was done at the baseline and on each review visit until complete resolution of P-CME. RESULTS: Eight eyes of eight patients diagnosed with P-CME were studied. Mean central macular thickness (CMT) on OCT at the presentation (n = 8) and at 4 weeks post topical IFN therapy (n = 6) was 560.1 m (range: 349C702 m) and 344.33 m (range: 250C390 m), respectively. All eyes except one had posterior capsular rent (PCR). Five patients had regular follow-up until resolution. The mean duration of complete first resolution of P-CME was 5 weeks (range: 4C7.1 weeks) in those patients. Relapse was seen in three patients who responded after resuming or continuing the therapy. Case 1 had 9 months follow-up after completion of IFN therapy, and no recurrence was noted. No ocular or systemic side effects related to the topical IFN therapy were noted clinically, except papillary conjunctivitis in one patient.

Here, we describe a live dual-imaging approach to monitor host subcellular acidification and M. tuberculosis intrabacterial pH. By combining this approach with pharmacological and genetic perturbations, we show that M. tuberculosis can maintain its intracellular pH independently of the surrounding pH in human macrophages. Importantly, unlike bedaquiline (BDQ), isoniazid (INH), or rifampicin (RIF), the drug pyrazinamide (PZA) displays antibacterial efficacy by disrupting M. tuberculosis intrabacterial pH homeostasis in cellulo. By using M. tuberculosis mutants, we confirmed that intracellular acidification is a prerequisite for PZA efficacy in cellulo.

One of the benefits of biofuel is reduced environmental impact, including reduction in greenhouse gas emission which causes climate change. Sugarcane is one of the most important bioenergy crops. Sugarcane juice is used to produce table sugar and first-generation biofuel (e.g., bioethanol). Sugarcane bagasse is also a potential material for second-generation cellulosic biofuel production. Researchers worldwide are striving to improve sugarcane biomass yield and quality by a variety of means including biotechnological tools. This paper reviews the use of sugarcane as a feedstock for biofuel production, and gene manipulation tools and approaches, including RNAi and genome-editing tools, such as TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9, for improving its quality. The specific focus here is on CRISPR system because it is low cost, simple in design and versatile compared to other genome-editing tools. The advance of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has transformed plant research with its ability to precisely delete, insert or replace genes in recent years. Lignin is the primary material responsible for biomass recalcitrance in biofuel production. The use of genome editing technology to modify lignin composition and distribution in sugarcane cell wall has been realized.

While highly potent mNAbs have great therapeutic potential, the ability of the virus to mutate and escape recognition and neutralization of mNAbs represents a potential problem in their use for the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2. Studies investigating natural or mNAb-induced antigenic variability in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, and their effects on viral fitness are still rudimentary. In this manuscript we described experimental approaches for the selection, identification, and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody resistant mutants (MARMs) in cultured cells. The ability to study SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift under selective immune pressure by mNAbs is important for the optimal implementation of mNAbs for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. This will help to identify essential amino acid residues in the viral S glycoprotein required for mNAb-mediated inhibition of viral infection, to predict potential natural drift variants that could emerge upon implementation of therapeutic mNAbs, as well as vaccine prophylactic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Soybean depth drops by half for outright futures and by over 90 percent for calendar spreads, and soybean bid-ask spreads increase significantly. This liquidity pullback starts on the night of February 12 to 13, 2020a full two weeks before (i) liquidity evaporates in U.S. bond and equity markets and (ii) soybean prices start to fall sharply.

It was based on a great number of animal studies. However, except for information from animal studies, there are merely any data of human studies for reference. METHODS: This study was conducted by a unique database including 1.6 million diabetic patients. From 1999 to 2013, a total of 145,327 type 2 diabetic patients, first admitted for sepsis, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was conducted in a 1 : 5 ratio between pioglitazone users and nonusers. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of hospital mortality in pioglitazone users. Further stratification analysis was done and KaplanCMeier plot was used. RESULTS: A total of 9,310 sepsis pioglitazone users (defined as ever use of pioglitazone in any dose within 3 months prior to the first admission for sepsis) and 46,550 matched nonusers were retrieved, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the cohort of pioglitazone users (9,310) had a decreased aOR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89C1.02) of sepsis mortality.

The main treatment regimen currently in use requires a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic process to determine disease stage and hospital admission for drug administration. Fexinidazole is a new oral treatment for stage 1 and non-severe stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis. The World Health Organization has recently incorporated fexinidazole into its treatment guidelines for human African trypanosomiasis. The treatment does not require hospital admission or a lumbar puncture for all patients, which is likely to ease access for patients; however, it does require concomitant food intake, which is likely to reduce adherence. Here, we use a mathematical model calibrated to case and screening data from Mushie territory, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to explore the potential negative impact of poor compliance to an oral treatment, and potential gains to be made from increases in the rate at which patients seek treatment. We find that reductions in compliance in treatment of stage 1 cases are projected to result in the largest increase in further transmission of the disease, with failing to cure stage 2 cases also posing a smaller concern. Reductions in compliance may be offset by increases in the rate at which cases are passively detected. Efforts should therefore be made to ensure good adherence for stage 1 patients to treatment with fexinidazole and to improve access to care.","output":"Modelling the impact of fexinidazole use on human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) is an innovative preference learning approach.

Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two.

However, school plays an important role in the development of social, intellectual, and mental competencies and can counteract the negative effects of adverse life events on learning and early school dropout. In this study, we investigated how the unusual context of school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic affected school engagement. Specifically, we focused on inter-individual differences in the motivational determinants of school engagement. We thus performed an online survey of 170 students focusing on the time spent on mathematics assignments, motivation regulation, implicit theories of intelligence, such as adopting a growth or a fixed mindset about his/her intellectual abilities, and optimism. Importantly, the students participated in the online survey during the first lockdown period, with schools closed (T1), and the second lockdown period, with schools remaining open (T2). During T1, identified motivation positively predicted the time spent on math homework assignments: the more the students thought that working on math exercises was useful for their future life, the more time they spent studying. Importantly, the link between identified motivation and school engagement was specific to T1, when schools were closed, as indicated by a significant interaction between identified motivations by type of lockdown. These results suggest that having self-determined motivation is of particular importance when students are deprived of social and intellectual interactions with classmates and teachers.

A univariate analysis was performed with the Pearson correlation and a multivariate analysis with multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 505,224 patient visits were included in this study. On univariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between T and the ED volume (r = 0.012, p = 0.608), but there was a significant correlation between deltaT and ED volume (r = 0.109, p<0.001).

In this study, the genetic diversity of the RSV strains was investigated among nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) taken from children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with ALRTIs in Hospital Serdang, Malaysia. A total of 165 NPA samples were tested for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses from June until December 2009. RSV was found positive in 83 (50%) of the samples using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further classification of 67 RSV strains showed that subgroups A and B comprised 11/67 (16.4%) and 56/67 (83.6%) of the strains, respectively. The second hypervariable region at the carboxyl-terminal of the G gene was amplified and sequenced in order to do phylogenetic study. The phylogenetic relationships of the samples were determined separately for subgroups A and B using neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI). Phylogenetic analysis of the 32 sequenced samples showed that all 9 RSV-A strains were clustered within NA1 genotype while the remaining 23 strains of the RSV-B subgroup could be grouped into a clade consisted of strains with 60-nucleotide duplication region. They were further classified into newly discovered BA10 and BA9 genotypes. The present finding suggests the emergence of RSV genotypes of NA1 and BA.

Traditional vaccines were composed of entire or fractions of the infectious agent. However, challenges remain, and new vaccine technologies are mandatory. In this context, the use of mRNA for immunizing purposes has shown an enhanced performance, as demonstrated by the speedy approval of two mRNA vaccines preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond success in preventing viral infections, mRNA vaccines can also be used for therapeutic cancer applications. Nevertheless, the instability of mRNA and its fast clearance from the body due to the presence of nucleases makes its naked delivery not possible. In this context, nanomedicines, and specifically polymeric nanoparticles, are critical mRNA delivery systems. Thus, the aim of this article is to describe the protocol for the formulation and test of an mRNA vaccine candidate based on the proprietary polymeric nanoparticles. The synthesis and chemical characterization of the poly(beta aminoesters) polymers used, their complexation with mRNA to form nanoparticles, and their lyophilization methodology will be discussed here. This is a crucial step for decreasing storage and distribution costs. Finally, the required tests to demonstrate their capacity to in vitro transfect and mature model dendritic cells will be indicated. This protocol will benefit the scientific community working on vaccination because of its high versatility that enables these vaccines to prevent or cure a wide variety of diseases.","output":"Synthesis and Characterization of mRNA-Loaded Poly(Beta Aminoesters) Nanoparticles for Vaccination Purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prescription of physical activity (PA) in clinical care has been advocated worldwide. This exercise is medicine (E=M) concept can be used to prevent, manage, and cure various lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Due to several challenges, E=M is not yet routinely implemented in clinical care. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the rationale and design of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) study, which aims to facilitate the implementation of E=M in hospital care. METHODS: PIE=M consists of 3 interrelated work packages. First, levels and determinants of PA in different patient and healthy populations will be investigated using existing cohort data. The current implementation status, facilitators, and barriers of E=M will also be investigated using a mixed-methods approach among clinicians of participating departments from 2 diverse university medical centers (both located in a city, but one serving an urban population and one serving a more rural population). Implementation strategies will be connected to these barriers and facilitators using a systematic implementation mapping approach. Second, a generic E=M tool will be developed that will provide tailored PA prescription and referral. Requirements for this tool will be investigated among clinicians and department managers. The tool will be developed using an iterative design process in which all stakeholders reflect on the design of the E=M tool. Third, we will pilot-implement the set of implementation strategies, including the E=M tool, to test its feasibility in routine care of clinicians in these 2 university medical centers. An extensive learning process evaluation will be performed among clinicians, department managers, lifestyle coaches, and patients using a mixed-methods design based on the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: This project was approved and funded by the Dutch grant provider ZonMW in April 2018. The project started in September 2018 and continues until December 2020 (depending on the course of the COVID-19 crisis). All data from the first work package have been collected and analyzed and are expected to be published in 2021. Results of the second work package are described. The manuscript is expected to be published in 2021. The third work package is currently being conducted in clinical practice in 4 departments of 2 university medical hospitals among clinicians, lifestyle coaches, hospital managers, and patients. Results are expected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The PIE=M project addresses the potential of providing patients with PA advice to prevent and manage chronic disease, improve recovery, and enable healthy ageing by developing E=M implementation strategies, including an E=M tool, in routine clinical care. The PIE=M project will result in a blueprint of implementation strategies, including an E=M screening and referral tool, which aims to improve E=M referral by clinicians to improve patients health, while minimizing the burden on clinicians.","output":"Implementing Individually Tailored Prescription of Physical Activity in Routine Clinical Care: Protocol of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) Development and Implementation Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores cycles in innovative outcomes corresponding with the timing of political turnover.

This paper also indicates that local political turnover significantly inhibits firms research and development investment, government subsidies, and expansion decisions, leading to less innovative outcomes.

So, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of education based on (HLI) on the self-care ability among older adults. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted with 68 older adults during the period of May-August 2019. The research setting was health centers in the south of Tehran, Iran. Samples were selected with considering the inclusion criteria. Then Block randomization was used to assign the participants into two groups. The intervention group for 4 weeks in groups of 8-10 in the intervention group. Self-care ability was measured using a self-care questionnaire in two stages, before and two months after the implementation of intervention. The control group received no education and only used the routine community house services. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 16.0). Data were analyzed using the Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and independent t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean total self-care ability scores in the intervention group were 165.38  10.69 and 184.28  10.07 before and after intervention, respectively. These scores in the control group were 163.65  13.27 and 167.52  13.58, respectively (P < 0.001).

Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves 90 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's  = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement ( = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement ( = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.","output":"Clarifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes through postmortem analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders in the context of long-term conditions in children and young people are currently overlooked and undertreated. Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population. The aim of this multi-site randomised controlled trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a modular psychological intervention to usual care for the mental health disorders in comparison to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. METHODS: In total, 334 participants aged 3C18 years attending epilepsy services will be screened for mental health disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the diagnostic Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA). Those identified as having a mental health disorder and consenting to the trial will be randomised to either receive up to 22 sessions of the modular psychological intervention (MATCH-ADTC) delivered over the telephone over 6 months by non-mental health professionals in addition to usual care or to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-randomisation. It is hypothesised that MATCH-ADTC plus usual care will be superior to assessment-enhanced usual care in improving emotional and behavioural symptoms. The primary outcome is the SDQ reported by parents at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include parent-reported mental health measures such as the Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and physical health measures such as the Hague Seizure Severity Scale. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Qualitative process evaluations and a health economic evaluation will also be completed. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to determine whether a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and treatment of mental health disorders in children and young people with epilepsy is clinically and cost-effective. The findings will contribute to policies and practice with regard to addressing mental health needs in children and young people with other long-term conditions.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) with ESA to estimate the effect of different achieved Hb values on physical HRQOL and functionality. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases, until May 2020. Two authors independently extracted data from studies. We included observational and RCTs that enrolled CKD patients undergoing anemia treatment with ESA with different achieved Hb levels among groups. We excluded studies with achieved Hb < 9 g/dL. For the meta-analysis, we included RCTs with control groups achieving Hb 10-11.5 g/dL and active groups with Hb > 11.5 g/dL. We analyzed the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups for physical HRQOL. RESULTS Among 8496 studies, fifteen RCTs and five observational studies were included for the systematic review. We performed the meta-analysis in a subset of eleven eligible RCTs. For physical role and physical function, SMDs were 0.0875 [95% CI: - 0.0025 - 0.178] and 0.08 [95% CI: - 0.03 - 0.19], respectively. For fatigue, SMD was 0.16 [95% CI: 0.09-0.24]. Subgroup analysis showed that trials with greater achieved Hb had greater pooled effects sizes - 0.21 [95% CI: 0.07-0.36] for Hb > 13 g/dL vs. 0.09 [95% CI: 0.02-0.16] for Hb 11.5-13 g/dL. Proportion of older and long-term diabetic patients across studies were associated with lower effect sizes. CONCLUSION Achieved hemoglobin higher than currently recommended targets may be associated with small but potentially clinically significant improvement in fatigue, but not in physical role or physical function. Younger and non-diabetic patients may experience more pronounced benefits of higher Hb levels after treatment with ESAs.","output":"Physical health-related quality of life at higher achieved hemoglobin levels among chronic kidney disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The influence of age on intensive care unit (ICU) decision-making is complex, and it is unclear if it is based on expected subjective or objective patient outcomes. To address recent concerns over age-based ICU decision-making, we explored patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors before the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies published between January 2000 and April 2020, of elderly patients admitted to ICUs. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We extracted data on self-reported QoL (EQ-5D composite score), demographic and clinical variables. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we then compared QoL scores at follow-up to scores either before admission, age-matched population controls or younger ICU survivors. We conducted sensitivity analyses to study heterogeneity and bias and a qualitative synthesis of subscores. RESULTS: We identified 2536 studies and included 22 for qualitative synthesis and 18 for meta-analysis (n=2326 elderly survivors). Elderly survivors QoL was significantly worse than younger ICU survivors, with a small-to-medium effect size (d=0.35 (?0.53 and ?0.16)). Elderly survivors QoL was also significantly greater when measured slightly before ICU, compared with follow-up, with a small effect size (d=0.26 (?0.44 and ?0.08)). Finally, their QoL was also marginally significantly worse than age-matched community controls, also with a small effect size (d=0.21 (?0.43 and 0.00)). Mortality rates and length of follow-up partly explained heterogeneity. Reductions in QoL seemed primarily due to physical health, rather than mental health items. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the proportionality of age as a determinant of ICU resource allocation should be kept under close review and that subjective QoL outcomes should inform person-centred decision -aking in elderly ICU patients.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. SETTING: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). METHODS: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1C10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom). The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. CONCLUSION: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.","output":"Clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a cohort of patients with disability due to spinal cord injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of automation, the Internet of Things (IoT) has come up as a solution and innovation for many applications to improve the basic facilities required in the day-to-day routine. IoT, itself is the interconnectivity of different physical devices with the help of wireless networks e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi without human intervention. The low-cost embedded control unit for Covid free Smart Home is based on the idea of home automation by keeping the current situation of the Covid pandemic in mind. Irradiation of Ultraviolet C (UVC) spectrum is used to sanitize household goods, where convectional sanitization process is not suitable. Simple home automation means controlling or monitoring different electronic/electrical home appliances, devices, and other such things with smartphones or by doing sensor-based operations. All the required devices are connected with one embedded control unit which is managed through a mobile app. This functionality can be accessed either by manually operating a mobile app or with voice assistants e.g., Alexa or Google Assistant, etc. The basic point of communication among devices is based on real-time sensor inputs, which trigger the devices for action and react as per requirements. Ambient light sensors are used to control the on/off the functionality of lights based on the intensity of light present naturally. In this scenario, lights will be switched off in day mode and switched on in night mode. Advancement in wireless technologies enables the researchers to apply various modes of communications among the sensors, gateway, and applications. Bluetooth, Wireless sensor network (WSN), Wi-Fi, Global system for mobile communication (GSM) are a few of them, which are being used either in sensing nodes or in communication gateway to make home automation free of the wired network.","output":"Design of low cost IoT enabled embedded control system for covid free smart home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations and over time during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods: Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries submitted between November 2020 and November 2021 by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the main effects and potential interactions between occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people in shared workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings. Findings: Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75-81%]) and education workers (64% [59%-69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%-40%] and 38% [33%-43%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51% [44%-57%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, levels of workspace sharing and close contact were higher and usage of face coverings at work lower in later phases of the pandemic compared to earlier phases. Interpretation: Major variations in patterns of workplace contact and mask use are likely to contribute to differential COVID-19 risk.

STUDY DESIGN: Survey via Qualtrics. SETTING: Academic pain medicine programs. METHODS: A consortium of program directors converged to discuss methods for determining the effectiveness and future direction of the video format for pain medicine fellowship interviews. Two surveys were formulated, one targeting pain medicine fellowship program directors and the other for candidates interviewing for the year 2021-2022. RESULTS: For applicants, 55 out of 170 responded for a response rate of 32.3%, and for program directors, 38 out of 95 responded for a response rate of 40%. Of the applicants, 45.7% stated that they would prefer video interviews, whereas 27.3% of program directors preferred video interviews. Savings of time and money were the most common reason for preferring video interviews. LIMITATIONS: The number of pain fellowship applicants invited was limited to those who interviewed at a subset of pain fellowships, which may not have been representative of all pain fellow applicants.

Our study aimed to investigate the effect of respiratory exercise on partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation in arterial blood and anxiety assessed by the GAD-7 scale in the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Clinical Center, Kragujevac, from June to July 2020. The study was a prospective clinical trial and included 62 patients with the acute-phase of COVID-19 infection (61.3% males, mean age 60.82  11.72). The duration of the comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program was 14 days  2.28 days. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were determined by using the pulse oximeter, oxygen flow, and arterial blood gas analysis values by using the gas analyzer. The anxiety assessment was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). RESULTS: The values of oxygen saturation significantly differed before and after the respiratory exercise sessions (95.77 vs 98.02, respectively; p < .001). After the respiratory exercise program, significantly lower values of the GAD-7 scale were observed compared to the values before the respiratory exercise program (p = .049). A significant negative correlation was observed between oxygen saturation after respiratory exercise and age and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( = -0.329; p = .013;  = -0.334; p = .009, respectively). GAD-7 score after respiratory exercise negatively correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignancy ( = -0.285; p = .025;  = -0.350; p = .005, respectively).

Instantly detecting COVID-19 is crucial for epidemic prevention. In this study, olfactory dysfunction is a significant symptom in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients but relatively rare in other respiratory viral infections. The Taiwan smell identification test (TWSIT) is a speedy and inexpensive option for accurately distinguishing anosmia that also quantifies the degree of anosmia. Using TWSIT in the outpatient clinic for early identifying the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 can be promising. Methods Nineteen patients confirmed COVID-19 in central Taiwan were collected and divided into two groups: olfactory dysfunction and non-olfactory dysfunction. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and the results of the olfactory test were compared between these two groups. Findings Thirteen (68.4%) of the 19 patients had olfactory dysfunction. The patients with olfactory dysfunction were younger than those without this symptom. The statistical difference in age distribution was significant between these two groups (IQR: 25.5-35.5 vs. IQR: 32.5-60.3; p-value: 0.012). There was no significant difference in gender, smoking history, comorbidities, travel history, respiratory tract infection symptoms, and laboratory findings between these two groups. Conclusion This study demonstrated that young adults were prone to develop olfactory dysfunctions. In the flu season, olfactory dysfunction is considered a specific screening criterion for early detecting COVID-19 in the community.

Although studies have suggested that COVID-19 increased the prevalence of psychological health problems among undergraduates, the associations between the risk of depression and safety practices and the influence of gender on these associations have not been studied in detail. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among preparatory-year undergraduates in a large public university in Saudi Arabia during the outbreak. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, and the practice of eight precautionary behaviors was also assessed. Data analysis was performed using the chi-square test, multiple linear regression and Spearman's correlation coefficient. In total, 3044 undergraduates were surveyed. The mean age was 18.6 years (SD = 0.84), and 61.9% (n = 1883) of the participants were female. Overall, 47.7% of the participants reported having elevated depressive symptoms. Overall mean values of CES-D scores were higher among female undergraduates than that of male undergraduates (18.08 versus 15.56, p < 0.01). There were inverse and weak but significant relationships between the CES-D score and frequent cleaning of hands (male: r = -0.116, p < 0.01; female: r = -0.098, p < 0.01), wearing a mask when going out (male: r = -0.172, p < 0.01; female: r = -0.135, p < 0.01), keeping social distance (male: r = -0.117, p < 0.01; female: r = -0.147, p < 0.01), and covering the nose when sneezing (male: r = -0.202, p < 0.01; female: r = -0.115, p < 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that adherence to precautionary measures was a strong predictor of reduction of depressive symptoms in the target population. Male gender was also found to be an independent predictor of reduction of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in this target group, and female undergraduates seemed to be more vulnerable to developing such symptoms. Results also indicated that female undergraduates were more likely to implement the protective measures for COVID-19. The promotion of precautionary measures seems to be effective in reducing distress in this target population, but further research is needed to confirm our assertions.","output":"Depressive Symptomatology and Practice of Safety Measures among Undergraduate Students during COVID-19: Impact of Gender"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a global health crisis, has resulted in widespread socioeconomic restrictions including lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation. To date, little is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with bipolar disorder as a particularly vulnerable group.MethodsAn online survey was conducted in Austria at two points of measurement (T1 April 2020 during the first lockdown vs. T2 May 2020 at post-lockdown). The sample comprises 20 patients with bipolar disorder (mean age = 49.4  15.6 years) and 20 healthy controls (mean age = 32.7  9.6 years). A 2  2 factorial design to compare two time points (T1 vs. T2) and two groups (patients vs. healthy controls) was used. Main outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and a (non-validated and non-standardized) assessment to determine COVID-19 fears and emotional distress due to social distancing. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the longitudinal association of COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing during lockdown (T1) and psychological symptoms after lockdown (T2).ResultsAt T1, results demonstrated higher scores in BSI-18 subscales depression, anxiety and global severity index as well as emotional distress due to social distancing in bipolar patients compared to controls. There was a significant time x group interaction in the BSI-18 subscale somatization showing a decreasing trend in patients with BD compared to controls. No time effects in BSI-18 subscales or COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing were observed. Regression analyses showed that COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted somatization, only in patients.ConclusionsThere was a connection between the lockdown measures and somatization symptoms observed in patients. When the first steps of easing the social restrictions in May 2020 took place, somatization decreased only in the bipolar compared to the control group. Higher COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted later symptoms at post-lockdown. Long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic need further investigations to improve current therapeutic approaches and prevent fears and distress during lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder in times of crisis.","output":"Psychological symptoms during and after Austrian first lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder?

Developing novel algorithms for automatic analysis of compressed data without decompression is the need of the present hour.

The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 87 years, with a mean age of 47 years, while the ages of the nyaope users ranged from 17 to 55 years, with a mean age of 30 years. Depression scores ranged from 0 to 27 with a mean of 7. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 scores of 5 and above, were reported by 49% of the sample. The levels of depression symptoms ranged from mild to severe, and the severity was higher among female, unemployed, and single participants. As with many others, these participants were not diagnosed and therefore were not treated. The study, therefore, identified that living with nyaope users is associated with the development of different levels of depression symptoms and has resulted in reduced quality of life among family members.

Jakarta, one of the regional governments within the unitary state of Indonesia and a capital city of the state, projected its paradiplomacy in response to the pandemic. Its status as a lower administration below the national government did not prevent it from paying active efforts taking advantage of internet and digital technology development. The paper aims to describe Jakarta governments paradiplomatic practice in responding to the COVID-19. The study applies the qualitative method with a descriptive analysis. In order to describe the regional governments paradiplomacy, the study utilizes the concept of paradiplomacy and digital diplomacy. The findings show that Jakarta government carried out digital diplomacy as the form of its paradiplomacy in a number of activities such as providing reliable information, collaborating with foreign communities, participating in global forum, releasing gubernatorial message, improving data platform capability, and initiating an international forum at home. Such internet-supported activities were meant to share experience, collaborate, and provide transparency. Paradiplomacy through digital diplomacy activities was mainly conducted to gain trust to the regional government from its international audiences and create an image that Jakarta was a crisis-proof city and the part of global community. The paper argues that sub-national governments roles in international affairs are becoming important thanks to a new room for diplomacy practices, strengthened by unprecedented global crises.","output":"Paradiplomacy of Indonesian sub-state actor: Digital diplomacy of Jakarta government in response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing danger of the global economic crisis, the world economy has actually failed to ensure the global food security The number of the world's inhabitants at risk has increased by tens of millions after the pandemic The task of each country is to make every effort to eliminate the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure maximum food security for its citizens Israel has recently made significant achievements in the field of innovative agriculture, so it offers to implement its effective techniques on a wide scale Cooperation between Israel and Russia, as well as mutual assistance in food production can make a significant contribution to the solving strategies of the global food problem  ݧӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ Covid-19  ݧ֧էӧѧӧ֧ ѧߧ ԧݧҧѧݧߧԧ ܧߧާڧ֧ܧԧ ܧڧ٧ڧ ާڧ ܧѧ٧ѧݧ ߧ ԧ  ӧݧߧ֧ߧڧ ٧ѧէѧ, ӧ٧ѧߧߧ  ҧ֧֧֧ߧڧ֧ էӧݧӧ֧ߧߧ ҧ֧٧ѧߧ ݧѧߧ֧ ڧݧ اڧ֧ݧ֧ ݧѧߧ֧, ߧѧէڧ  ٧ߧ ڧܧ, ݧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ӧ֧ݧڧڧݧ ߧ է֧ܧ ާڧݧݧڧߧ ѧէѧ ܧѧاէԧ ԧէѧӧ ٧ѧܧݧѧ֧  , ҧ ڧݧاڧ ާѧܧڧާ ڧݧڧ էݧ ݧڧܧӧڧէѧڧ ݧ֧էӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ Covid-19  ާѧܧڧާѧݧߧ ҧ֧֧ڧ էӧݧӧ֧ߧߧ ҧ֧٧ѧߧ էݧ ӧڧ ԧѧاէѧ էѧӧ ٧ѧڧݧ ҧݧѧէѧ֧ ֧֧٧ߧާ էڧا֧ߧڧާ  ҧݧѧ ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ ڧߧߧӧѧڧߧߧԧ ֧ݧܧԧ ٧ۧӧ  ֧էݧѧԧѧ֧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ ڧ֧ާ էߧڧ֧ӧ ާ֧اէ ٧ѧڧݧ֧  ڧ֧, ӧ٧ѧڧާߧ է֧ۧӧڧ  ӧѧ ڧ٧ӧէӧ էܧ ڧѧߧڧ ާԧ ӧߧ֧  ֧֧ߧڧ ާڧӧ էӧݧӧ֧ߧߧ ҧݧ֧ާ ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ӧܧݧѧ","output":"World Food Security in Covid-19 Conditions - Prospects for Cooperation of Israel and Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"William Pickles was plattelandsdokter in het Britse Wensleydale en een van de grondleggers van epidemiologisch onderzoek in de huisartsenpraktijk.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable due to their role in the management of COVID-19 infected patients. As of June 2020, a total of 847 HCWs in Oman had reportedly contracted COVID-19, with an incidence rate of 1.47%. This study therefore aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Muscat Governorate, Oman, as well as to evaluate adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection among HCWs working under the Directorate General of Health Services of Muscat Governorate, Ministry of Health, between February and June 2020. Data regarding the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, pre-existing medical conditions, and adherence to IPC measures were collected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via a web-based mobile application. RESULTS: A total of 126 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in the study. Of these, 72.2% were female, 53.2% worked in primary care facilities, and 61.1% were medical doctors or nurses. Only 18.1% were over 45 years of age and 30.2% had pre-existing medical conditions. While 29.4% had never received IPC training, the majority followed recommended hand hygiene practice (96.8%) and social distancing protocols (93.7%) and wore protective facemasks for routine patient care (96.9%). CONCLUSION: While the majority of HCWs followed crucial IPC measures, one-third had never received specific IPC training or faced restrictions on PPE use. HCWs, including those in housekeeping and administrative functions are recommended to undergo rigorous IPC training. In addition, high-risk HCWs could be assigned duties away from active COVID 19 cases.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether GWLs can affect US smokers perceptions about their cigarettes or health consequences and changes in smoking behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a randomized clinical trial of the effect of a 3-month, real-world experience of cigarettes with GWL packaging. Community recruitment was done from September 2016 through December 2019 of daily smokers from San Diego, California, aged 21 to 65 years, who were not ready to quit. Participants were randomized to purchase and receive cigarettes in 1 of 3 pack designs: GWL, blank, or standard US pack. Data analysis was performed from July 2020 to February 2021. INTERVENTIONS: The study manufactured GWL cigarette packs (3 versions with Australian-licensed images) and packs devoid of marketing. For 3 months, participants purchased GWL, blank, or standard US pack cigarettes that were delivered to their home. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking-related cognitions and behavior were queried by daily and weekly interactive text messages. Smoking behavior was self-reported before and after the intervention by 96% of randomized participants and was biochemically validated on a subsample. RESULTS: The study sample included 357 participants (195 women [54.6%]; mean [SD] age, 39.5 [11.9] years); 116 were randomized to the standard US pack group, 118 were randomized to the GWL pack group, and 125 were randomized to the blank pack group. Over the 3 months, participants who received the GWL packs had reduced positive perceptions of recent cigarettes smoked compared with participants who received the branded US pack (mean difference, ?0.46 SD; 95% CI, ?0.73 SD to ?0.20 SD; P < .001). Health concerns increased in all groups, with a significant increase in the GWL group vs the US pack group (mean difference, 0.35 SD; 95% CI, 0.09 SD to 0.62 SD; P = .002). Quitting cognitions increased in all study groups, with a peak mean change of 0.60 SD for GWL participants vs 0.34 SD for US pack participants (mean difference, 0.55 SD; 95% CI, 0.28 SD to 0.81 SD; P < .001). GWL participants had slightly more cigarette abstinence periods per week than the US pack group, but the difference was not significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.13). At 3 months, there was no between-group difference in any smoking behavior. The blank pack group was similar to the US pack group on all measures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the introduction of GWL packs appears to decrease positive perceptions of cigarettes and increase quitting cognitions in the short term. However, additional complementary tobacco control strategies may be necessary for GWL packs to be associated with reduced smoking behavior.

While BRFs have been reviewed regarding general ROI risk, no systematic review has addressed BRFs for specific ROIs using a standardized methodology. OBJECTIVE: To identify and evaluate the evidence for the most relevant BRFs for ROIs determined during running and to suggest future research directions. DESIGN: Systematic review considering prospective and retrospective studies. (PROSPERO_ID: 236,832). DATA SOURCES: PubMed. Connected Papers. The search was performed in February 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: English language. Studies on participants whose primary sport is running addressing the risk for the seven most common ROIs and at least one kinematic, kinetic (including pressure measurements), or electromyographic BRF. A BRF needed to be identified in at least one prospective or two independent retrospective studies. BRFs needed to be determined during running. RESULTS: Sixty-six articles fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Levels of evidence for specific ROIs ranged from conflicting to moderate evidence. Running populations and methods applied varied considerably between studies. While some BRFs appeared for several ROIs, most BRFs were specific for a particular ROI. Most BRFs derived from lower-extremity joint kinematics and kinetics were located in the frontal and transverse planes of motion. Further, plantar pressure, vertical ground reaction force loading rate and free moment-related parameters were identified as kinetic BRFs. CONCLUSION: This study offers a comprehensive overview of BRFs for the most common ROIs, which might serve as a starting point to develop ROI-specific risk profiles of individual runners. We identified limited evidence for most ROI-specific risk factors, highlighting the need for performing further high-quality studies in the future.

The diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the ICU, where clinical symptoms as well as imaging are mostly nonspecific. Recently, Aspergillus lateral flow tests were developed to decrease the time to diagnosis of IPA. Several studies have shown promising results in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from hematology patients. We therefore evaluated a new lateral flow test for IPA in ICU patients. METHODS: Using left-over BALf from adult ICU patients in two university hospitals, we studied the performance of the Aspergillus galactomannan lateral flow assay (LFA) by IMMY (Norman, OK, USA). Patients were classified according to the 2008 EORTC-MSG definitions, the AspICU criteria, and the modified AspICU criteria, which incorporate galactomannan results. These internationally recognized consensus definitions for the diagnosis of IPA incorporate patient characteristics, microbiology and radiology. The LFA was read out visually and with a digital reader by researchers blinded to the final clinical diagnosis and IPA classification. RESULTS: We included 178 patients, of which 55 were classified as cases (6 cases of proven and 26 cases of probable IPA according to the EORTC-MSG definitions, and an additional 23 cases according to the modified AspICU criteria). Depending on the definitions used, the sensitivity of the LFA was 0.88-0.94, the specificity was 0.81, and the area under the ROC curve 0.90-0.94, indicating good overall test performance.

Our group previously showed the importance of DDC in viral infections. We hereby aimed to investigate DDC expression in COVID-19 patients and cultured SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, also in association with ACE2 and dACE2. We concurrently evaluated the expression of the viral infection- and interferon-stimulated gene ISG56 and the immune-modulatory, hypoxia-regulated gene EPO. Viral load and mRNA levels of DDC, ACE2, dACE2, ISG56 and EPO were quantified by RT-qPCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients, showing no or mild symptoms, and from non-infected individuals. Samples from influenza-infected patients were analyzed in comparison. SARS-CoV-2-mediated effects in host gene expression were validated in cultured virus-permissive epithelial cells. We found substantially higher gene expression of DDC in COVID-19 patients (7.6-fold; p = 1.2e-13) but not in influenza-infected ones, compared to non-infected subjects. dACE2 was more elevated (2.9-fold; p = 1.02e-16) than ACE2 (1.7-fold; p = 0.0005) in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. ISG56 (2.5-fold; p = 3.01e-6) and EPO (2.6-fold; p = 2.1e-13) were also increased. Detected differences were not attributed to enrichment of specific cell populations in nasopharyngeal tissue. While SARS-CoV-2 virus load was positively associated with ACE2 expression (r0.8, p<0.001), it negatively correlated with DDC, dACE2 (r?0.7, p<0.001) and EPO (r?0.5, p<0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant correlation between DDC and dACE2 expression was observed in nasopharyngeal swab and whole blood samples of both COVID-19 and non-infected individuals (r0.7). In VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 negatively affected DDC, ACE2, dACE2 and EPO mRNA levels, and induced cell death, while ISG56 was enhanced at early hours post-infection. Thus, the regulation of DDC, dACE2 and EPO expression in the SARS-CoV-2-infected nasopharyngeal tissue is possibly related with an orchestrated antiviral response of the infected host as the virus suppresses these genes to favor its propagation.","output":"Alteration of L-Dopa decarboxylase expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection and its association with the interferon-inducible ACE2 isoform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a recently rising infection that causes a high death rate in contaminated individuals.

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) were collected by the research team at day 7 and capillary blood samples at day 42. Household secondary attack rate (SAR) and per-person SAR were calculated based on at least one positive saliva, NPS, OPS, or serum sample. Whole genome sequencing was performed to investigate the possibility of multiple independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions within a household. RESULTS: Eighty-five households were included consisting of 326 (unvaccinated) individuals. Comparable numbers of secondary cases were identified by saliva (133/241; 55.2%) and serum (127/213; 59.6%). The household SAR was 88.2%. The per-person SAR was 64.3%. The majority of the secondary cases tested positive in saliva at day 1 (103/150; 68.7%). Transmission from index case to household member was not affected by age or the nature of their relationship. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a single introduction for the investigated households. CONCLUSION: Households have a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. By repeated saliva self-sampling combined with NPS, OPS, and serology, we found the highest SARS-CoV-2 household transmission rates reported to date.

However, once again, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from participating in clinical trials during this pandemic. This protection by exclusion of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented. Moreover, it is both misguided and not justifiable and may have excluded them from potentially beneficial interventions. This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women. Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.","output":"Protection by Exclusion: Another Missed Opportunity to Include Pregnant Women in Research During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We would like to comment on the recently published article titled: \\"Circulating Vitamin D levels status and clinical prognostic indices in COVID-19 patients\\" by Ricci et al. The authors grouped the patients into two groups according to the vitamin D levels measured at the time of admission into the hospital and reported that lower vitamin D levels are associated with elevated D-dimer and IL-6 levels, low CD4/CD8 ratio and compromised clinical findings with elevated LIPI and SOFA scores. However, review of recent literature shows this association to be debatable. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the initial phase of critical illness have been reported to drop rapidly and hence consideration of the time of measurement from symptom onset would have enhanced the clinical relevance of these findings. Inferred association between vitamin D levels and disease severity based on SOFA score in COVID-19 patients, needs to be further explored in the light of the recent literature which casts doubt on using SOFA score at admission to predict mortality in COVID-19.","output":"Letter to the editor: Vitamin D levels in acute illness and clinical severity in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, which has subsequently led to a global pandemic. At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. Study Design Data from the National Health Commission of China is used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. Methods A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fang Cang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out prior to sealing off the city have also been identified and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu migration index. Results The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre due to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. Conclusions The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.","output":"Modelling the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: Experience and suggestions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patient decision aids should help people make evidence-informed decisions aligned with their values. There is limited guidance about how to achieve such alignment. Purpose: To describe the range of values clarification methods available to patient decision aid developers, synthesize evidence regarding their relative merits, and foster collection of evidence by offering researchers a proposed set of outcomes to report when evaluating the effects of values clarification methods. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Study Selection: We included articles that described randomized trials of one or more explicit values clarification methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation. Data Synthesis: Compared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-disgruent choices (risk difference -0.04 95% CI [-0.06 to -0.02], p<.001) and decisional regret (standardized mean difference -0.20 95% CI [-0.29 to -0.11], p<0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (Chi-squared(2)=9.25, p=.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (Chi-squared(2)=6.08, p=.05). Limitations: Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We grouped values clarification methods into broad categories. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, and decisional regret.","output":"Clarifying Values: An Updated and Expanded Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Currently, there is an increasing interest regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the thyroid function. As several recent reports have described the onset of thyroid dysfunction in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we performed a systematic review to assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 as this information could be clinically relevant for the management of these patients. Methods: A comprehensive computer literature search using PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases was performed until November 14, 2020 to search original articles evaluating thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Information about thyroid dysfunction assessed by thyroid function test was retrieved by the eligible articles. Qualitative analysis (systematic review) only was performed whether a significant heterogeneity of data was detected. Results: Seven studies including 1237 patients with COVID-19 were included. A significant heterogeneity across the studies was found. Most COVID-19 patients were euthyroid with TSH levels in the normal range (from 44 to 94% of the COVID-19 patients assessed in the included studies). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients (defined as abnormal thyroid function tests) largely varies among the included studies between 13 and 64% of COVID-19 patients as well as clinical presentation. A positive correlation between thyroid dysfunction and clinical severity of COVID-19 was reported. Conclusion: Literature data show that thyroid dysfunction is present in a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19. Assessment of thyroid function may be considered in symptomatic COVID-19 patients to have a baseline before introducing thyroid-interfering drugs and those requiring high-intensity care. Further, well-designed studies are needed to better elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on thyroid function and inform thyroid function testing and thyroid dysfunction management in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: By law, covid-19 disease and deaths in workers may lead to coroners' inquests and/or Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigations AIMS: This study assesses the adequacy of these statutory means to yield recommendations for prevention of acquiring covid-19 infection from work METHODS: Covid-19 guidance from the chief coroner and the HSE was appraised, including using Office for National Statistics (ONS) data Practitioners were asked to estimate the likelihood that covid-19 disease may have arisen from 'near-miss' scenarios Data from the judiciary and the HSE were analysed RESULTS: The coroners' guidance allowed a wider range of reports of death than did the HSE and conformed better with ONS data on covid-19 mortality by occupation In the practitioner survey, 62 respondents considered a higher likelihood that reported covid-19 cases would have arisen from the scenario deemed unreportable as a 'dangerous occurrence' by HSE than the reportable scenario (P &lt; 0 001) On average there was only one coroner's report to prevent future death from occupational disease every year in England and Wales The HSE dealt with a yearly average of 1611 reports of work-related disease including 104 on biological agents, but has received about 9000 covid-19 reports CONCLUSIONS: Current HSE guidance for reporting work-related covid-19 may miss many thousands of cases and needs further iteration Coroners have very limited experience of inquiry into occupational disease caused by biological agents compared with the HSE Concerns regarding national policy such as on protective equipment warrant a full public inquiry","output":"Covid-19: statutory means of scrutinizing workers' deaths and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elimination of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) requires highly specific and sensitive tools for both diagnostic at point of care and epidemiological surveys.

In this paper, we evaluate the fairness of models generated on two healthcare datasets for gender and race biases. We generate synthetic versions of the dataset using a Generative Adversarial Network called HealthGAN, and compare the real and synthetic model's balanced accuracy and fairness scores.

This chemokine is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, suggesting a role in lung defenses. However, little is known about the participation of CXCL17 against relevant respiratory pathogens in humans. Here, we evaluated the serum levels and lung tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in a cohort of patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from Mexico City. Peripheral blood samples obtained on admission and seven days after hospitalization were processed for determinations of serum CXCL17 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL17 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHQ) in lung autopsy specimens from patients that succumbed to the disease. Serum CXCL17 levels were also analyzed in two additional comparative cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients. Additionally, the expression of CXCL17 was tested in lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 68 had pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 24 had COVID-19, and 30 with PTB. CXCL17 was detected in post-mortem lung specimens from patients that died of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and COVID-19. Interestingly, serum levels of CXCL17 were increased only in patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB. CXCL17 not only differentiated pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from other respiratory infections but showed prognostic value for influenza-associated mortality and renal failure in machine-learning algorithms and regression analyses. Using cell culture assays, we also identified that human alveolar A549 cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages increase their CXCL17 production capacity after influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection. Our results for the first time demonstrate an induction of CXCL17 specifically during pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB in humans. These findings could be of great utility to differentiate influenza and COVID-19 and to predict poor prognosis specially at settings of high incidence of pandemic A(H1N1).

The challenge of anesthesia is to maintain a calm, comfortable, and cooperative patient during the mapping phase. Response surface models (RSMs) are multidrug modeling algorithms. In this pharmacodynamic study, we investigate the first use of RSM with bispectral index (BIS) to predict patient's response to name calling (RNC) and wakefulness (complete neurological tests) during AC. METHODS The study is performed in two phases. We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) using propofol and fentanyl as the modeling group. Effect-site concentrations (Ce) and BIS values were recorded and a RSM is built from the data set. We verified the RSM retrospectively in AC patients, designated as the validation group. Corresponding BIS values were analyzed for RNC and wakefulness. RESULTS A total of 155 data sets of propofol Ce, fentanyl Ce, and BIS pairs were available for modeling. The range of propofol and fentanyl Ce were 0 to 9.95 g/mL and 0 to 3.69 ng/mL, respectively. Observed BIS ranged from 21 to 98. The model identified an additive interaction between propofol and an opioid. RNC at BIS 64 is predicted by the model and 70 is required for wakefulness. CONCLUSION RSM built from VATS patients is verified with a separate group of AC patient. The BIS target advised for RSM-predicted wakefulness is 70. The model illustrates the timeline to wakefulness during AC under propofol and an opioid. It has implications in guiding, dosing, and estimation of time to wakefulness with propofol and an opioid.","output":"Opioid and propofol pharmacodynamics modeling during brain mapping in awake craniotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Royal Army Dental Corps (RADC) provides dental care to the British Army both in barracks and on deployment While a significant proportion of most RADC dental officers' careers is spent working in permanent military primary care dental clinics, it is the ability of all RADC dental officers to provide dental care when deployed that provides unique challenges only seen in the military environment.

There was no difference in students' level of anxiety about the pandemic after course participation (3.0 vs. 3.1, p = 0.53). Twelve students (44.4%) completed the institutional evaluation. All rated the course \\"very good\\" or \\"excellent.\\" Students favorably reviewed the field placements, suggested readings, self-directed research, and learning from peers. They suggested more clearly defined expectations and improved balance between volunteer and educational hours. CONCLUSIONS: The elective was well-received by students, achieved stated objectives, and garnered public attention. Course leadership should monitor students' time commitment closely in service-learning settings to ensure appropriate balance of service and education. Student engagement in a disaster response is insufficient to address anxiety related to the disaster; future course iterations should include a focus on self-care during times of crisis. This educational innovation could serve as a model for medical schools globally.","output":"Global health on the front lines: an innovative medical student elective combining education and service during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Modifiable lifestyle factors and severe COVID-19 risk: a Mendelian randomisation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), the virus responsible for the current devastating worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter\\\\regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2 Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID\\\\19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co\\\\morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2\\\\expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID\\\\19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID\\\\19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID\\\\19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence\\\\based treatment strategies Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID\\\\19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID\\\\19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID\\\\19 severity In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID\\\\19 ? 2020 The Authors The Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland","output":"Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgical wait list time is a major problem in many health-care systems and its influence on survival is unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of wait list time on long-term disease-free survival in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery at a tertiary care center. Wait list time was defined as the time from completion of diagnostic workup to definitive surgery and divided into 2-week intervals from 0 to 6 weeks. The outcome variables were 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients, 364 (60.5%) male, median age 73 years (range = 71) were defined. The median wait list time was 28 days (range = 99). Two and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 521 (86.5%) and 500 (83.1%) respectively. There were no differences in 2-year or 5-year disease-free survival for the whole cohort or by tumor stage between wait list time intervals except for AJCC stage II tumors which showed a higher 5-year disease-free survival for the 2C4 and 4C6-week wait list time interval (p = 0.021).

The availability of prophylactic vaccines for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represents an important advancement in the prevention of cervical cancer. In Jordan, the availability of the HPV vaccination is restricted to individuals who are willing to pay. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the willingness and attitude of female university students in health schools/faculties in Jordan to get HPV vaccination and their knowledge about the virus. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed in October 2021, which comprised 27 items to evaluate HPV knowledge, history of HPV vaccination, intentions to get the HPV vaccine, and the reason(s) behind vaccine refusal for those who rejected vaccination. The study sample comprised 836 participants: medical students (39.7%), pharmacy students (26.0%), dental students (21.2%), and nursing students (13.2%). Only 524 participants had heard of HPV prior to the study (62.7%), of which 48.7% knew about the availability of HPV vaccines. The lowest level of HPV knowledge was observed among nursing students. Only 19/524 students reported a history of HPV vaccination (3.6%). The overall willingness to receive HPV vaccination if provided freely was 75.0%, while only 16.0% were willing to pay for the vaccine. The most common reason for HPV vaccine rejection was the perceived low risk to get HPV infection. Significantly higher intentions to get HPV vaccination were found among older participants and medical students. The embrace of vaccine conspiracy beliefs was associated with a significantly less willingness to get the HPV vaccination (p < 0.001). Dependence on the internet/social media as the source of HPV knowledge was associated with a significantly lower intention to get HPV vaccination (p = 0.002). The coverage of the HPV vaccination among female university students in health schools in Jordan appeared extremely low; however, three-fourths of the students who had heard of HPV were willing to receive the HPV vaccination if provided freely. Complacency appeared as a major factor for HPV vaccine rejection. Increasing the levels of knowledge and awareness of HPV infection and its association with cervical cancer through reliable sources is recommended. This can be helpful for the individual benefit of the students besides the potentially positive role they can play in community education. Countering vaccine conspiracy beliefs with proper education and awareness programs can be helpful to appraise the role of HPV vaccines in cancer prevention.","output":"Attitude towards HPV Vaccination and the Intention to Get Vaccinated among Female University Students in Health Schools in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased dramatically in children and adolescents, posing a real public health problem. Beyond unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles, growing evidence suggests that some perinatal factors, such as low birth weight (LBW), are associated with higher risk of T2D in adulthood. In this regard, it remains unclear whether the increased risk is already present in childhood and adolescence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association of LBW or being small for gestational age (SGA) with insulin resistance in childhood and adolescence. The systematic review resulted in 28 individual studies, and those with the same outcome were included within two random-effects meta-analyses. Compared with children or adolescents born with adequate size for gestational age, those SGA had 2.33-fold higher risk of T2D (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-5.17). Furthermore, LBW and being SGA were associated with 0.20 higher mean homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values (95% CI: 0.02-0.38). Given the high prevalence of preterm babies, from a population perspective, these results may be of great importance as they point to the existence of a potentially vulnerable subgroup of children and adolescents that could benefit from screening tests and early preventive strategies.","output":"Low birth weight and small for gestational age are associated with complications of childhood and adolescence obesity: Systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS Although transanal endoscopic surgery is practiced worldwide, there is no consensus on comparative outcomes between transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) and transanal excision (TAE). In this study, we reviewed our experiences with these techniques and compared patients who underwent TEO and TAE using propensity score matching (PSM). METHODS A total of 207 patients underwent local rectal tumor excision between January 2008 and November 2015. To overcome selection bias, we used PSM to achieve a one-to-one TEO: TAE ratio. We included baseline characteristics, age, sex, surgeon, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location (clockwise direction), involved circumference quadrants, tumor size, and pathology. RESULTS After PSM, 72 patients were included in each group. The tumor distance from the anal verge was higher in the TEO group (8.0 [5-10] vs. TAE: 4.0 [3-5], p < 0.001). Complication rates did not differ between the groups (TEO: 8.3% vs. TAE: 11.1%, p = 0.39). TEO was associated with a shorter hospital stay (3.01 vs. 4.68 days, p = 0.001), higher negative margin rate (95.8 vs. 86.1%, p = 0.039), and non-fragmented specimen rate vs. TAE (98.6 vs. 90.3%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS TEO was more beneficial for patients with higher rectal tumors. Regardless of tumor location, involved circumference quadrants, and tumor size, TEO may more effectively achieve negative resection margins and non-fragmented specimens. Consequently, although local excision method according to tumor distance may be important, TEO will become the standard for rectal tumors.","output":"Transanal Endoscopic Operation Versus Conventional Transanal Excision for Rectal Tumors: Case-Matched Study with Propensity Score Matching."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several animal species, including ferrets, hamsters, monkeys, and raccoon dogs, have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection by the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which were responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, respectively. Emerging studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 natural infection of pet dogs and cats is also possible, but its prevalence is not fully understood. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently in cats than in dogs and that cats can transmit the virus through aerosols. With approximately 470 million pet dogs and 370 million pet cats cohabitating with their human owners worldwide, the finding of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in these household pets has important implications for potential zoonotic transmission events during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future SARS-related outbreaks.

A tailored therapeutic approach, based on sensitive and specific biomarkers, could allow a more accurate analysis of disease susceptibility/prognostic and of the response to treatment. OBJECTIVES This mini-review and pilot study had two main goals: (1) reviewing the most recent literature encompassing the use of interleukins as inflammatory markers influenced by the redox imbalances in T2DM and (2) assessing parameters that conjunctly evaluate the redox impairment and inflammatory burden of T2DM patients, taking into consideration smoking status, as such group-specific biomarkers are scarcely reported in literature. METHODS Firstly, PubMed database was surveyed to select and review the relevant studies employing interleukins as T2DM biomarkers and to assess if studies using combined inflammatory-redox indices were reported. Then, routine biochemical parameters were assessed in a pilot study -T2DM patients with 3 subgroups: non-smokers, smokers and ex-smokers, were compared to a control group of non-diabetic, apparently healthy non-smokers. Protein (AOPPs, AGEs), lipid/HDL (Amplex Red-based method) oxidative damage and inflammatory status (CRP, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10) biomarkers were assessed. Cytokine ratios and 2 oxidative-inflammatory status indices were developed (IH1 and IH2) and evaluated. RESULTS We observed significant differences in terms of serum redox and inflammatory status (AOPPs, AGEs, CRP, CRP/HDL, CRP/IL-6, IL-10/IL-6, IH1) between T2DM patients compared to control and, moreover, between the subgroups formed considering smoking status (CRP, CRP/HDL, IH1). Glycemic control strongly influenced inflammatory status biomarkers: glycemia was positively correlated with the inflammatory parameters (CRP/IL-10) and inversely with the anti-inflammatory ones (IL-10, IL-10/IL-1 ratio). CONCLUSIONS Several of the assessed parameters may possess prognostic value for diabetics, especially when comparing subgroups with a different smoking history and could prove useful in clinical practice for assessing disease progress and therapeutic efficacy.","output":"Interleukins and redox impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus: mini-review and pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has turned out to be a global health emergency, affecting millions of people worldwide.

Using knowledge synthesis methods such as systematic scoping study methods may facilitate knowledge tool development and guide evidence-based practice to improve knowledge transfer. However, identifying these opportunities poses a challenge as systematic scoping study methods have yet to be applied and adapted to this context. Thus, to extend systematic scoping study methods, the purpose of the current investigation is to describe the adaptation of systematic scoping study methods in the context of cancer-specific real world opportunities in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Systematic scoping study methods were adapted to develop a knowledge tool, which was a credible resource website for researchers, clinicians, and survivors. Three search strategies including Advanced Google Search, targeted website search, and consultations with experts were used to identify eligible (e.g., appropriate for cancer survivors, offered in the community) cancer-specific physical activity programs. Only the targeted website search was used to search post-secondary institutions because they are centralized onto one government website. RESULTS: Fifty-eight programs and 10 post-secondary courses met the eligibility criteria. Relevant data from these opportunities were extracted, charted, synthesized, and uploaded onto the resource website. The most successful search strategy for cancer-specific physical activity programs was the targeted website search followed by Google Advanced Search and consultations with content experts. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges were experienced due to lack of standard reporting among opportunities, bias of potentially relevant records, and changing nature of resulting records. The current investigation demonstrated that systematic scoping study methods can be applied to cancer-specific physical activity programs and post-secondary courses in the context of cancer survivorship in Ontario yielding robust results.

Metallo--lactamases (MBLs) represent the largest family of carbapenemases. Regrettably, these resistance determinants are spreading worldwide. Among them, the New Delhi metallo--lactamase (NDM-1) is experiencing the fastest and largest geographical spread. NDM-1 -lactamase is anchored to the bacterial outer membrane, while most MBLs are soluble, periplasmic enzymes. This unique cellular localization favors the selective secretion of active NDM-1 into outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Here, we advance the idea that NDM-containing vesicles serve as vehicles for the local dissemination of NDM-1. We show that OMVs with NDM-1 can protect a carbapenem-susceptible strain of Escherichia coli upon treatment with meropenem in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Survival curves of G. mellonella revealed that vesicle encapsulation enhances the action of NDM-1, prolonging and favoring bacterial protection against meropenem inside the larva hemolymph. We also demonstrate that E. coli cells expressing NDM-1 protect a susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain within the larvae in the presence of meropenem. By using E. coli variants engineered to secrete variable amounts of NDM-1, we demonstrate that the protective effect correlates with the amount of NDM-1 secreted into vesicles. We conclude that secretion of NDM-1 into OMVs contributes to the survival of otherwise susceptible nearby bacteria at infection sites. These results disclose that OMVs play a role in the establishment of bacterial communities, in addition to traditional horizontal gene transfer mechanisms.","output":"On the Offensive: the Role of Outer Membrane Vesicles in the Successful Dissemination of New Delhi Metallo--lactamase (NDM-1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans.

METHOD: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS: The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark. In spite the abundant regulations in place, market control instruments have detected counterfeit face masks, which means that public authorities and users should ask manufacturers or suppliers for additional information in case of doubt.

We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default.","output":"Does macroprudential policy alleviate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the resilience of banks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the announcement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, government officials in Hong Kong recommended the wearing of face masks as a public infection control measure against the COVID-19 virus and curtail the impact of the concurrent influenza season.

Additionally, SOT recipients are compared with general patients with first-wave COVID-19. RESULTS: Organs transplanted included 38 kidneys, 8 livers, 5 hearts, and 3 pancreases. Average SOT recipient age was 57.4 years; 62% were male; 46.6% were African American 36.2% were white. Comorbidities included hypertension (86%), chronic kidney disease (86%), diabetes mellitus (50%), coronary artery disease (26%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14%). Twenty patients had severe COVID-19 (34.5%) and 38 had nonsevere disease (65.5%). Severe disease was more common in older SOT recipients with comorbidities and was associated with cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, C-reactive protein >10 mg/L, and platelet count <150/L. Sex, race, body mass index, time from transplant, baseline immunosuppression, and diagnosis month did not differ among those with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Seventy percent of SOT recipients were hospitalized vs 27.2% of general patients with COVID-19 and inpatient SOT recipients had a higher mechanical ventilation rate. Though a trend toward longer length of stay, higher intensive care unit admission, and greater inpatient mortality was observed (19.5% vs 14.8%), these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has greatly impacted SOT recipients. One-third of our SOT recipients seen during the first wave had severe illness with associated standard risk factors for poor outcome. Compared with general first-wave patients, more SOT recipients were hospitalized, although inpatient COVID-19 mortality did not significantly differ.","output":"COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplantation: Disease Severity and Clinical Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and morbidity worldwide. Many studies have shown machine learning models to be effective in detecting lung nodules from chest X-ray images. However, these techniques have yet to be embraced by the medical community due to several practical, ethical, and regulatory constraints stemming from the black-box nature of deep learning models. Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-rays are benign; therefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection cannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns, this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based computer vision model, which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as interpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is trained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers associated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker scores for chest X-ray images from two independent data sets, for which malignancy metadata is available. Next, multi-variate predictive models were mined by fitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and interrogating a range of metrics to determine the best model. The best decision tree model achieved sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this method may be considered as a starting point for refinement into clinically useful multi-variate lung cancer malignancy models for implementation as a workflow augmentation tool to improve the efficiency of human radiologists.","output":"Deep Mining Generation of Lung Cancer Malignancy Models from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many acute respiratory illness surveillance systems collect and test nasopharyngeal (NP) and/or oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimens, yet there are few studies assessing the relative measures of performance for NP versus OP specimens. METHODS: We collected paired NP and OP swabs separately from pediatric and adult patients with influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness at two respiratory surveillance sites in Kenya. The specimens were tested for eight respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Positivity for a specific virus was defined as detection of viral nucleic acid in either swab. RESULTS: Of 2,331 paired NP/OP specimens, 1,402 (60.1%) were positive for at least one virus, and 393 (16.9%) were positive for more than one virus. Overall, OP swabs were significantly more sensitive than NP swabs for adenovirus (72.4% vs. 57.6%, p<0.01) and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (91.2% vs. 70.4%, p<0.01). NP specimens were more sensitive for influenza B virus (83.3% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.02), parainfluenza virus 2 (85.7%, vs. 39.3%, p<0.01), and parainfluenza virus 3 (83.9% vs. 67.4%, p<0.01). The two methods did not differ significantly for human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H3N2) virus, parainfluenza virus 1, or respiratory syncytial virus.

Accurate tailoring relies on the availability of high-quality Indigenous-specific data. The potential benefits of increased availability of Indigenous data need to be balanced by efforts to ensure those data are collected and used appropriately. This paper identifies characteristics of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) principles and considers a framework for operationalisation. METHODS: A PRISMA compliant search of the literature was undertaken, using methods detailed in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook on Systematic Reviews of Health Promotion and Public Health Interventions (1). The search strategy comprised two steps: a search of 11 scientific electronic databases and five grey literature sources. The search was limited by date of publication (1 January 2000 to 1 December 2021). The following keywords and subject heading terms were used: (exp Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or Aborigin* or Torres Strait Island* or, Oceanic ancestry group) and (exp research or biomedical research or population surveillance or translational medical research or, research design) and (exp data or datasets or data collection or data management or health surveys or information dissemination or, intellectual property) and (exp self-determination or ownership or control or access or possession or OCAP or sovereignty or, ethics) and, (exp Australia). IDS principles: (i) ownership; (ii) control; (iii) accessibility; (iv) custodianship; (v) accountability to Indigenous people; (vi) amplify Community voice; (vii) relevant and reciprocal; and (viii) sustainably self-determining. Using standard data extraction forms, we examined relevant Australian studies to identify key characteristics and frequency with which they cited IDS principles. These findings were consolidated into an operationalisation framework. FINDINGS: 34 relevant Australian published studies were identified. The most frequently cited IDS principles were Accountability to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and sustainably self-determining. The least frequently cited principle was Access. A framework to operationalise IDS principles is proposed that is both standardised internationally and able to be tailored to the diverse contexts of Indigenous peoples. INTERPRETATION: IDS is emergent in Australia and there is a clear need to establish an agreed set of International IDS principles and a framework for their operationalisation and contextualisation across diverse Indigenous communities and contexts.

Mechanisms to address shortages are particularly important in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian Blood Services (CBS), the national blood center serving Canada except Quebec, called a national Green Advisory Phase from May to June 2020 on platelet products and O negative red blood cells, requesting daily hospital inventory reports. When such shortages occur, it may be challenging to identify which surgical procedures are likely to require platelet transfusion support and should therefore be rescheduled. Methods: Information systems maintained by the Blood Transfusion Service (Wellsky?) and the Department of Surgical Services (ORSOS?) were cross-referenced for the 2019 calendar year at a large adult teaching hospital in Toronto with active cardiovascular and transplant programs. Only procedures that were performed more than 25 times during this period were included in the analysis. Average platelet consumption on the day of surgery, 1 week post-operatively and 30 days post-operatively was calculated. Results: 50 procedures with a potential for requiring intra-operative platelet transfusion support were identified, with the greatest demand being those involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) support (27% of cases transfused, median of 2.7 units per case) and heart, liver and lung transplantation (24% of cases transfused, median of 4.2 units per case). Although spinal surgery as a group was not a high platelet consumer (4% of cases transfused, median of 0.3 units per case), certain complex procedures such as thoracic-lumbar laminectomy and thoracic-lumbar decompression and fusion were more at risk of requiring platelet support during and in the post-operative period. Due to their frequency, procedures on CPB created the highest demand in platelets with close to 4500 units distributed during the year. Standard deviations for many procedures was large, up to 10 units in the intra-operative period. Other procedures with low-risk of intra-operative platelet transfusion support but a possibility of requiring platelet transfusion in the 30-day post-operative period included renal transplantation and neurosurgical procedures. Interestingly, renal transplant patients generally did not require transfusion support during surgery or in the immediate post-operative period but only when looking at 30-day requirements. For most patients, these procedures would therefore be at risk only in the setting of very prolonged shortages. Conclusion: Data-driven demand forecasting for intra-operative and post-operative platelet transfusion support may be of value in risk-benefit analysis of proceeding with specific surgical procedures in the setting of platelet shortages. However, some of the procedures with the highest platelet consumption serve the sickest patients and cannot be postponed.

However, in many settings public health officials rarely have opportunities to interact with researchers, which is a problem further exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One prominent theory argues that policy actors will trust and utilize research findings when they perceive them to be salient, credible and legitimate. We draw on this theory to examine the conditions facilitating greater uptake of new knowledge among health officials when engagement is out of reach and they are instead exposed to new ideas through written mass communication. Using data from a survey experiment with about 260 health workers and administrators in Honduras, we find that messages from a technocratic sender based on statistical evidence improved perceptions of salience, credibility and legitimacy (SCL). Additionally, perceptions of SCL are three contextual features that operate as joint mediators between knowledge and action, and several individual characteristics also influence whether officials trust research findings enough to apply them when formulating and implementing health policies. This research can help inform the design of context-sensitive knowledge translation and exchange strategies to advance the goals of evidence-based public health, particularly in settings where direct engagement is difficult to achieve.","output":"Linking knowledge with action when engagement is out of reach: three contextual features of effective public health communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerosolized droplets play a central role in the transmission of various infectious diseases, including Legionnaire's disease, gastroenteritis-causing norovirus, and most recently COVID-19. Respiratory droplets are known to be the most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range 0.3$m$ to 3$m$, which can reach heights of at least 1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of airborne disease transmission.","output":"Aerosol generation in public restrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous challenges to the medical system.

METHODS Mechanical thrombectomy was simulated in a vascular phantom with collateral circulation. Hard fragment-prone clots (HFC) and soft elastic clots (SECs) were used to generate middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions that were retrieved by the Solitaire FR devices through (1) an 8 Fr balloon guide catheter (BGC), (2) a 5 Fr distal access catheter at the proximal aspect of the clot in the MCA (Solumbra), or (3) a 6 Fr guide catheter with the tip at the cervical internal carotid artery (guide catheter, GC).

Indigotic and, if so, to characterize their properties. We conducted a comprehensive survey on the transcription profiling database by using tBLASTn analysis. Several bioinformatics methods were employed to perform the prediction of composition and physicochemical characters. The expression levels of IiPAL genes in various tissues of I. indigotica with stress treatment were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protoplast transient transformation was used to observe the locations of IiPALs. IiPALs were functionally characterized by expression with pET-32a vector in Escherichia colis strain BL21 (DE3). Integration of transcripts and metabolite accumulations was used to reveal the relation between IiPALs and target compounds. An new gene (IiPAL2) was identified and both IiPALs had the conserved enzymatic active site Ala-Ser-Gly and were classified as members of dicotyledon. IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 were expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, with the highest expression levels of IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 being observed in stems and roots, respectively. The two genes responded to the exogenous elicitor in different manners. Subcellular localization experiment showed that both IiPALs were localized in the cytosol. The recombinant proteins were shown to catalyze the conversion of L-Phe to trans-cinnamic acid. Correlation analysis indicated that IiPAL1 was more close to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites than IiPAL2. In conclusion, the present study provides a basis for the elucidation of the role of IiPALs genes in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, which will help further metabolic engineering to improve the accumulation of bioactive components in I. indigotica.","output":"The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family in Isatis indigotica Fort.: molecular cloning, characterization, and expression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until now, Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 850,000 deaths and infected more than 27 million individuals in over 120 countries.

The purpose of this study is to describe the dental management of patients undergoing pre-HSCT examination with the Dental Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and to report on odontogenic complications. METHODS: Patients referred for evaluation as part of the standard preparation for HSCT were included. Following clinical and radiological examination, patients were assigned to one of three groups based on risk of odontogenic infection, and treatment was provided as indicated. Patients were followed, and their medical records were reviewed for odontogenic complications during the transplant admission. RESULTS: Of the 375 patients evaluated, 350 patients underwent HSCT: allogeneic 143 (40.9%) and autologous 207 (59.1%). The distribution of primary cancer diagnosis was as follows: multiple myeloma 104 (29.7%), leukemias 95 (27.1%), Hodgkin's lymphoma 28 (8.0%), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 99 (28.3%), and other conditions 24 (6.9%). The median time from dental evaluation to transplant was 29 days. The median Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth Index was 17. The median Community Periodontal Index was 1. Based on dental status, 145 patients (41.4%) were classified as low risk, 133 (38%) as moderate risk and 72 (20.6%) as high risk of odontogenic infection. One hundred fourteen patients (32.6%) required dental treatment prior to HSCT, and 100 of these (28.6%) completed treatment. Two (0.57%) patients had odontogenic complications. CONCLUSIONS: With conservative pre-HSCT dental treatment based on an infection risk classification system, a low odontogenic complication rate was observed.","output":"Dental status and risk of odontogenic complication in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunocompromise is a common condition in cats, especially due to widespread infections with immunosuppressive viruses, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), but also due to chronic non-infectious diseases, such as tumours, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease, as well as treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids, cyclosporins, or tumour chemotherapy. In this review, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicine from eleven European countries, discusses the current knowledge and rationale for vaccination of immunocompromised cats. So far, there are few data available on vaccination of immunocompromised cats, and sometimes studies produce controversial results.

Mathematical modeling papers which study the human immune response to pathogens have predicted concentrations of a variety of cells, including activated and resting macrophages, plasma cells, and antibodies. This study aims to create a comprehensive mathematical model that can predict cytokine levels in response to a gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus by coupling previous models. To accomplish this, the cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 8 (IL-8), and Interleukin 10 (IL-10) are included to quantify the relationship between cytokine release from macrophages and the concentration of the pathogen, S. aureus, ex vivo. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model cellular response and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to model cytokine response, and interactions between both components produce a more robust and more complete systems-level understanding of immune activation. In the coupled cellular and cytokine model outlined in this paper, a low concentration of S. aureus is used to stimulate the measured cellular response and cytokine expression. Results show that our cellular activation and cytokine expression model characterizing septic conditions can predict ex vivo mechanisms in response to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Our simulations provide new insights into how the human immune system responds to infections from different pathogens.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise and associated cutoff values were used to assess rates of probable major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. To provide insight into the factors shaping these and other mental health conditions, we included two open-ended questions asking respondents to recount their most upsetting and hopeful experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it made them feel. Using a hybrid inductive-abductive approach and thematic content analysis, we created a Social Ecological Model to represent themes among health workers experiences within five ecological levels: individual, interpersonal, organization, community, and public policy. Of the 1,132 participants who completed the survey, 14.0% had probable major depression, 15.8% probable generalized anxiety disorder, 23.1% probable post-traumatic stress disorder, and 42.6% probable alcohol use disorder. Individual level themes included participants personal health and self-care behaviors. Interpersonal level themes included the health of their social circle, family functioning, and social support. Organization level themes included their hospitals management, resources, patient care, routine, and teams. Themes in the community level included the media, scientific knowledge about COVID-19, morale, behavior, and support of health workers. Lastly, government and health system leadership and shelter-in-place policy were themes within the public policy level.

Transmission of SARS occurred through direct and indirect contact and large droplet nuclei. The World Health Organization recommended the use of household disinfectants, which have not been previously tested against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to disinfect potentially contaminated environmental surfaces. There is a need for a surrogate test system given the limited availability of the SARS-CoV for testing and biosafety requirements necessary to safely handle it. In this study, the antiviral activity of standard household products was assayed against murine hepatitis virus (MHV), as a potential surrogate for SARS-CoV. METHODS: A surface test method, which involves drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the product for a specific contact time, was used to determine the virucidal activity. The virus titers and log reductions were determined by the Reed and Muench tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50) end point method. RESULTS: When tested as directed, common household disinfectants or antiseptics, containing either 0.050% of triclosan, 0.12% of PCMX, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79% of ethanol, demonstrated a 3-log reduction or better against MHV without any virus recovered in a 30-second contact time. CONCLUSION: Common household disinfectants and antiseptics were effective at inactivating MHV, a possible surrogate for SARS-CoV, from surfaces when used as directed. In an outbreak caused by novel agents, it is important to know the effectiveness of disinfectants and antiseptics to prevent or reduce the possibility of human-to-human transmission via surfaces.","output":"The antiviral action of common household disinfectants and antiseptics against murine hepatitis virus, a potential surrogate for SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies about the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children are still significantly lower than those in adults.

CASE SUMMARY: A 16-month-old boy presented to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, fever, cough, and poor oral intake. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He required mechanical ventilation for rapidly progressing respiratory failure. The patient had a large mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was closed percutaneously at the age of 13 months. Moreover, we followed his hospital sequelae from admission to death. DISCUSSION: This child had multiple risk factors, including malnutrition and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH) after late closure of the VSD. The pre-existing PH could have been aggravated by the lung condition associated with COVID-19 and the respiratory failure triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with ventricular systolic dysfunction, elevated troponin serum levels and newly developed trifascicular block, which were indicative of myocardial injury. The elevated inflammatory markers and multi-organ dysfunction seem to corroborate multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which was described recently among paediatric patients with COVID-19.","output":"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 in a child who underwent ventricular septal defect device closure: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The aim of this study was to conduct a cross-sectional, observational cohort study of patients presenting for revision of a total hip, or total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, to understand current routes to revision surgery and explore differences in symptoms, healthcare use, reason for revision, and the revision surgery (surgical time, components, length of stay) between patients having regular follow-up and those without. METHODS: Data were collected from participants and medical records for the 12 months prior to revision. Patients with previous revision, metal-on-metal articulations, or hip hemiarthroplasty were excluded. Participants were retrospectively classified as Planned or Unplanned revision. Multilevel regression and propensity score matching were used to compare the two groups. RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 568 patients, recruited in 38 UK secondary care sites between October 2017 and October 2018 (43.5% male; mean (SD) age 71.86 years (9.93); 305 hips, 263 knees). No significant inclusion differences were identified between the two groups. For hip revision, time to revision > ten years (odds ratio (OR) 3.804, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.353 to 10.694), p = 0.011), periprosthetic fracture (OR 20.309, 95% CI (4.574 to 90.179), p < 0.001), and dislocation (OR 12.953, 95% CI (4.014 to 41.794), p < 0.001), were associated with unplanned revision. For knee, there were no associations with route to revision. Revision after ten years was more likely for those who were younger at primary surgery, regardless of route to revision. No significant differences in cost outcomes, length of surgery time, and access to a health professional in the year prior to revision were found between the two groups. When periprosthetic fractures, dislocations, and infections were excluded, healthcare use was significantly higher in the unplanned revision group. CONCLUSION: Differences between characteristics for patients presenting for planned and unplanned revision are minimal. Although there was greater healthcare use in those having unplanned revision, it appears unlikely that routine orthopaedic review would have detected many of these issues. It may be safe to disinvest in standard follow-up provided there is rapid access to orthopaedic review.

The COVID-19 pandemic has massively increased the rate of ALI incidence. The pathogenesis of ALI involves tissue damage from invading microbes and, in severe cases, the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This study aimed to develop a therapy to normalize the excess production of inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue repair in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Based on our previous studies, we tested the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and BTP-2 therapies. IGF-I was selected, because we and others have shown that elevated inflammatory cytokines suppress the expression of growth hormone receptors in the liver, leading to a decrease in the circulating IGF-I. IGF-I is a growth factor that increases vascular protection, enhances tissue repair, and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines.

BTP-2, an inhibitor of cytosolic calcium, was used to suppress the LPS-induced increase in cytosolic calcium, which otherwise leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. We showed that LPS increased the expression of the primary inflammatory mediators such as toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), IL-1, interleukin-17 (IL-17), TNF-, and interferon- (IFN-), which were normalized by the IGF-I + BTP-2 dual therapy in the lungs, along with improved vascular gene expression markers. The histologic lung injury score was markedly elevated by LPS and reduced to normal by the combination therapy. In conclusion, the LPS-induced increases in inflammatory cytokines, vascular injuries, and lung injuries were all improved by IGF-I + BTP-2 combination therapy.","output":"The Effects of Insulin-Like Growth Factor I and BTP-2 on Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide, the scientific community has been under pressure to react and make progress in the development of an effective treatment against the virus responsible for the disease. Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus replication. Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses. In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results. Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 M, respectively.","output":"Prediction of Novel Inhibitors of the Main Protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2 through Consensus Docking and Drug Reposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internal organs heal injuries with new connective tissue, but the cellular and molecular events of this process remain obscure.

Single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic and chemical screens indicated that the preexisting matrix was transferred by neutrophils dependent on the HSF-integrin AM/B2-kindlin3 cascade.

Its effects on infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are also not well-studied, and more evidence is needed on vertical transmission of the disease from mother to infant and on the transmission of IgG/IgM antibodies between mother and infant. We aim to systematically review and evaluate the effects of COVID-19 among SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women in late pregnancy and neonates with SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant mothers using blood assays to find indicators of maternal and neonatal complications. We searched for original published articles in Google Scholar, Medline (PubMed), and Embase databases to identify articles in the English language from December 2019 to July 20, 2020. Duplicate entries were searched by their titles, authors, date of publication, and Digital Object Identifier. The selected studies were included based on patient pregnancy on admission, pregnant mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus, maternal/neonatal complications, and blood test results. We excluded duplicate studies, articles where full text was not available, other languages than English, opinions, and perspectives. The meta-analysis using the Generalized Linear Mixed model was conducted using the meta and metaprop packages in R code. Of the 1,642 studies assessed for eligibility, 29 studies (375 mothers and neonates) were included. Preterm birth rate was 34.2%, and cesarean section rate was 82.7%. Maternal laboratory findings found elevated neutrophils (71.4%; 95% CI: 38.5C90.9), elevated CRP (67.7%; 95%: 50.6C81.1), and low hemoglobin (57.3%; 95% CI: 26.0C87.8). We found platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin to be less strongly correlated with preterm birth than between high neutrophil counts (P = 0.0007), low hemoglobin (P = 0.0188), and risk of preterm birth. There is little evidence for vertical transmission. Elevated procalcitonin levels (23.2%; 95% CI: 8.4C49.8) are observed in infants born to mothers with COVID-19, which could indicate risk for neonatal sepsis.

Although pregnant womens attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination are well studied, husbands views toward COVID-19 vaccination for these women have not been surveyed. We aimed to determine the rates and associated factors of accepting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy among Thai pregnant women and their spouses and to evaluate the actual rate of vaccination during pregnancy among these women. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted at a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 176 Thai pregnant woman/husband dyads who attended our antenatal care clinic between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 were consecutively recruited for evaluations of their accepting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. After delivery, data on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy among pregnant women were extracted from the hospitals electronic database. RESULTS: After exclusion of five pregnant women with prepregnancy COVID-19 vaccination, 171 women and 176 male partners were included. The rates of accepting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy were 60.8% and 61.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that having a husband who favored COVID-19 vaccination for his wife was independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 4.82; 95% confidence interval 2.34, 9.94). However, confidence in vaccine safety was an associated factor of the husbands willingness to have his wife vaccinated for COVID-19 during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 12.56; 95% confidence interval 2.35, 67.18). The actual rate of vaccination during pregnancy was 88.3%.

These data have revealed the emergence of lineages with mutations associated to transmissibility and antigenicity, known as variants of concern (VOCs). A striking aspect of VOCs is that many of them involve an unusually large number of defining mutations. Current phylogenetic estimates of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have around 15 defining mutations and it is hypothesised that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time. We analysed genome sequence data from the GISAID database to assess whether the emergence of VOCs can be attributed to changes in the evolutionary rate of the virus and whether this pattern can be detected at a phylogenetic level using genome data. We fit a range of molecular clock models and assessed their statistical fit. Our analyses indicate that the emergence of VOCs is driven by an episodic increase in the evolutionary rate of around 4-fold the background phylogenetic rate estimate that may have lasted several weeks or months. These results underscore the importance of monitoring the molecular evolution of the virus as a means of understanding the circumstances under which VOCs may emerge.","output":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is driven by acceleration of the evolutionary rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most pregnancy-related sacral stress fractures occur after delivery.

Similarly, the number of complete viral genome sequences produced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), increased exponentially. NGS enables a rapid accumulation of a large number of sequences. However, bioinformatics analyses are critical and require combined approaches for data analysis, which can be challenging for non-bioinformaticians. Results A user-friendly and sequencing platform-independent bioinformatics pipeline, named SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY (REconstruction of CoronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis) has been developed to build SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from raw sequencing reads and to investigate variants. The genomes built by SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY were compared with those obtained using other software available and revealed comparable or better performances of SARSCCoV2 RECoVERY. Depending on the number of reads, the complete genome reconstruction and variants analysis can be achieved in less than one hour. The pipeline was implemented in the multi-usage open-source Galaxy platform allowing an easy access to the software and providing computational and storage resources to the community. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY is a piece of software destined to the scientific community working on SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and molecular characterisation, providing a performant tool for the complete reconstruction and variants analysis of the viral genome.

The country of Georgia conducts sentinel surveillance to monitor SARI activity and changes in its infectious etiology. This study characterizes the epidemiology of SARI in Georgia over the 2015/16 and 2016/17 influenza seasons, compares clinical presentations by etiology, and estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative design. METHODS: SARI cases were selected through alternate day systematic sampling between September 2015 and March 2017 at five sentinel surveillance inpatient sites. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex diagnostic system. We present SARI case frequencies by demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and clinical presentation, and used logistic regression to estimate influenza A vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: 1,624 patients with SARI were identified. More cases occurred in February (28.7%; 466/1624) than other months. Influenza was the dominant pathogen in December-February, respiratory syncytial virus in March-May, and rhinovirus in June-November. Serious clinical symptoms including breathing difficulties, ICU hospitalization, and artificial ventilation were common among influenza A and human metapneumovirus cases. For influenza A/H3, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Multi-pathogen diagnostic testing through Georgias sentinel surveillance provides useful information on etiology, seasonality, and demographic associations.

For CINV prophylaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RAs) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) are usually administered together with dexamethasone, which may increase the risk of serious infections in patients undergoing myeloablative treatment. The rationale of this multicenter, open-label and phase IIa study was to explore the efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA (netupitant/palonosetron) given as an every-other-day regimen without dexamethasone in preventing CINV in patients with relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R-NHL), eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and treated with MD-HD-CT. Seventy patients participated to the study. According to the adopted Fleming one-stage design, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved. The CR values were 87.1% (primary endpoint, overall phase: days 1-8), 88.6% (acute phase: days 1-6), and 98.6% (delayed phase: days 7-8), while complete control (CR with no more than mild nausea) was 85.7% (overall phase), 88.6% (acute phase), and 95.7% (delayed phase). Moderate and severe episodes of nausea were reported by less than 10% of patients in the overall phase and less than 5% in both the acute and delayed phases. Regarding safety, NEPA was well tolerated with only one adverse event (constipation) evaluated as possibly related to NEPA administration.

The 2018 International Consensus Meeting suggested that a variation trend toward normalization in serum markers was useful for determining the proper timing of reimplantation. However, the opposite results were found by previous studies, and the normalization of serum markers was reported to fail to predict infection control. We investigated whether value changes and percent changes in four common serum markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and fibrinogen) can predict persistent infection. METHODS A retrospective review of 141 patients treated with the two-stage revision from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. The variation trend in serum indicators was evaluated by the percent changes (using values of serum markers pre-reimplantation divided by values pre-resection) and value changes (using values of serum markers pre-resection minus values pre-reimplantation). Treatment success was defined according to the Delphi-based consensus criteria with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) was used to examine the usefulness of changes in serum markers. RESULTS Twenty-two patients (15.60%) were persistently infected. No significant difference was found in either the value change or percent change in serum markers between reinfection and non-reinfection patients. When predicting persistent infection, the area under the curves (AUC) demonstrated that both percent changes and value changes in serum markers were poor indicators. The AUC of value changes was 0.533 for the CRP, 0.504 for the IL-6, 0.508 for the ESR, and 0.586 for fibrinogen when predicted persistent PJI. In addition, the AUC indicated that percent changes in the CRP (0.464), the IL-6 (0.534), the ESR (0.527), and fibrinogen (0.586) were all poor markers. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that both value changes and percent changes in serum markers were not sufficiently rigorous to aid in persistent infection diagnosis.

The main protease of the coronavirus is essential in the viral replication and is involved in polyprotein cleavage and immune regulation, making it an effective target when developing the treatment. A Number of approved antiviral drugs were tested against COVID-19 virus using molecular docking analysis by calculating the free natural affinity of the binding ligand to the active site pocket and the catalytic residues without forcing the docking of the ligand to active site. COVID-19 virus protease solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7) is targeted by repurposed drugs. The molecular docking analysis results have shown that the binding of Remdesivir and Mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide with the protein drug target has optimal binding features supporting that Remdesivir and Mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide can be used as potential anti-viral treatment against COVID-19 disease.","output":"In silico molecular docking analysis for repurposing approved antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United States has had, by far, the world's greatest civilian ownership of firearms. An even greater ownership occurred during the Covd-19 pandemic, mostly of handguns and including many new owners. The U.S. has also had the least progress of the 41 highest sociodemographic countries ranked by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in reducing the unintentional firearm mortality rate in young children. This study characterized the unintentional firearm mortality trends in American 1-4 year-olds by sex and race/ethnicity and evaluated the trends in the context of firearm prevalence in the U.S. METHODS: Mortality data for 1999-2018 were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm injury and mortality data for 2016-2020 from Everytown for Gun Safety #NotAnAccident database, firearm background check data for 1999-2020 from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence for 2017 from the Small Arms Survey. RESULTS: In American 1-4 year-olds, the rate of unintentional firearm deaths during 1999-2018 increased exponentially at an average annual percent rate of 4.9 (p < 0.001) and was greatest in non-Hispanic black children. Unintentional firearm deaths had the most rapid increase of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. The unintentional firearm death rate increase was correlated with the concurrent rate of firearm background checks and handgun permits issued (each p < 0.001) and in non-Hispanic white children with handgun prevalence in their families (p = 0.03). Globally, the unintentional firearm death rate was also correlated with firearm prevalence (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in fatal firearm accidents in the United States death rate among 1-4 year-olds is directly associated with the steadily increasing prevalence of firearms. The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans, especially among non-Hispanic black children, requires urgent solutions to address firearm prevalence and access. The problem is expected to become even more urgent as a result of the record high firearm sales that occurred in the United States during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Increasing Rate of Unintentional Firearm Deaths in Youngest Americans: Firearm Prevalence and Covid-19 Pandemic Implication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To determine the main risk factors associated with COVID-19 in SLE patients. Methods: The Reuma CoV Brazil is a multicenter, observational, prospective cohort designed to monitor immune-mediated rheumatic diseases patients during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil. SLE adult patients according to SLE SLICC criteria classification (2012), with and without (control group-CG) COVID-19 diagnosis were matched. Demographic data, managing of COVID-19, comorbidities, clinical characteristics (disease activity: Patient Report Outcomes-PROs, Physician Global Assessment and SLEDAI-2 K)were collected. Results: From May 2020 to January 2021, 604 SLE patients were included, 317 (52.4%) with COVID-19 and 287 (47.6%) in the CG. Both groups were homogeneous and comparable regarding sex and comorbidities. SLE patients with COVID-19 declared a lower level of social isolation (49.5% vs. 61.9%;p = 0.002), worked more commonly in health professions (10.4% vs. 3.5%;p = 0.002), presented more frequently joint (32.5% vs. 22.0%;p = 0.004) and hematological manifestations (18.0% vs. 11.5%;p = 0.025). SLEDAI-2 K did not differ among groups prior and after COVID-19 infection. However, considering the mean duration of COVID-19 symptoms (12.1  8.8 days), infected patients had more severe disease activity's PROs after resolution of COVID-19 symptoms (2.9  2.9 vs. 2.3  2.6;p = 0.031). The hospitalization rate was 20.5% (n = 65), of whom 23 (7.2%) needed intensive care unit and 14 (4.4%) patients died. Hypertension [5,26 (1,9714,07);p = 0.001] and recently cyclophosphamide pulses [39,21 (4,17-368,53);p = 0.001] were associated with hospitalization and patients who received telemedicine medical care presented 72% less chance of hospitalization [0.28 (0.09-0.83);p = 0.023). Conclusion: COVID-19 was associated with a lower level of declared social isolation and more severe disease activity perception after SARS-CoV-2 infection according to PROs. Hypertension and cyclophosphamide were associated with hospitalization and telemedicine can be a useful tool for SLE patients with COVID-19. These data should be considered to perform public health policy and national guidelines to manage SLE patients during the pandemic, as well as to prioritize some special groups for the immunization program.","output":"Lupus patients infected by sars-cov2 performed less social isolation with higher hospitalization associated with hypertensionand cyclophosphamide pulsotherapy-data from reumacov Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine was first introduced in Neurology as a tool to facilitate access to acute stroke treatment.

This study aimed to examine the prevalence and identify the risk factors of undernutrition among children under-five years in Bambao region, Comoros. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bambao region among 837 under-five years and their caregivers. Analyses were conducted using both descriptive and logistic regression to examine the magnitude and factors associated with stunting, wasting and underweight. RESULTS: Prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight were 21.6, 13.7, and 13.6% respectively. Factors associated with stunting were caregiver's secondary education level compared to no education (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.04C3.43, P < 0.04), age of child between 13C24 months compared to 0C12 months (AOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.44C5.01, P < 0.001), and food insecurity (AOR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.20C5.41, P < 0.02). Children aged 25C59 months were 78% less likely to have wasting compared to those with 0C12 months (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10C0.51, P < 0.001). Wasting was also associated with food insecurity (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.12C6.49, P < 0.03), and low birthweight (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.73C5.94, P < 0.001). Children aged between 25C59 months were 86% less likely to have underweight compared to those aged 0C12 months (AOR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06C0.36, P < 0.001). Food insecurity (AOR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.08C6.54, P < 0.03), low birthweight (AOR = 3.15, 95% CI: 1.67C5.93, P < 0.001), and non-exclusively breastfeeding (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.15C4.90, P < 0.02) were also associated with underweight.

METHODS: An online survey involving 1068 of consented HCWs that included nurses, physicians, and public health officers was conducted in May 2020. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were performed on the collected data. RESULTS: Although no significant difference in peritraumatic distress was observed among the surveyed HCWs, the workers experience of emotional exhaustion varied according to work characteristics. Respondents who were female, older, living with a spouse, and/or full-time workers reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Public health officers and other medical personnel who did not have direct contact with confirmed patients and full-time workers had a higher level of peritraumatic distress. Forced involvement in work related to COVID-19, worry about stigma, worry about becoming infected, and perceived sufficiency of organizational support negatively predict emotional exhaustion and peritraumatic distress.

METHODS: We adapted a model of HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of approximately 103,000 men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, PrEP, ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS: A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23,800 cases). If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases.

A novel carbon tax attractor is achieved through the discussion of the dynamic behavior of the new system. Based on the genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, the quantitative coefficients of the actual system are identified. The scenario analysis results show that, under the same tax rate and constraint conditions, the ESER system in YRD urban agglomerations is superior to the average case in China, in which the impacts on economic growth are almost the same. The formers energy intensity is lower and the shock resistance is stronger. It is found that economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main cause for the ESER system of YRD urban agglomerations being superior. In the current YRD urban agglomerations ESER system, energy intensity cannot be adjusted to an ideal level by commercialization management and government control; however, it is under effective control of carbon tax incentives. Therefore, strengthening the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and effective utilization of carbon tax incentives could perfectly control energy intensity, without obvious potential negative impact on economic growth.","output":"Investigating carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerationsAnalysis of a novel ESER system with carbon tax constraints and its application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of life worldwide The aim of the present study was to review and describe and acknowledge the impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric health care system at a pediatric tertiary hospital in Wenzhou Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, a public pediatric tertiary hospital in Southern Zhejiang Province that specializes in pediatrics The data regarding the primary diagnosis of patients were extracted from the electronic medical records system of the hospital Data for outpatients and inpatients treated at the pediatric department were analyzed in the time frame of 22 weeks since the beginning of the pandemic (from December 30, 2019 to June 2, 2020) and compared with data from the same period in 2019 Results: The total number of outpatient cases in the previous 22 weeks of the year declined from 560,620 in 2019 to 247,030 in 2020, and inpatient cases decreased from 14,177 to 7,555 This negative trend settled by week 6 and 7 and subsequently approached the 2019 numbers The most noticeable decrease in the number of cases was observed in children of preschool age Moreover, the number of weekly visits decreased at the beginning of the epidemic, reached the lowest value during the lockdown period, and recovered after the lockdown Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, clinical practice in a pediatric department in Wenzhou was substantially affected by the epidemic and measures such as physical distancing and increased personal hygiene, particularly in preschool-age children An understanding of the trends and impacts of the pandemic on pediatric patients and health systems will facilitate better preparation of pediatricians in the future ?

Therefore, organizations rely on Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) to support them in better understanding the threats and associated impacts of cyber events. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of cyber security data, often with multidimensional attributes, sophisticated visualization techniques are needed to achieve CSA. However, there have been no previous attempts to systematically review and analyze the scientific literature on CSA visualizations. In this paper, we systematically select and review 54 publications that discuss visualizations to support CSA. We extract data from these papers to identify key stakeholders, information types, data sources, and visualization techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the level of CSA supported by the visualizations, alongside examining the maturity of the visualizations, challenges, and practices related to CSA visualizations to prepare a full analysis of the current state of CSA in an organizational context. Our results reveal certain gaps in CSA visualizations. For instance, the largest focus is on operational-level staff, and there is a clear lack of visualizations targeting other types of stakeholders such as managers, higher-level decision makers, and non-expert users. Most papers focus on threat information visualization, and there is a dearth of papers that visualize impact information, response plans, and information shared within teams.

The incidence of these rare variants was approximately 69.0% (60/87). Twenty-five novel variants and 29 reported variants were identified. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, thirty-three variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and 21 variants were assessed as variants of uncertain significance. The overall diagnostic rate was about 42.5% based on the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. Androgen receptor (AR), steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 (SRD5A2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 5 Group A member 1 (NR5A1) gene variants were identified in 21, 13 and 13 patients, respectively. The incidence of these three gene variants was about 78.3% (47/60) in patients with rare variants. It is concluded that targeted NGS is an effective method to detect pathogenic mutations in 46,XY DSD patients and AR, SRD5A2, and NR5A1 genes were the most common pathogenic genes in our cohort.s.","output":"Prevalence of gene mutations in a Chinese 46,XY disorders of sex development cohort detected by targeted next-generation sequencing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Subclinical tuberculosis (TB) represents a substantial proportion of individuals with TB disease, although limited evidence is available to understand the epidemiological characteristics of these cases. We aimed to explore the prevalence of subclinical patients with TB and identify the underlying association between the subclinical TB cases in the study setting and the Beijing genotype. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among patients with incident TB at the Fifth Peoples Hospital of Suzhou between January and December 2018. A total of 380 patients with TB were included in our analysis. Results: Of the 380 patients, 81.8% were active TB cases, whereas the other 18.2% were subclinical TB cases. Compared with patients aged 65 years and older, the risk of having subclinical TB is higher among younger patients. The use of smear, culture, and Xpert identified 3, 16, and 13 subclinical TB cases, respectively. When using a combination of positive culture and Xpert results, the sensitivity improved to 33.3%. In addition, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly elevated in the active TB group compared with that in the subclinical TB group. We also observed that the proportion of the Beijing genotype in the subclinical TB group was significantly lower than that in the active TB group. Conclusion: To conclude, our data demonstrate that approximately one-fifth of patients with TB were subclinical in Suzhou. Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be detected by the existing microbiologic diagnostics in one-third of patients with subclinical TB. The patients with subclinical TB are more prone to having low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio values than those with active TB.

Virtual clinic encounters using a video chat platform or a simple telephone call offer the patient and surgeon numerous advantages that are now better appreciated by the orthopedic community at large. However, barriers to effective patient evaluation exist, and a successful patient assessment is highly dependent on technique. In particular, performing a shoulder physical examination during a virtual encounter poses many obstacles. We present a technique to complete a patient-led, comprehensive shoulder physical examination using an easy-to-understand pictorial guide called the Shoulder Telehealth Assessment Tool (STAT). A STAT form is provided to the patient and designed to be completed at home without the real-time instruction of a provider, before the virtual encounter.

As people around the world through government directive or independent choice moved into protective isolation, immunosuppressed children who routinely require medical management were challenged with necessary public ventures to health care facilities. Medical centers adapted by developing new approaches to care for immunocompromised children such as expanding telemedicine services and conversion to at home immune therapies to reduce infectious exposure. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic patients prior to medical therapies became routine in most modern health care units and development of highly sensitive assays was critical to avoid patient and staff exposure as well as initiation of new immunosuppressive treatment in positive patients. As the prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) amplified and infected immunocompromised patients became more common, questions quickly arose including how aggressively to treat the infection with most agents still in clinical trials. Additionally how should chronic immunosuppressant drugs that may interfere with the ability to clear the virus be adjusted? Finally, what if the infection leads to excessive immune responses or flares of the underlying disorder? In this review, we explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunocompromised children during the first year, summarizing what is known and yet to be discovered, approaches to testing and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, considerations in management of underlying immune suppressive medications, outcomes published to date, and strategies for vaccinating this unique population.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Immunocompromised Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, named as 2019-nCoV temporarily and COVID-19 formally by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 February 2020.

We simulated the C-SEIR model and key important parameters. The results show that (1) increasing peoples awareness of the virus can effectively reduce the spread of the virus; (2) as the capability and possibility of indirect infection increases, the proportion of people being infected will also increase; (3) the increased cure rate can effectively reduce the number of infected people. Then, the virus transmission can be modelled and used for the inflexion and extinction period of pandemic development so as to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in the decision-making of pandemic prevention and recovery of economic production.

Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was conducted for weighted-mean-difference (WMD) and odds-ratio (OR) . Results: : A total of 30 studies involving 5741 survivors and 1670 deaths were included. The death cases were significantly older than survivors (WMD=15.36, 95% CI: 12.90-17.82), male and smoking history showed higher risk to develop fatal outcome (OR=3.37, 95% CI: 2.27-5.01;OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.02-1.83, respectively).

Our main objective was to investigate how measurement indicator variables affect external validity in clinical prediction models for predicting onset of vasopressor therapy. DESIGN: We fit logistic regressions on retrospective cohorts to predict vasopressor onset using two classes of variables: seemingly objective clinical variables (vital signs and laboratory measurements) and more subjective variables denoting recency of measurements. SETTING: Three cohorts from two tertiary-care academic hospitals in geographically distinct regions, spanning general inpatient and critical care settings. PATIENTS: Each cohort consisted of adult patients (age greater than or equal to 18 yr at time of hospitalization), with lengths of stay between 6 and 600 hours, and who did not receive vasopressors in the first 6 hours of hospitalization or ICU admission. Models were developed on each of the three derivation cohorts and validated internally on the derivation cohort and externally on the other two cohorts. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of vasopressors was 0.9% in the general inpatient cohort and 12.4% and 11.5% in the two critical care cohorts. Models utilizing both classes of variables performed the best in-sample, with C-statistics for predicting vasopressor onset in 4 hours of 0.862 (95% CI, 0.844C0.879), 0.822 (95% CI, 0.793C0.852), and 0.889 (95% CI, 0.880C0.898). Models solely using the subjective variables denoting measurement recency had poor external validity. However, these practice-driven variables helped adjust for differences between the two hospitals and led to more generalizable models using clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated models for predicting the onset of vasopressors. We found that practice-specific features denoting measurement recency improved local performance and also led to more generalizable models if they are adjusted for during model development but discarded at validation. The role of practice-specific features such as measurement indicators in clinical prediction modeling should be carefully considered if the goal is to develop generalizable models.","output":"Generalization in Clinical Prediction Models: The Blessing and Curse of Measurement Indicator Variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contribution: While research indicates usefulness of remote laboratories in teaching of digital hardware systems, their main application is to complement stationary classes.

In addition, we provide a comparison with SARS-CoV-2-infected adult NHP. Infection of the neonate resulted in a mild disease compared with adult NHPs that develop, in most cases, moderate lung lesions.

Human-to-human transmission has been documented, indicating that FTLSV should be considered a potential public health threat. Determining the historical spread of FTLSV could help curtail its spread and prevent future movement of this virus. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To examine the pattern of FTLSV evolution and the origin of outbreak strains, as well to examine the rate of evolution, the genome of 12 FTLSV strains were sequenced and a phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of all available FTLSV sequences in China were performed. Analysis based on the FTLSV L segment suggests that the virus likely originated somewhere in Huaiyangshan circa 1790 (95% highest probability density interval: 1756C1817) and began spreading around 1806 (95% highest probability density interval: 1773C1834). Analysis also indicates that when FTLSV arrived in Jiangsu province from Huaiyangshan, Jiangsu Province became another source for the spread of the disease. Bayesian factor test analysis identified three major transmission routes: Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu, Jiangsu to Liaoning, and Jiangsu to Shandong. The speed of FTLSV movement has increased in recent decades, likely facilitated by modern human activity and ecosystem changes. In addition, evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found in FTLSV; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force in the evolution of this virus. CONCLUSION: Results presented in the manuscript suggest that the Huaiyangshan area is likely be the origin of FTLSV in China and identified probable viral migration routes. These results provide new insights into the origin and spread of FTLSV in China, and provide a foundation for future virological surveillance and control.","output":"The Evolutionary History and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukocytopenia Syndrome Virus (FTLSV) in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mitotic activity index is a key prognostic measure in tumour grading.

It is an uncommon syndrome with elusive pathophysiologic mechanisms. We observed POS in patients of moderate COVID-19 who required hospital admission to our indoor facility and oxygen supplementation when saturation was documented in sitting and supine positions for evaluation of platypnea. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted an observational, cross sectional, retrospective analysis of pulse oximetry readings of patients with stage 2 COVID-19 admitted in ward during the period from 15th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. The difference in the peripheral oxygen saturation in sitting and supine positions, documented as a routine standard of care, especially in patients with platypnea, was calculated and demographic details and co-morbidities were noted from indoor record forms. RESULTS Of the 53 patients of stage 2 COVID-19 who were included in the study, 15 (28%) had platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome at the time of presentation and 18(33.9%) patients with platypnoea had  3% desaturation in sitting position as compared to supine position. Rest of the 20 (37.7%) patients had neither platypnoea nor orthodeoxia. All the patients presenting with platypnoea-orthodeoxia required oxygen therapy during the course of treatment. Amongst the 33 patients who were hypoxic and required oxygen supplementation, 15 patients (45.4%) had oxygen saturation of 94% in the supine position at presentation. CONCLUSION Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome is common in patients with stage 2 COVID 19 infection who require oxygen therapy. POS can be easily documented by using pulse oximeter without the need of any specialised equipment. Hence, we propose that documentation of POS at the time of admission in primary health care or resource depleted settings would help in successful triage of the patients needing oxygen therapy.

However, there is concern about offering corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal pain because of the possibility of secondary adrenal insufficiency. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies, we asked: (1) Are corticosteroid injections associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency as measured by 7-day morning serum cortisol? (2) Does this association differ depending on whether the shot was administered in the spine or the appendicular skeleton? METHODS We searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Embase, EmCare, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to January 22, 2021. We retrieved 4303 unique records, of which 17 were eventually included. Study appraisal was via the Downs and Black tool, with an average quality rating of fair. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment was conducted with the overall certainty of evidence being low to moderate. Reflecting heterogeneity in the study estimates, a pooled random-effects estimate of cortisol levels 7 days after corticosteroid injection was calculated. Fifteen studies or subgroups (254 participants) provided appropriate estimates for statistical pooling. A total of 106 participants received a spine injection, and 148 participants received an appendicular skeleton injection, including the glenohumeral joint, subacromial bursa, trochanteric bursa, and knee. RESULTS Seven days after corticosteroid injection, the mean morning serum cortisol was 212 nmol/L (95% confidence interval 133 to 290), suggesting that secondary adrenal insufficiency was a possible outcome. There is a difference in the secondary adrenal insufficiency risk depending on whether the injection was in the spine or the appendicular skeleton. For spinal injection, the mean cortisol was 98 nmol/L (95% CI 48 to 149), suggesting secondary adrenal insufficiency was likely. For appendicular skeleton injection the mean cortisol was 311 nmol/L (95% CI 213 to 409) suggesting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis integrity was likely. CONCLUSION Clinicians offering spinal injections should discuss the possibility of short-term secondary adrenal insufficiency with patients, and together, they can decide whether the treatment remains appropriate and whether mitigation strategies are needed. Clinicians offering appendicular skeleton injections should not limit care because of concerns about secondary adrenal insufficiency based on the best available evidence, and clinical guidelines could be reviewed accordingly. Further research is needed to understand whether age and/or sex determine risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency and what clinical impact secondary adrenal insufficiency has on patients undergoing spinal injection.

Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","output":"Bayesian Phylogeography Finds Its Roots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the level of anxiety in elderly individuals during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Ankara province of Turkey and determine its associated factors.

Methods used include computerized transmission to public health of initial coroner's case reports, e-mailed requests to the coroner to obtain cultures, having all results of coroner's cultures come through a single person who reports contagious disease as necessary, and including infectious disease screening in retrospective case review.","output":"Improving Contagious Disease Reporting in a Medical Examiner's Office."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The synthesis of &#945;-fluorinated methyl ketones has always been challenging.

Kidney function decline is prevalent in this course. Methods: To explore the exact role of deteriorated kidney function, we applied a retrospective cohort study including 1266 participants in Wuhan Tongren Hospital between January 27 and March 3, 2020. Demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities history, organ function data and outcomes were extracted. Deteriorated kidney function was identified as the decline percentage, assessed by an increase in peak serum creatinine from the baseline. Mediating effect was calculated by mediation analysis. Key Results 1266 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (6015 years, 47.8% are male) were included, with an overall in-hospital death rate of 4.42% (56/1266). For critical cases, 77.02% had at least one preexisting comorbidity. Patients with comorbidities suffered higher in-hospital death and more severe decline of kidney function. Compared to patients with minor function decline (<10%), significant risk increase was found in those with more severe one (OR 3.57;95%CI 1.70 to 7.52;P=.001 for moderate with 10-50% decline, and 37.45;95%CI 18.71 to 74.55;P.001 for severe with>50%). More interestingly, the mediation analysis found deteriorated kidney function played as an important mediator between different comorbidities and COVID-19 patients in-hospital death, with the mediation effect of 11%, 12%, 16% and 32% respectively for hypertension, COPD, CVD and CKD.Conclusion s Deteriorated kidney function is strongly associated with increase of in-hospital death in COVID-19 and partially mediates the facilitating effect of preexisting comorbidities on in-hospital death. Thus, dynamic monitoring kidney function, preventing the deterioration of kidney function might be helpful to improve survival in COVID-19 patients, especially those with preexisting comorbidities.","output":"Mediating Effect of Deteriorated Kidney Function in Comorbidity-related Excess Deaths in COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Subfertility is a risk factor for testicular cancers (TT), and conversely, TT may induce subfertility due to local and regional toxic effects.

Overall, eight non-randomised studies involving 469 men with TT (azoospermia, n = 57; no azoospermia n = 412) were included in the qualitative analysis. Bilateral TT (12.3% vs 2.9% in non-azoospermia), non-seminoma germ cell tumours (6.4% vs 1.9%), germ cell neoplasia in-situ (GCNIS) (11.1% vs 1.2%), stage 2-3 disease (22.2% vs 0%), Sertoli Cell only (SCO) on biopsy (60% vs 37.5%) and a history of undescended testis (UDT) (66.7% vs 50%) were more common in azoospermic men.

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of patients aged 80 years and older admitted to the acute hospital in March and April 2020 with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited from 10 acute hospitals in Belgium. Recruitment was done through a network of geriatricians. RESULTS: Overall, 766 octogenarians were admitted of whom 49 were excluded because no therapeutic relationship with the geriatrician and six because of incomplete case report form. Early decisions not to consider intensive care admission were taken in 474/711 (66.7%) patients. This subgroup was characterized by significantly higher age, higher number of comorbidities and higher frailty level. There was a significant association between the degree of the treatment limitation and the degree of premorbid frailty (p < 0.001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.6% in patients with an early decision not to consider intensive care admission (67.1% in persons who developed respiratory failure vs 16.7% in patients without respiratory failure (p < 0.001)).

An online survey, using a closed-ended questionnaire, was employed. Variables included parents' sociodemographic and COVID-19 related characteristics;students' sociodemographic characteristics;distance learning context;parental involvement;and students' autonomy.

Findings revealed that Portuguese parents supported their children during the pandemic mainly through the monitoring of attention in classes and task realization. However, several variables appear to significantly determine parental involvement time, which is higher when students attend public schools, when they are less autonomous and younger, when parents' level of education is lower, when the child is a boy (except in secondary education where gender is not relevant), and when the online school time is higher. Findings highlight the need for a significant investment of time from parents, particularly of primary school children, making it difficult to cohere work or telework with school activities.

Still, there is no reasonable model to describe the creep of the consolidation effect. To accurately describe the consolidation effect of an asphalt mixture during the viscoelastic deformation process, a modified time hardening model was established by using the Malthus model and the Logistic function to change its creep strain and creep compliance. According to the characteristics of asphalt mixture creep, a single penetration creep test was conducted for high-elasticity modified asphalt mixtures at different temperatures (20 C, 40 C, 60 C) and various loading levels (0.55 MPa, 0.70 MPa, 0.85 MPa, 1.00 MPa). The test results showed that the effect of stress on deformation within the normal range of variation was more significant than that of temperature. In addition, the test results were simulated by the modified time hardening model using surface fitting and compared with a time hardening model and a modified Burgers model. A fitting analysis showed that the modified time hardening model more accurately represents the asphalt mixture's consolidation effect and creep behavior.

For other viruses like human rhinoviruses (HRVs) this is less well established. Viral or bacterial co-infections are often considered essential for severe manifestations of these virus infections. OBJECTIVE: The study aims at identifying viruses that may cause SARI in children in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infections, at identifying disease characteristics associated with these single virus infections, and at identifying a possible correlation between viral loads and disease severities. STUDY DESIGN: Between April 2007 and March 2012, we identified children (<18 year) with or without a medical history, admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with SARI or to the medium care (MC) with an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) (controls). Data were extracted from the clinical and laboratory databases of our tertiary care paediatric hospital. Patient specimens were tested for fifteen respiratory viruses with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays and we selected patients with a single virus infection only. Typical bacterial co-infections were considered unlikely to have contributed to the PICU or MC admission based on C-reactive protein-levels or bacteriological test results if performed. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients admitted to PICU with SARI and 40 patients admitted to MC with ARTI. Twelve viruses were associated with SARI, ten of which were also associated with ARTI in the absence of typical bacterial and viral co-infections, with RSV and HRV being the most frequent causes. Viral loads were not different between PICU-SARI patients and MC-ARTI patients.

An adequate nutritional status, including micronutrient status is critical for pregnancy and offspring development; however, there is a lack of evidence regarding maternal dietary micronutrient intake and its relationship with BMI in the COVID-19 era. Henceforth, we sought to assess the adequacy of maternal dietary micronutrient intake and its relationship with BMI in pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 810 Chilean pregnant women (>18 years) enrolled between March and October 2020 in Santiago, Chile. Maternal lifestyle, anthropometric and dietary intake (24-hr recall, n = 389) information was collected in the first trimester by telephonic interviews and from clinical records. Folate, calcium, iron, vitamins B-6, B-12 and D intake was estimated using the USDA nutrient database. Pre-pregnancy BMI was categorized according to the WHO criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 70% of women were classified as overweight or obese. Median (IQR) daily intake was 1.3 (0.8C1.8) mg for B-6, 2.5 (1.3C4.4) g for B-12, 284 (187C408) g for folate, 26 (7.2C86) IU for vitamin D, 639 (391C951) mg for calcium and 9.9 (6.9C13.7) mg for iron. Of all, <10% met the daily intake recommendation (RDA) for folate, vitamin D, iron, and calcium, while <25% and 50% met the recommendation for B-6 and B-12, respectively. B-6 intake was inversely correlated with BMI ( = ?0.15, P < 0.05; Spearman correlation test). Furthermore, B-6, B-12, folate, iron, and calcium intake significantly differed by pre-pregnancy BMI categories (P < 0.05; KruskalWallis test), with obese and overweight women having a lower intake compared to normal or underweight women. CONCLUSIONS: In this subgroup of Chilean pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the inadequacy of micronutrient intake was highly prevalent, especially in women with excess weight; these results need to be confirmed with the complete sample and by including more detailed analyses of both diet and potential confounders but suggest a very concerning nutrition scenario emerging from the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective cohort analysis is to validate and refine our previously described open-source LOT algorithm by comparing the output of the algorithm with results obtained through blinded manual chart review. METHODS: We used structured electronic health record data and clinical documents to identify 500 adult patients treated for metastatic nonCsmall cell lung cancer with systemic anticancer therapy from 2011 to mid-2018; we assigned patients to training (n=350) and test (n=150) cohorts, randomly divided proportional to the overall ratio of simple:complex cases (n=254:246). Simple cases were patients who received one LOT and no maintenance therapy; complex cases were patients who received more than one LOT and/or maintenance therapy. Algorithmic changes were performed using the training cohort data, after which the refined algorithm was evaluated against the test cohort. RESULTS: For simple cases, 16 instances of discordance between the LOT algorithm and chart review prerefinement were reduced to 8 instances postrefinement; in the test cohort, there was no discordance between algorithm and chart review. For complex cases, algorithm refinement reduced the discordance from 68 to 62 instances, with 37 instances in the test cohort. The percentage agreement between LOT algorithm output and chart review for patients who received one LOT was 89% prerefinement, 93% postrefinement, and 93% for the test cohort, whereas the likelihood of precise matching between algorithm output and chart review decreased with an increasing number of unique regimens. Several areas of discordance that arose from differing definitions of LOTs and maintenance therapy could not be objectively resolved because of a lack of precise definitions in the medical literature.

It is unclear whether these subjects should be tested in the absence of symptoms and if those can guide diagnosis. Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, 2020, to March 31, 2020, were collected. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then applied. Findings Positive tests were 138 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (20.2%, 95%CI: 16.7-24.1) and asymptomatic (3.7%, 95%CI: 2.7-5.1) subjects (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (10.6%, 95%CI: 8.3-13.4) whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (2.9%, 95%CI: 0.8-7.3). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 29.7) and fever (OR = 7.21). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 23 days (95%CI: 19-24). Interpretation In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 the presence of symptoms, especially taste and smell alterations and fever, was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDI(vol)), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDI(vol), DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and responsible for a large proportion of mortality in children and the elderly.

Receptors and host factors are two determinants important for virus entry and establishment of infection in vivo. The identification and understanding of viral receptors and host factors can help us to gain insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. Herein, we reviewed receptors and host factors that have been reported thus far. RSV could bind to CX3C chemokine receptor 1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans via the G protein, and to nucleolin, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, epidermal growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 via the F protein. Seven host restriction factors and 13 host factors essential for RSV infection were reviewed.

Such ratings would allow clinicians to assess response to treatment, recovery time and prognosis, nursing burden and staffing needs, and to provide nuanced, appropriate patient-centered care. Given the lack of existing tools, we defined content domains for a new delirium severity instrument for use in individuals with mild to moderate ADRD, the DEL-S-AD. METHODS We built upon our previous study in which we created a content domain framework to inform development of a general delirium severity instrument, the DEL-S. We engaged a new expert panel to discuss issues of measurement in delirium and dementia and to determine which content domains from the prior framework were useful in characterizing delirium severity in ADRD. We also asked panelists to identify new domains. Our panel included eight interdisciplinary members with expertise in delirium and dementia. Panelists participated in two rounds of review followed by two surveys over 2 months. RESULTS Panelists endorsed the same content domains as for general delirium severity, including Cognitive, Level of Consciousness, Inattention, Psychiatric-Behavioral, Emotional Dysregulation, Psychomotor Features, and Functional; however, they excluded six of the original subdomains which they considered unhelpful in the context of ADRD: cognitive impairment; anxiety; fear/sense of unease; depression; gait/walking; and incontinence. Debated measurement challenges included assessment at one point in time versus over time, accounting for differences in clinical settings, and accurate assessment of symptoms related to delirium versus dementia. CONCLUSIONS By capturing a range of characteristics of delirium severity potentially present in patients with ADRD, a population that may already have attention, functional, and emotional changes at baseline, the DEL-S-AD provides a novel rating tool that will be useful for clinical and research purposes to improve patient care.","output":"Domains of delirium severity in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ayurveda is the study of life through which a delayed, glad and sound life can be achieved Rasayana is certainly one of the approaches to achieve it Rasayana is clarified in every single traditional treatise in incredible subtleties It is an unmistakable branch in Ashtanga Ayurveda and shows its signifi-cance in treatment Makers of Bruhattrayi and Laghutrayi have devoted sepa-rate sections for clarifying Rasayanas Pundits, for example, Acharya Chakra-panidatta, Gangadhara, Yogendranath Sen, Dalhana, Arundatta, have likewise advanced various parts of Rasayana and have presented various features The reason for Ayurveda is the support of Swasthya (wellbeing) and treatment of the Aatura (infected individual) Down to earth utilization of Rasayana at both, the levels help in filling the need Point: The point is to arrange the single Rasayana drugs helpful in Covid-19","output":"Ekal dravya (Single herbal drug) exploit in covid 19 C a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has stalled and rolled back progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ecosystem services (ESs), defined as the contributions of ecosystems to human well-being, underpin the achievement of SDGs To promote SDG achievement in post-pandemic era, we teased out the links between ESs and SDGs while examining the impact of COVID-19 We found that ESs benefited all SDGs, yet man-made pressures led to degradation of ecosystems and their services There is broad consensus that the virus lurks in degraded ecosystems and generates spillover due to human interference The pandemic and global lockdown/restriction disrupted the flow of ESs and altered human ESs demand, threatening the efforts for the SDGs We suggested: 1) to study the association and traceability of ESs-SDGs under the pandemic;2) to prioritize pressing issues such as health care, livelihood, and resource security and in the long run, we should promote human-nature harmony to achieve the SDGs;and 3) to enhance ESs and to promote the SDGs through local community efforts, ESs accounting, and ecosystem restoration This paper provides insights into the importance of ESs to the SDGs and helps to promote the SDG achievement by leveraging ESs contribution after the pandemic","output":"Integrate ecosystem services in socio-economic development to enhance achievement of sustainable development goals in the post-pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information systems are the result of rapidly emerging technological developments because human needs as information users of technology are very strong and rapid.

They occur mainly by two mechanisms: (i) spill and (ii) immersion (hot cauldron) burns. These two patterns differ in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Scalds cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective of this study was to compare accidental spill burns and hot cauldron burns in a hospital setting. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the secondary data of scald cases admitted during the years 2019 and 2020 in a burn-dedicated tertiary care center. Total population sampling was adopted. Data analysis was done partly using SPSS, version-23, and Stata-15. Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test were done appropriately to find associations between different variables. Binary regression analysis was performed taking mortality events as the outcome of interest. Results: Out of 108 scald cases, 43 (39.8%) had hot cauldron burns and 65 (60.2%) had accidental spill burns. Overall mortality was 16 (14.8%), out of which hot cauldron burns and accidental spill burns comprised 12 (75.0%) and 4 (25.0%), respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed the type of scald, age, and Baux score found to be associated with mortality. Every one-year increment in age had a 29% lower odds of occurrence of mortality event (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99, p=0.042). Likewise, every one-point increment in Baux score was associated with 19% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; p<0.001). Conclusions: Accidental spill burn was more common but mortality was significantly higher for hot cauldron burns. The risk of mortality was significantly higher in burn events occurring outside the house, and burns involving back, buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities.","output":"Comparison of accidental pediatric scald burns in a tertiary care center: hot cauldron burns versus accidental spill burns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (CoV) that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, emerged in the Middle East region in 2012. This virus, named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, is phylogenetically related to bat CoVs, but other animal species like dromedary camels may potentially act as intermediate hosts by spreading the virus to humans. Although human to human transmission has been demonstrated, analysis of human MERS clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining, especially when infection control was implemented.

Immunity through vaccination and acquired following recovery from natural infection are the two means to building up population immunity, with vaccination representing the safe pathway. However, measuring the contribution to population immunity from vaccination or natural infection is non-trivial. Historical COVID-19 case counts and vaccine coverage are necessary information but are not sufficient to approximate population immunity. Here, we consider the nuances of measuring each and propose an analytical framework for integrating the necessary data on cumulative vaccinations and natural infections at the state and national level. To guide vaccine roll-out and other aspects of control over the coming months, we recommend analytics that combine vaccine coverage with local (e.g. county-level) history of case reports and adjustment for waning antibodies to establish local estimates of population immunity. To do so, the strategic use of minimally-biased serology surveys integrated with vaccine administration data can improve estimates of the aggregate level of immunity to guide data-driven decisions to re-open safely and prioritize vaccination efforts.","output":"A framework for monitoring population immunity to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actions taken against the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically affected many aspects of human activity, giving us a unique opportunity to study how wildlife responds to the human-induced rapid environmental changes. The wearing of face masks, widely adopted to prevent pathogen transmission, represents a novel element in many parts of the world where wearing a face mask was rare before the COVID-19 outbreak. During September 2020-March 2021, we conducted large-scale multi-species field experiments to evaluate whether face mask-use in public places elicits a behavioural response in birds by comparing their escape and alert responses when approached by a researcher with or without a face mask in four European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Poland) and Israel. We also tested whether these patterns differed between urban and rural sites. We employed Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (with phylogeny and site as random factors) controlling for a suite of covariates and found no association between the face mask-wear and flight initiation distance, alert distance, and fly-away distance, respectively, neither in urban nor in rural birds. However, we found that all three distances were strongly and consistently associated with habitat type and starting distance, with birds showing earlier escape and alert behaviour and longer distances fled when approached in rural than in urban habitats and from longer initial distances. Our results indicate that wearing face masks did not trigger observable changes in antipredator behaviour across the Western Palearctic birds, and our data did not support the role of habituation in explaining this pattern.","output":"Face mask-wear did not affect large-scale patterns in escape and alertness of urban and rural birds during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Greenhalgh T, Jimenez JL, Prather KA, Tufekci Z, Fisman D, Schooley R Ten scientific reasons in support of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lancet 2021;397: 1603C05In this Comment, the conflict of interest statement for David Fisman has been corrected according to what was declared on his ICMJE form to read: DF is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (2019 COVID-19 rapid researching funding OV4-170360), received consulting fees as a legal expert for Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario in August and September, 2020, related to COVID-19 transmission in schools, including the importance of ventilation and masks for kids as source control, and currently serves as a legal expert for the Ontario Nurses Association on their challenge to Ontario Directive 5, which restricts access to N95 masks for health-care workers except during performance of aerosol generating medical procedures  This correction has been made to the online version as of May 13, 2021 ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Department of Error"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused governments to institute measures to curb the spread of the virus.

However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31(st), 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m(2); n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m(2); n = 1464, and >30 kg/m(2); n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m(2) than BMI < 25 kg/m(2), respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) and BMI > 30 kg/m(2) as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m(2), respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006).

Design/methodology/approach: In this essay, I discuss some general observations about education during the pandemic and then provide a perspective to some issues related to educational inequalities and learning from home during the pandemic. The essay is informed by recent media articles and reports of national and international institutions. Findings: This essay makes three claims: Despite high hopes, there is only a little chance schools will change as a consequence of this pandemic without bold and brave shifts in mindset in how that change happens. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the effects of preexisting social and educational inequalities; fixing these would be an important consequence of the pandemic. During school closures, learning from home has been mostly based on the old logic of consuming information and knowledge rather than creating or cocreating new ideas and solutions to real-life problems. Research limitations/implications: This is an essay that offers evidence-informed perspectives to current development in education, and it should not be treated as a research-based article. Originality/value: This essay will contribute to the evolving public conversation and professional debate on the future of school education. It will be part of the series of essays that will support those who are seeking to not just adapt to meet the pandemic but also to step back and consider the medium to longer-term implications.","output":"Will the pandemic change schools?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baystate Healths Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) postponed implementation of Group Medical Visits focused on falls reduction for older adults in Springfield, Massachusetts due to COVID-19 and quickly shifted efforts to participate in Dartmouths Falls Prevention Training Program.

Microfluidic and organ-on-chip technologies offer an opportunity to develop more physiologically relevant and complex in vitro models of the CNS. They can be developed to allow precise cellular patterning and enhanced experimental capabilities to study neuronal function and dysfunction. To improve ease-of-use of the technology and create new opportunities for novel in vitro studies, we introduce a modular platform consisting of multiple, individual microfluidic units that can be combined in several configurations to create bespoke culture environments.

HIH is an inpatient service delivered at home usually by (or on behalf of) hospitals, which aims to substitute for a traditional inpatient stay. It does so by delivering a wide range of hospital treatments to patients at home, or residential aged care, using hospital medical and nursing staff, delivery technologies and venous access, pharmacy, radiology and pathology, and a structured system of on call and governance. OPAT is an outpatient service, usually run through infectious diseases physicians' offices or departments. Most care is delivered in infusion centres and requires patients to travel for their care. Generally, there is no after-hours support. HIH has supplanted the role of OPAT due to improved governance and a wider clinical and severity scope. HIH is accessible from hospital emergency departments or directly from residential aged care facilities. Inpatient capacity has been expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is evidence that both HIH and OPAT can successfully treat their selected patient groups. There are no head-to-head studies, but in observational comparisons there might be more adverse drug events in OPAT. OPAT places a greater onus of care, supervision and travel needs on the patient and family. Where HIH is not available, OPAT may remain an alternative for some patients.

INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic is associated with more than 75 million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide. Greece implemented a nationwide lockdown on March 23, 2020, to control the pandemic wave and prevent reducing morbidity and mortality due to Covid-19. During this period, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) hospitalization in the cardiology department was reduced. In addition, the second pandemic wave also led to a new national lockdown on November 7, 2020, although it was implemented 15 days earlier in the relative regional hospital area due to high viral load. PURPOSE: Our study evaluated the number of hospitalized patients with ACS during the nationwide lockdown period, comparing them with the previous years (period 2018 and 2019). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data recordings regarding ACS (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI) hospitalization rates in the Cardiology department were collected from the hospital\\"s register. Each year\\"s data analysis interval included the periods of the nationwide lockdown of 2020; March 23 to May 3 and October 14 to December 10. Statistical analysis was performed between periodic groups using the chi-square test (IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 23.0). RESULTS: During 2018, the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 81 and consisted of 39,1% of the total hospitalizations in the Cardiology Department. In 2019 the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 62 and consisted the 48,8% of the total hospitalizations, while in 2020, the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 30 and consisted the 27,5% of the total hospitalizations. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,05) regarding ACS event hospitalization rate between the period of lockdown (March to May and October-December 2020) and the COVID-19-free period of the previous year (March to May and October to December 2019). There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) regarding ACS event hospitalization rate between the period of lockdown (March to May and October to December 2020) and the COVID-19-free period of the year 2018 (March to May and October to December). Finally, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) in ACS event hospitalization rate between March to May and October to December regarding the years 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSION: Our results are in compliance with the ESC\\"s comparative survey regarding the observed worldwide reduction of hospitalizations for ACS during the COVID-19 lockdown era, suggesting a potential impact of lockdown in both non-environmental and environmental risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Factors of the relative epidemiological reduction are complexed and puzzled, while morbidity and mortality of ACS remained relatively stable even after the lockdown, so future studies are necessary to further investigate them.","output":"The impact of nationwide lockdown on acute coronary syndromes hospitalization rate in the Western Macedonia regional hospital of Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus causes serious diarrhea in suckling piglets, resulting in huge economic losses in the pig industry. A better understanding of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) pathogenesis and identification of the responsive genes will contribute to controlling PEDV infection. Therefore, screening and identifying PEDV-resistance functional genes and then implementing disease resistance breeding have important scientific significance. This study explores the regulatory roles of the GLP-2 gene in regulating PEDV infection and in repairing the intestinal mucosa damage associated with PEDV infection. The findings may contribute to the identification of resistant genes or genetic markers for disease resistance breeding in pigs. ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects intestinal epithelial cells, destroys the intestinal mucosal barrier and then causes diarrhea in piglets. Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a specific intestinal growth hormone that promotes the repair of damaged intestinal mucosa and improves the intestinal barrier. In this study, we investigated the functions of porcine GLP-2 gene in regulating PEDV infection. The intestinal tissues with damaged intestinal structures caused by PEDV infection were first confirmed and collected. Expression analysis indicated that the GLP-2 gene was expressed in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues, and the mRNA level was significantly down-regulated in jejunum and ileum of piglets with damaged intestinal mucosa. Infection of PEDV to porcine small intestinal epithelial cells in vitro showed that GLP-2 gene was significantly decreased, which was consistent with the expression pattern in intestinal tissues. In addition, we silenced the GLP-2 gene by shRNA interfering and found that the copy numbers of PEDV were remarkably increased in the GLP-2 gene silencing cells. Our findings suggest that the GLP-2 gene was potentially involved in regulating PEDV infection and in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier structure, which could contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of PEDV pathogenesis and provide a theoretical basis for the identification and application of resistant genes in pig selective breeding for porcine epidemic diarrhea.","output":"Analysis of Intestinal Mucosa Integrity and GLP-2 Gene Functions upon Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection in Pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With 194109 cases on 6th September 2020 Indonesia is one of the most infected countries of COVID-19.

Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio &#8804; 0.73 for the primary outcome. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19.

The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. A secondary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, included both seropositivity and self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Results. In total, 459 HCWs were tested. 43/454 (9.47%) had a seropositive sample 1 and 75/423 (17.7%) had a seropositive sample 2. By time of sample 2 collection, 54% of participants had received at least one vaccine dose and seroprevalence was 13% among unvaccinated individuals. Relative to physicians, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other roles were increased (Nurse Practitioner: OR[95%CI] 1.93[0.57,6.53], Physician's Assistant: 1.69[0.38,7.52], Nurse: 2.33[0.94,5.78], Paramedic/EMTs: 3.86[0.78,19.0], other: 1.68[0.58,4.85]). The workplace setting was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p=0.04). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCWs reporting duties in the ICU vs. those working in an ambulatory clinic was elevated: OR[95%CI] 2.17[1.01,4.68]. Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCW increased during our study period which was consistent with community infection rates. HCW role and setting - particularly working in the ICU - is associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence among Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: COVID-19 pandemic is experienced intensely with variants in our country, as in other countries. The presence of cancer in patients is associated with morbidity and mortality in the course of COVID-19 disease. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge, attitude and behavior regarding coronavirus disease in cancer patients. Material and Methods: The questionnaire, consisting of three sections and 25 questions measuring knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of cancer patients about COVID-19, was filled face-to-face by each patient in July 2020. Results: Most of the cancer patients were aware of the symptoms related to COVID-19 and applied the protection methods such as wearing masks, hand washing, and social distance. Participants with higher levels of education had significantly higher knowledge levels. Although half of the patients were worried about continuing cancer treatment during the pandemic process, 70 % of the patients did not think of delaying the treatment;48.7 % of the patients were informed by the oncologists about COVID-19 infection. The majority of patients expressed that they did not receive supportive products during the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of electronic medical records, ED visits, and hospital admissions during Ramadan, Hajj, and all other months over a three-year period on the Hijra calendar (1438-1440) or Gregorian (2016-2019). Primary outcomes were the change in the number of ED visits, hospital admissions, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during Ramadan in comparison to during Hajj and other months. Secondary outcomes included mortality; number of surgeries by specialty; and admissions to cardiac, respiratory, orthopedic, and neurosurgery wards. RESULTS During the three years, ED visits increased during Ramadan by 83.0%, 74.8%, and 40.3%, respectively, when compared to non-Hajj, non-Ramadan months. Hospital admissions rose by 21.05%, 50.96% and 48.22%. Combined ED and in-hospital mortality rose by 15.21%, 21.47%, and 1.39%. While there was a large increase in ICU admissions during Ramadan of 1440 (May 2019), this was not a trend seen in other years. Despite there only being two years of data for comparison, there was a trend towards increased admissions to all specialty wards. There was an average 46.69% increase in admissions to the general surgery ward during Ramadan months compared to other months, a 31.06% increase in admissions to the orthopedic surgery ward, and a 44.05% increase in admissions to the cardiac care unit. CONCLUSIONS Ramadan is associated with a significant increase in the population of Makkah (Mecca), Saudi Arabia. Despite this study only focusing on a three-year period, and some variables with only two years of data available, it demonstrates a significant increase in ED visits, hospital admissions, and mortality during Ramadan compared to non-Hajj/non-Ramadan months. During mass gatherings of this size, it would benefit local and regional hospital systems to devote increased resources to patient care, especially to the ED, to prevent morbidity and mortality.","output":"The Holy Month of Ramadan: Mass-Gathering Event Implications for Hospital Surge Capacity Planning in Saudi Arabia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral healthcare providers work near the face of the patients and are at an increased risk of being infected or transmitting the infection to the patients.

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), methodologies can inform patient care during pregnancy and improve outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched English articles on EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Search terms included ML, AI, pregnancy and informatics. We included research articles and book chapters, excluding conference papers, editorials and notes. RESULTS: We identified 127 distinct studies from our queries that were relevant to our topic and included in the review. We found that supervised learning methods were more popular (n = 69) than unsupervised methods (n = 9). Popular methods included support vector machines (n = 30), artificial neural networks (n = 22), regression analysis (n = 17) and random forests (n = 16). Methods such as DL are beginning to gain traction (n = 13). Common areas within the pregnancy domain where AI and ML methods were used the most include prenatal care (e.g. fetal anomalies, placental functioning) (n = 73); perinatal care, birth and delivery (n = 20); and preterm birth (n = 13). Efforts to translate AI into clinical care include clinical decision support systems (n = 24) and mobile health applications (n = 9). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that ML and AI methods are being employed to optimize pregnancy outcomes, including modern DL methods (n = 13). Future research should focus on less-studied pregnancy domain areas, including postnatal and postpartum care (n = 2).

The disease leads to respiratory problems, systemic disorders, and death. To stop the virus transmission, physical distancing was strongly implemented, including working and school from home (WFH & SFH). The limitation altered daily routines and needs advanced to adapt. Many have felt uncomfortable and this could have triggered anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of significant anxiety symptoms and its association with COVID-19-related situations in an Indonesian context during the initial months of the pandemic. Methods: An online community survey was distributed through social media and communication platforms, mainly WhatsApp, targeting people >18 years old in Indonesia. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (Indonesian Version). Demographical data and information on social situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic were collected. The proportion of clinically significant anxiety symptoms was calculated and the association with demographic and social factors was assessed using chi square test ((2)) and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Results: Out of 1215 subjects that completed the survey, 20.2% (n = 245) exhibited significant anxiety symptoms. Several factors, such as age (AOR = 0.933 CI 95% = 0.907C0.96), sex (AOR = 1.612 CI 95% = 1.097C2.369), medical workers (AOR = 0.209 CI 95% = 0.061C0.721), suspected case of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.786 CI 95% = 1.001C3.186), satisfaction level of family support (AOR = 3.052 CI 95% = 1.883C4.946), and satisfaction level of co-workers (AOR = 2.523 CI 95% = 1.395C4.562), were associated with anxiety. Conclusion: One out of five Indonesian people could have suffered from anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms, and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our approach using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists.

In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic many education organizations closed their doors to contain the spread of infection, providing learning continuity by distance and online delivery OBJECTIVE: To explore the challenges educators faced during emergency remote learning so that others may learn from their experience METHOD: A case study based on the experience of educators compares how education continuity was provided in Bahrain, Iraq, and Russia Personal insights gathered using Zoom, complemented by documentary evidence, explore the 'lived experience' of the emergency changes made to teaching and learning provision RESULTS: Whilst teachers and students were ill-prepared, and there were issues with electricity supply, stable Wi-Fi, and access to equipment, most countries were able to offer students access to learning using a combination of distance education and online learning Benefits accrued were greater familiarity with the use of technology and a revaluing of the importance of social relations in teaching and learning Early indications are that educational inequities may have been widened as a consequence CONCLUSION: The challenges facing the education sector fall into three main categories: crisis management and decision making, infrastructure readiness, and student receptiveness A hybrid approach, which blends face-to-face with online learning, is the way forward in the 'new normal' post-pandemic ? 2020 - IOS Press and the authors All rights reserved","output":"Emergency remote education in Bahrain, Iraq, and Russia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is an important cause of significant systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). In patients with arch vessel involvement, extensive surgical repairs often necessitate prolonged use of CPB and results in extensive inflammatory responses. Cytokines and chemokines released during CPB contribute to the progression of SIRS, increase perioperative complications, and negatively impact surgical outcomes. A cytokine adsorber (HA380) is expected to reduce the level of cytokines during CPB, which may decrease both intraoperative and postoperative inflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate if HA380 is able to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and decrease perioperative complications in ATAAD patients undergoing CPB and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). METHODS This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The study aims to recruit 88 patients with ATAAD and aortic arch involvement who will undergo CPB and DHCA to repair the dissected aorta. Patients will be randomized equally into the CPB/DHCA only group (control group) and the CPB/DHCA + HA380 hemoperfusion group (intervention group), with 44 patients each. Patients in the control group will undergo CPB and DHCA only, while patients in the intervention group will undergo continuous hemoperfusion with HA380, in addition to CPB and DHCA. The primary outcome is a composite of major perioperative complications. The secondary outcomes include related inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and minor perioperative complications. To comprehensively evaluate the effect of hemoperfusion on the perioperative outcomes, we will also determine if there are differences in perioperative all-cause mortality, length of ICU stay, and total hospitalization costs. DISCUSSION In the current trial, hemoperfusion will be applied in patients undergoing CPB and DHCA for repair of the aorta involving the aortic arch. This trial aims to test the safety and efficacy of our hemoperfusion device (HA380) in such settings. Upon completion of the trial, we will determine if HA380 is effective in reducing perioperative proinflammatory cytokine levels. Further, we will also verify if reduction in the proinflammatory cytokine levels, if present, translates to improvement in patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04007484 .

Reported to claimed cases ratios (R/C ratio) were evaluated from monthly notifiable disease cases captured by NIDS and NHICS.

There was an overall increase in R/C ratio from 2010C2017 (0.37 to 0.78). In 22 infectious diseases, there was a correlation between NIDS and NHICS. Moreover, claim-based surveillance showed less fluctuating disease incidence rates than report-based surveillance for specific infectious diseases, such as varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever. However, for infectious diseases with episodic outbreaks or low incidence, it was difficult to assess NHICS usefulness.

Since chiropters or signs of their presence were not found within animal shelters in our study area, we suggest that fecal viruses with high environmental resistance have the highest likelihood for spillover through indirect transmission. In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the batCpig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around.

Among the main ones, we consider the ubiquitous distribution of digital assistants, the rapid progress of machine learning concurrent with the exponential growth of 'personal' Big Data and the incipient interest in developing lifelogs.

The authors explain how AI supports patients throughout a healthcare facility, including diagnosis and treatment recommendations needed to get patients from the point of admission to the point of discharge while maintaining quality, patient safety, and patient/provider satisfaction. AI methods are expected to decrease the burden on physicians, improve the quality of patient care, and decrease overall treatment costs. Current conditions affected by COVID-19 pose new challenges for healthcare management and learning how to apply AI will be important for a broad spectrum of students and mature professionals working in medical informatics.

The secondary objective was to identify the risk association of sex, race, presence of nephritis, and use of various immunomodulators with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data of individuals with lupus with and without COVID-19 between January 2020 to May 2021 was retrieved from the TriNetX. A one-to-one matched COVID-19 positive control was selected using propensity score(PS) matching. We assessed several outcomes, including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, severe COVID, acute kidney injury (AKI), Haemodialysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and sepsis were assessed. RESULTS: We identified 2140 SLE patients with COVID-19, 29,853 SLE without COVID-19 and 732,291controls. Mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was comparable among SLE and controls [RR-1.26; 95%CI-0.85,1.8]. SLE with COVID-19 had a higher risk of hospitalisation [RR-1.28; 95% CI 1.14C1.44], ICU admission [RR-1.35; 95% CI 1.01C1.83], mechanical ventilation [RR- 1.58 95% CI 1.07C2.33], stroke [RR-2.18; 95% CI 1.32,3.60], VTE [RR-2.22; 95% CI 1.57C03.12] and sepsis [RR-1.37; 95% CI 1.06C1.78].Individuals with SLE who contracted COVID-19 had higher mortality, hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, AKI, VTE and sepsis (p < 0.001) compared to SLE without COVID-19. Males with SLE had a higher risk of AKI [RR-2.05; 95% CI 1.27C3.31] than females. Lupus nephritis was associated with higher risk of hospitalisation [RR-1.36; 95% CI 1.05C1.76], AKI [RR-2.32; 95% CI 1.50C3.59] and sepsis [RR-2.07; 95% CI-1.12C3.83]. CONCLUSION: The mortality of individuals with SLE due to COVID-19 is comparable to the general population but with higher risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, stroke, VTE and sepsis.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on prison staff and prisoners in England and Wales is unknown. Testing for COVID-19 both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as for antibodies, to date, has been minimal. The purpose of this paper is to explore the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisons poses philosophical and ethical questions around trust, efficacy and ethicacy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This paper is both descriptive, providing an overview of the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisoners in England and Wales, and conceptual in that it discusses and argues the issues associated with large-scale testing. This paper provides a discussion, using comparative studies, of the issues associated with large-scale testing of prisoners across the prison estate in England and Wales (120 prisons). The issues identified in this paper are contextualised through the lens of COVID-19, but they are equally transferrable to epidemiological studies of any pandemic. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of information about its spread in prisons, at the time of writing this paper, there is a programme of asymptomatic testing of prisoners. However, there remains a paucity of data on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because of the progress with the ongoing testing programme. FINDINGS: The authors argue that the widespread testing of prisoners requires careful consideration of the details regarding who is included in testing, how consent is gained and how tests are administered. This paper outlines and argues the importance of considering the complex nuance of power relationships within the prison system, among prisoner officers, medical staff and prisoners and the detrimental consequences. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The widespread testing of COVID-19 presents ethical and practical challenges. Careful planning is required when considering the ethics of who should be included in COVID-19 testing, how consent will be gained, who and how tests will be administered and very practical challenges around the recording and assigning of COVID-19 test kits inside the prison. The current system for the general population requires scanning of barcodes and registration using a mobile number; these facilities are not permitted inside a prison. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper looks at the issues associated with mass testing of prisoners for COVID-19. According to the authors' knowledge, there has not been any research that looks at the issues of testing either in the UK or internationally. The literature available details countries' responses to the pandemic rather and scientific papers on the development of vaccines. Therefore, this paper is an original review of some of the practicalities that need to be addressed to ensure that testing can be as successful as possible.","output":"Trust, efficacy and ethicacy when testing prisoners for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interactions between the oncogenic retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly characterized. We show here that monocyte-derived DCs form syncytia and are infected upon coculture with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. We examined the role of DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin expressed in DCs, in HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation. DC-SIGN is known to bind with high affinity to various viral envelope glycoproteins, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus, as well as to the cellular receptors ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. After cocultivating DCs and HTLV-1-infected cells, we found that anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were able to decrease the number and size of HTLV-1-induced syncytia. Moreover, expression of the lectin in epithelial-cell lines dramatically enhanced the ability to fuse with HTLV-1-positive cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the envelope (Env) glycoproteins of HIV and other viruses, that of HTLV-1 does not bind directly to DC-SIGN. The facilitating role of the lectin in HTLV-1 syncytium formation is mediated by its interaction with ICAM-2 and ICAM-3, as demonstrated by use of MAbs directed against these adhesion molecules. Altogether, our results indicate that DC-SIGN facilitates HTLV-1 infection and fusion of DCs through an ICAM-dependent mechanism.","output":"DC-SIGN facilitates fusion of dendritic cells with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic caused millions to lose their jobs and, consequently, their employer-sponsored health insurance.

Using a novel national data set with information on ACA-compliant individual insurance plans, we found large increases in Marketplace enrollment in 2020 compared with 2019 but with varying percentage increases and spending risk implications across states. States that did not expand Medicaid had enrollment and spending risk increases. States that expanded Medicaid but did not relax 2020 Marketplace enrollment criteria also had spending risk increases. In contrast, states that expanded Medicaid and relaxed 2020 enrollment criteria experienced enrollment increases without spending risk changes. The findings are reassuring with respect to the ability of Marketplaces to buffer employment shocks, but they also provide cautionary signals that risks and premiums could begin to rise either in the absence of Medicaid expansion or when Marketplace enrollment is constrained.","output":"Growth In ACA-Compliant Marketplace Enrollment And Spending Risk Changes During The COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple Biomarkers have recently been shown to be elevated in COVID-19, a respiratory infection with multi-organ dysfunction; however, information regarding the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers as it relates to disease severity and cardiac injury are inconsistent.

PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43C0.70, p < 0.001). Additionally, BNP levels were also significantly higher in patients who died or were critically ill (WMD 0.45, 95% CI ? 0.21C0.69, p < 0.001).

While respondents considered that all races were susceptible to the signs and symptoms of infection as well as death from COVID-19, they considered mortality would be highest among white people from Europe and the USA. Some respondents (mostly male 33/102, 32.4%) considered COVID-19 to be a disease of whites (30.2%). Conclusion: The WHO has identified women and children in rural communities as vulnerable persons who should be given more attention in the COVID-19 national response programs across Africa; however, our study has found that men in Uganda perceive themselves to be at greater risk and that these contradictory perceptions (including the association of COVID-19 with the white race) suggest an important discrepancy in the communication of who is most vulnerable and why.

The general public construed the pandemic threat as being far away and associated it with foreign practices and behaviours. Social media discourse was initially replete with indifference about the perceived risk. Conflicting views about the possibility of the pandemic spreading to Africa and the complexity of explaining its causes delayed the desired understanding of the reality of the global public health concern. The popular public response to the COVID-19 control discourse is therefore characterised by ambivalence about embracing the pandemic control protocols. Drawing on content and discourse analysis of musical and poetic compositions on COVID-19 by artists in East Africa and shared among WhatsApp users in Kenya, this article describes local perspectives on COVID-19 risk and their health promotion implications. It explores local construction of the meaning of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for effective health promotion. The article considers the spontaneous musical and poetic performances by experienced and amateur artists as local attempts to enhance compliance with the global COVID-19 control protocols and popular participation in local health promotion. The basic premise is that artists creation and sharing of digital COVID-19 lyrics denote their attempt to go beyond the medical logic of health promotion by including broad aspects of a cultural logic of care. This approach would establish an integrated and sustainable health promotion framework to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on local societal wellbeing.","output":"Lyrics and artistic improvisations in health promotion for the COVID-19 pandemic control in East Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AN NCI DESIGNATED CANCER CENTER'S RESPONSE TO REDUCING ED ADMISSIONS DURING COVID-19 M Edie Brucker, MSN, MPH, APRN, AGPCNP-BC, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX;Sadat Charania, MPAS, PA-C, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX;Judy Devlin, MSN, ANP-C, AOCNP?, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX;Angela Bazzell, DNP, FNP-BC, AOCNP?, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX Patients with cancer have poorer outcomes with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) due to weakened immune systems resulting from cancer and cancer treatment, as well as older age and comorbidities In response to COVID-19, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the southwest identified the need to reduce avoidable emergency department (ED) visits for cancer patients to reduce the risk for COVID-19 exposure Oncology practices and cancer centers without a designated oncology urgent care clinic can identify a symptom management area and through a multidisciplinary team, develop training, protocols and clinical pathways to reduce patient ED utilization and increased risk of COVID-19 exposure [ ]oncology fellows were deployed to care for our inpatient oncology patients","output":"Podium Abstracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Increased mortality risk because of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection in adults with native liver disease (LD) and liver transplant (LT) is associated with advanced age and comorbid conditions.

METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21 years (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, P = 0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, P = 0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT.

AIM To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ustekinumab and identify the predictive factors of ustekinumab failure-free persistence in a cohort of anti-TNF refractory CD patients. METHODS We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study including all consecutive CD patients who began subcutaneous ustekinumab and presented a clinical response (defined as a significant improvement of CD-related clinical symptoms assessed by the patient's physician leading to continued ustekinumab) during the first year of treatment. Primary outcome was treatment failure defined as withdrawal of treatment due to loss of response, intolerance or need for surgery. RESULTS Eighty-eight of the 122 (72%) CD patients beginning ustekinumab from March 2011 to December 2014, responded to ustekinumab and were followed up until November 2016. Median time on ustekinumab was 26.6 (13.4-34.4) months. Forty-seven patients (54%) continued ustekinumab with a clinical response and 38 (43%) stopped treatment (32 for failure, five for remission and one for pregnancy). Endoscopic response was observed in 82% of patients with endoscopic evaluation and mucosal healing in 39%. Ustekinumab failure-free persistence rates were 78% at 12 months, 66% at 24 months and 55% at 36 months. No predictive factor of ustekinumab failure-free persistence was identified.

Fusion images of pre- and post-RFA dynamic CT, and pre- and post-RFA Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI were created, using a rigid registration method. The minimal ablative margin measured on fusion imaging was categorized into three groups: (1) tumor protruding outside the ablation zone boundary, (2) ablative margin 0-<5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary, and (3) ablative margin 5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary. The categorization of minimal ablative margins was compared between CT and MR fusion images. RESULTS In 57 (62.0%) HCCs, treatment evaluation was possible both on CT and MR fusion images, and the overall agreement between them for the categorization of minimal ablative margin was good ( coefficient = 0.676, P < 0.01). MR fusion imaging enabled treatment evaluation in a significantly larger number of HCCs than CT fusion imaging (86/92 [93.5%] vs. 62/92 [67.4%], P < 0.05).

We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well. METHODS: We used meteorological, pollen/hay fever and mobility data from the Netherlands. For the reproduction number of COVID-19 (R(t)), we used daily estimates from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health. For all datasets, we selected the overlapping period of COVID-19 and the first allergy season: from February 17, 2020 till September 21, 2020 (n = 218). Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop an environmental prediction model of the R(t) of COVID-19. Next, we studied whether adding mobility trends to an environmental model improved the predictive power. RESULTS: Through stepwise backward multiple linear regression four highly significant (p < 0.01) predictive factors are selected in our combined model: temperature, solar radiation, hay fever incidence, and mobility to indoor recreation locations. Our combined model explains 87.5% of the variance of R(t) of COVID-19 and has a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 374.2, p < 0.00001. This model had a better overall predictive performance than a solely environmental model, which explains 77.3% of the variance of R(t) (F(4, 213) = 181.3, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combined mobility and environmental model can adequately predict the seasonality of COVID-19 in a country with a temperate climate like the Netherlands. In this model higher solar radiation, higher temperature and hay fever are related to lower COVID-19 reproduction, and higher mobility to indoor recreation locations is related to an increased COVID-19 spread.","output":"Environmental factors and mobility predict COVID-19 seasonality in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We provide a comprehensive overview of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a possible candidate for pharmacological approaches to halt inflammatory processes in different pathogenic conditions.

This novel pathogen causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pathogenic condition that reached pandemic proportion and is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: The renin-angiotensin system is a complex, coordinated hormonal cascade that plays a pivotal role in controlling individual cell behaviour and multiple organ functions. ACE2 acts as an endogenous counter-regulator to the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways triggered by ACE through the conversion of Ang II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. We discuss the structure, function and expression of ACE2 in different tissues. We also briefly describe the role of ACE2 as a pivotal driver across a wide spectrum of pathogenic conditions, such as cardiac and renal diseases. Furthermore, we provide the most recent data concerning the possible role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and dictating COVID-19 severity.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: from a vasoactive peptide to the gatekeeper of a global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Several artificial intelligence (AI) models for the detection and prediction of cardiovascular-related diseases, including arrhythmias, diabetes, and sleep apnea, have been reported.

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support or positive airway pressure for ARDS who presented to our tertiary-care center from March through November, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 232 patients who required heated high-flow nasal cannula, continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure were assigned to non-invasive group. The remaining 121 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and were assigned to invasive group. Of the total 353 patients, 32 patients (65.6% males) with a mean age of 63  11 years developed barotrauma in the form of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.

Ninety-six undergraduate students were surveyed about devices used and their perceptions of those devices. In addition, the survey measured students engagement, motivation, procrastination, perceived stress, and self-efficacy. It also asked students to report their current grade as well as how satisfied and isolated they felt in their course. Relationships emerged in predictable ways between course outcomes and individual difference measures. And though laptops were most used for coursework, more smartphone use related to lower feelings of isolation. Lower feelings of isolation then related to higher grades and less stress. Regression analyses confirmed that smartphone use explained unique variance in feelings of isolation, and further revealed that perceived stress consistently predicted all outcomes.

We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to April 1, 2020. Countries selected for analysis were China, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Brazil. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of Italy, Spain, and Iran, which supposedly are in the middle of the outbreak at the time of this writing. As for Brazil, which is still in the so-called exponential growth regime, we used the generalized growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken.

Undernourishment emerged as the leading risk factor accounting for 19% of the cases. The WHO however used the terms undernourishment and undernutrition interchangeably in its computation of PAF. Undernourishment is an indirect model derived estimate of decreased per capita energy availability, while undernutrition is defined by direct anthropometric measurements of nutritional status. Methods: We re- estimated the PAF of undernutrition (instead of undernourishment) in 30 high TB burden countries, using the prevalence of undernutrition (age standardized estimate of BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 in adults for both sexes), and the relative risk (RR) of 3.2. Further, we revised PAF estimates of undernutrition with an RR of 4.49, in light of recent evidence. Findings: Twenty four percent of TB in high burden countries is attributable to undernutrition. The PAF of undernutrition was highest in Asian countries, unlike the PAF of undernourishment that was highest in Africa. The corrected estimate led up to 65% increase in number of cases attributable to undernutrition in Asian countries. More than one-third to nearly half of TB cases in India could be attributable to undernutrition. Interpretation: Estimation of the PAF of TB related to undernutrition is methodologically valid and operationally relevant, rather than PAF related to undernourishment. Addressing undernutrition, the leading driver of TB in high TB burden countries (especially Asia) could enable achievement of END TB milestones of TB incidence for 2025.","output":"Attributable is Preventable: Corrected and revised estimates of population attributable fraction of TB related to undernutrition in 30 high TB burden countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite it being a global pandemic, there is little research examining the clinical features of severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa.

The end point of the study was survival. The study population was dichotomized into survivors and non-survivors group. KaplanCMeier plot was used for survival analyses. The Log-Rank test was employed to compare the survival curves. Predictors of mortality were identified by Cox regression models. The significance level of p value was set at 0.05. RESULTS: 432 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified and only 106 (24.5%) patients with moderate, severe or critical illness (mean age 55.6  13.2 years old, 80.2% were male) were included in this study, of whom 34 (32%) died during their hospitalisation. The main complications of the patients included ARDS in 59/66 (89.4%) patients, coagulopathy in 35/93 (37.6%) patients, acute cardiac injury in 24/98 (24.5%) patients, AKI in 15/74 (20.3%) patients and secondary infection in 12/81 (14.8%) patients. The independent predictors of mortality were found to be age [aHR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10C1.82], AKI stage 3 [aHR 2.51; 95% CI 1.33C6.80], proteinuria [aHR 2.60; 95% CI 1.40C6.42], respiratory rate [aHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.09C1.92] and procalcitonin [aHR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03C1.14].

METHODS: We describe a nonparametric statistical method, originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s, to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City during the late summer and early fall of 2020. RESULTS: During August 15CSeptember 26, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 3.3 days, with 87% of cases reported by 5 days from diagnosis. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we projected COVID-19 incidence during the most recent 3 weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. Applying our delay-corrected estimates to case counts reported as of September 26, we projected a surge in new diagnoses that had already occurred but had yet to be reported. Our projections were consistent with counts of confirmed cases subsequently reported by November 7. CONCLUSION: The projected estimate of recently diagnosed cases could have had an impact on timely policy decisions to tighten social distancing measures.

Sequence analysis of the virus indicates that there is only 20% amino acid (aa) identity with known coronaviruses. Previous studies indicate that proteinCprotein interactions amongst various coronavirus proteins are critical for viral assembly. Yet, little sequence homology between the newly identified SARS-CoV and those previously studied coronaviruses suggests that determination of proteinCprotein interaction and identification of amino acid sequences, responsible for such interaction in SARS-CoV, are necessary for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV replication and rationalization of anti-SARS therapeutic intervention. In this study, we employed mammalian two-hybrid system to investigate possible interactions between SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) and the membrane (M) proteins. We found that interaction of the N and M proteins takes place in vivo and identified that a stretch of amino acids (168C208) in the N protein may be critical for such proteinCprotein interactions. Importantly, the same region has been found to be required for multimerization of the N protein (He et al., 2004) suggesting this region may be crucial in maintaining correct conformation of the N protein for self-interaction and interaction with the M protein.","output":"Characterization of proteinCprotein interactions between the nucleocapsid protein and membrane protein of the SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study is about the detailed analysis of the pandemic Corona Virus 2019 which has rocked the entire world with a maximum impact with its structure, its appearance and nomenclature, Clinical presentation and transmission, diagnostic technique.

Biologically derived mesh is also associated with reduced recurrence. Urinary bladder matrix (UBM), a biologically derived extracellular matrix mesh, has shown clinical success. We wanted to determine the safety and efficacy of LHHR with porcine UBM reinforcement. Methods This retrospective, single-surgeon study reviewed clinical data on patients who underwent LHHR from August 2009 through May 2014, with diaphragmatic reinforcement with porcine UBM mesh. Primary outcomes were (1) recurrence-a >2-cm defect above the diaphragm at 3 months; (2) intra- and postoperative complications; (3) pre- and postoperative esophageal reflux (GERD) or dysphagia; and (4) cessation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Results Sixty-two patients who had LHHR with UBM mesh were studied (mean age, 62 years, 53 women, mean body mass index 32.7 kg/m2) Before surgery 98% had GERD, 19% had dysphagia, and 98% were on PPI. Postoperative UGIS was performed on 66% 3 months after surgery, and 19% had a recurrence of >2 cm; 56% remained on PPI, and 16% (P < .001) remained symptomatic. Dysphagia improved in 75% (P = .05). No intraoperative complications were recorded. One postoperative mortality occurred secondary to an unrelated cardiac event. Conclusions UBM mesh was effective and safe for LHHR.

We exposed Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1)-expressing Huh 7.5 (also known as RLW) cells to an acetaldehyde-generating system (AGS) for 24 h. We then infected (or not) the cells with HIV-1(ADA) then exposed them again to AGS for another 48 h. Lysosome damage was assessed by galectin 3/LAMP1 co-localization and cathepsin leakage. Expression of lysosome biogenesisCtranscription factor, TFEB, was measured by its protein levels and by in situ immunofluorescence. Exposure of cells to both AGS + HIV caused the greatest amount of lysosome leakage and its impaired lysosomal biogenesis, leading to intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, the movement of TFEB from cytosol to the nucleus via microtubules was impaired by AGS exposure. The latter impairment appeared to occur by acetylation of -tubulin. Moreover, ZKSCAN3, a repressor of lysosome gene activation by TFEB, was amplified by AGS. Both these changes contributed to AGS-elicited disruption of lysosome biogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and validate a computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Twelve 4CE sites participated. First we developed an EHR-based severity phenotype consisting of six code classes, and we validated it on patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also piloted an alternative machine-learning approach and compared selected predictors of severity to the 4CE phenotype at one site. RESULTS: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of individual code categories for acuity had high variability - up to 0.65 across sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean AUC 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921), compared to AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) for the machine-learning approach. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with as low as 49% precision and recall compared to chart review. DISCUSSION: We developed a severity phenotype using 6 code classes that proved resilient to coding variability across international institutions. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold-standard outcomes, possibly due to heterogeneous pandemic conditions.

Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses.

Loss of BLM activity leads to Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by extraordinary cancer risk and small stature. Here, we have analyzed the composition of the BLM complex during unperturbed S-phase and identified a direct physical interaction with the Mcm6 subunit of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Using distinct binding sites, BLM interacts with the N-terminal domain of Mcm6 in G1 phase and switches to the C-terminal Cdt1-binding domain of Mcm6 in S-phase, with a third site playing a role for Mcm6 binding after DNA damage. Disruption of Mcm6-binding to BLM in S-phase leads to supra-normal DNA replication speed in unperturbed cells, and the helicase activity of BLM is required for this increased replication speed. Upon disruption of BLM/Mcm6 interaction, repair of replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks is delayed and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. Our findings reveal that BLM not only plays a role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress, but that its physical interaction with Mcm6 is required in unperturbed cells, most notably in S-phase as a negative regulator of replication speed.","output":"A novel cell-cycle-regulated interaction of the Bloom syndrome helicase BLM with Mcm6 controls replication-linked processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 restrictions required a transition of our Soil Science and Forest Soils courses to an online format A pre-transition survey found that ?10% of students enrolled in our courses lacked high-speed internet capable of streaming videos and/or computers compatible with the applications in our Learning Management System (LMS) To ensure that students with limited internet or technology were not left behind, we adopted a low-tech/bandwidth delivery (slides + transcript with LMS-delivered assessments) of all lectures and recitation activities Students could also complete either a low-tech/bandwidth (lab slides + transcripts) or high-tech/bandwidth lab option (delivered via video) Upon completion, students were surveyed to assess preferences and perceptions which are vital in understanding how our approach impacted student motivation, engagement with the material, and overall course satisfaction Despite 90% of the students having access to high-speed internet, ?45% of the students used the low-tech solutions either exclusively or half the time, even when high-tech options (such as video) were available Overall, students felt the low-tech/bandwidth delivery of the lecture (?87%) and recitation (?76%) material was effective Students (?74%) also reported that online delivery of the lab material effectively supported their learning and was an effective replacement for the in-lab learning experience Students preferred in-person to online delivery (63% vs 17%) with 20% undecided Noting the flexibility and organization of the course, 69% of the students felt the online delivery of our courses was more effective than their other courses despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of high-tech delivery Our experience demonstrates one approach to adapting an in-person course to a virtual environment that considers inequities in broadband and technology access Despite being perceived as effective by our students, low-tech options were less preferred than in-person instruction suggesting that, while effective, it was not viewed as equivalent This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"When low and high tech solutions converge: Adapting to teaching soils during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attainment of sexual and reproductive health is regarded as a human rights matter.

One of the way that shift workers combat shift work is by using caffeine or other stimulants. Finding the right balance means that shift workers must adjust their sleep schedule often. The goal of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep that EM residents believe theyre getting based on shift times. Methods: This was an IRB-approved, prospective, observational study wherein EM residents wrote in individual sleep logs their sleep time, caffeine usage, and sleep aids for up to 6 months. 25/34 eligible EM residents completed some of their sleep logs and 14/34 completed their entire sleep log with decreased participation attributed to COVID-19. These logs were blinded to researchers and then compared based on shift (day, evening, night, off, post-nights). Shifts were 8-10 hours long and coded as either day (starting between 6a-10a), evening (starting between 11a-4p), night shift (starting between 9p-12a), post-night (day after night shift), or off. One way ANOVA tests were used to compare sleep and caffeine recorded by shift. Post hoc analysis using Bonferroni correction were performed to determine differences between groups. Results: There were statistical differences between the sleep recorded and caffeine use by emergency medicine residents based on shift. Sleep time was highest during days off while caffeine usage was the lowest. On the contrary, sleep time was lowest after night shifts while caffeine usage was the highest. One way ANOVA for sleep time based on shifts was F (4, 1884)=15.61, p=1.45E-12. There was a significant difference between sleep time on days off (M=464.9, SD=106.6) compared to day shift (M=443.8, SD=90.1), p=0.004, evening shift (M=444.8, SD=89.1), p=0.0003, and night shift (M=398.8, SD=122.2, p=1.92E-13. There were also significant differences between day shift and night shift (p=8.14E-06) and evening shift and night shift (p=3.41E-08). The one way ANOVA for caffeine usage amongst shifts was significant at F (4, 1626)=11.91, p=1.55E-09.

Using historical time series data (1980C2018), we find that semi-endogenous growth theories best explain the evolution of TFP in Sri Lanka. This evidence suggests that R&D is critical to the countrys TFP expansion. We find that, through R&D, EPU has a crucial detrimental impact on TFP growth, although it is short-lived.

This paper traces the cross-country associations between COVID-19 mortality, policy interventions aimed at limiting social contact, and their interactions with institutional and demographic characteristics. We document that, with a lag, more stringent pandemic policies were associated with lower mortality growth rates. The association between stricter pandemic policies and lower future mortality growth is more pronounced in countries with a greater proportion of the elderly population and urban population, greater democratic freedoms, and larger international travel flows. Countries with greater policy stringency in place prior to the first death realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower durations to the first mortality peak. In contrast, countries with higher initial mobility saw higher peak mortality rates in the first phase of the pandemic, and countries with a larger elderly population, a greater share of employees in vulnerable occupations, and a higher level of democracy took longer to reach their peak mortalities. Our results suggest that policy interventions are effective at slowing the geometric pattern of mortality growth, reducing the peak mortality, and shortening the duration to the first peak. We also shed light on the importance of institutional and demographic characteristics in guiding policy-making for future waves of the pandemic.","output":"Accounting for Global COVID-19 Diffusion Patterns, January-April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRCATO_ST_ABSPurposeC_ST_ABSThis study investigates whether graph-based fusion of imaging data with non-imaging EHR data can improve the prediction of disease trajectory for COVID-19 patients, beyond the prediction performance of only imaging or non-imaging EHR data. Materials and MethodsWe present a novel graph-based framework for fine-grained clinical outcome prediction (discharge, ICU admission, or death) that fuses imaging and non-imaging information using a similarity-based graph structure. Node features are represented by image embedding and edges are encoded with clinical or demographic similarity. ResultsOur experiments on data collected from Emory Healthcare network indicate that our fusion modeling scheme performs consistently better than predictive models using only imaging or non-imaging features, with f1-scores of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.66 for discharge from hospital, mortality, and ICU admission, respectively. External validation was performed on data collected from Mayo Clinic. Our scheme highlights known biases in the model prediction such as bias against patients with alcohol abuse history and bias based on insurance status. ConclusionThe study signifies the importance of fusion of multiple data modalities for accurate prediction of clinical trajectory. Proposed graph structure can model relationships between patients based on non-imaging EHR data and graph convolutional networks can fuse this relationship information with imaging data to effectively predict future disease trajectory more effectively than models employing only imaging or non-imaging data. Forecasting clinical events can enable intelligent resource allocation in hospitals. Our graph-based fusion modeling frameworks can be easily extended to other prediction tasks to efficiently combine imaging data with non-imaging clinical data.","output":"Fusion of Imaging and Non-Imaging Data for Disease Trajectory Prediction for COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pressure on acute medical services in the pandemic mandated an assertive emergency department (ED) discharge policy. Given the potential for subsequent deterioration and growing appreciation of complications relating to COVID-19 infection, this follow up study was instigated to provide clinical reassurance that discharged patients had followed a safe clinical course. 199 patients discharged from the ED of our central London hospital were identified over a 20-day period at the height of the pandemic in April 2020. 44 had already reattended ED and 12 had been admitted. At 2-week telephone follow-up, 14 patients were identified who required urgent recall for assessment. At 4-week telephone follow-up, 87 patients were identified with persistent symptoms requiring face to face review. A COVID-19 follow-up clinic was therefore established to provide multi-professional review and diagnostics. 65 patients attended for this assessment.

One of the commonly cited barriers to ultrasound training in UME is faculty time resources. Here, we describe an ultrasound scholarly concentration program (SCP) designed to provide medical students with ultrasound opportunities in clinical and scholarly domains, while reducing the need for extensive faculty resources. METHODS: SCPs at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine have 3 requirements: an elective course, a longitudinal portfolio, and a final scholarly project. Thus, the ultrasound SCP was designed to comprise an introductory clinical elective to ultrasound, development of a longitudinal scan portfolio, and a final scholarly project in ultrasound related research or educational innovation. A review of the literature and search of the top 50 US medical schools by US News & World Report was performed to assess the novelty of the ultrasound SCP. RESULTS: To the best of our knowledge, the ultrasound SCP is the first scholarly concentration, track or pathway offered to medical students in the United States. It is the first description of a student designed and student led curriculum focused on providing meaningful ultrasound opportunities to students without necessitating unavailable faculty resources and educational infrastructure. CONCLUSION: A novel ultrasound SCP is described which has clinical aims to expose students to clinical ultrasound as well as scholarly aims to facilitate ultrasound related research and educational innovation. It is designed to enable students to make ultrasound a defining characteristic of their medical school experience. The SCP relies on motivated student involvement and near-peer teaching in a way that is self-sustaining and self-improving.","output":"Creating an Ultrasound Scholarly Concentration Program for Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pharmaceutical industry is progressing toward the development of more continuous manufacturing techniques. At the same time, the industry is striving toward more process understanding and improved process control, which requires the implementation of process analytical technology tools (PAT). For the purpose of drying biopharmaceuticals, a continuous spin freeze-drying technology for unit doses was developed, which is based on creating thin layers of product by spinning the solution during the freezing step. Drying is performed under vacuum using infrared heaters to provide energy for the sublimation process. This approach reduces drying times by more than 90% compared to conventional batch freeze-drying. In this work, a new methodology is presented using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to study the desorption kinetics during the secondary drying step of the continuous spin freeze-drying process. An inline PLS-based NIR calibration model to predict the residual moisture content of a standard formulation (i.e., 10% sucrose) was constructed and validated. This model was then used to evaluate the effect of different process parameters on the desorption rate. Product temperature, which was controlled by a PID feedback mechanism of the IR heaters, had the highest positive impact on the drying rate during secondary drying. Using a higher cooling rate during spin freezing was found to significantly increase the desorption rate as well. A higher filling volume had a smaller negative effect on the drying rate while the chamber pressure during drying was found to have no significant effect in the range between 10 and 30 Pa.","output":"A NIR-Based Study of Desorption Kinetics during Continuous Spin Freeze-Drying"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) induce reorganization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to facilitate viral replication.

Despite an emphasis on respiratory complications, the evidence of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly growing, which is substantially contributing to morbidity and mortality. The neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may have several pathophysiological underpinnings, which are yet to be explored. Hypothetically, SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (CNS) either by direct mechanisms like neuronal retrograde dissemination and hematogenous dissemination, or via indirect pathways. CNS complications associated with COVID-19 include encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, diffuse leukoencephalopathy, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These may result from different mechanisms, including direct virus infection of the CNS, virus-induced hyper-inflammatory states, and post-infection immune responses. On the other hand, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and myopathy are the outcomes of peripheral nervous system injury. Although the therapeutic potential of certain repurposed drugs has led to their off-label use against COVID-19, such as anti-retroviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir-ritonavir combination), biologics (tocilizumab), antibiotics (azithromycin), antiparasitics (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and corticosteroids (dexamethasone), unfortunately, the associated clinical neuropsychiatric adverse events remains a critical issue. Therefore, COVID-19 represents a major threat to the field of neuropsychiatry, as both the virus and the potential therapies may induce neurologic as well as psychiatric disorders. Notably, potential COVID-19 medications may also interact with the medications of pre-existing neuropsychiatric diseases, thereby further complicating the condition. From this perspective, this review will discuss the possible neurological manifestations and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection with emphasis on the probable underlying neurotropic mechanisms. Additionally, we will highlight the concurrence of COVID-19 treatment-associated neuropsychiatric events and possible clinically relevant drug interactions, to provide a useful framework and help researchers, especially the neurologists in understanding the neurologic facets of the ongoing pandemic to control the morbidity and mortality.","output":"Neurological Consequences of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Concurrence of Treatment-Induced Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events in COVID-19 Patients: Navigating the Uncharted"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Mortality is a key statistic for public health globally, and mortality reduction is a key target of 'End TB' strategy. However, cause of death in relation to tuberculosis (TB) may be controversial, and we aimed to evaluate classification in Australia. METHODS: We surveyed Australian clinicians and public health officers, presenting a variety of scenarios. Respondents were asked to classify each scenario with regards to whether TB was considered causative, contributory or not related to death. RESULTS: Fifty-nine individuals completed the survey. Respondents were experienced TB clinicians and public health officers (median 14 years of TB care experience), with a majority having recently been involved in death certification/classification. In most scenarios, there was substantial variation, particularly where death was related to TB medications, or if an alternative contributing process was recognised, such as cardiovascular complications. Variation in classification was not evidently associated with classification experience. CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in cause of death classification among experienced TB clinicians and public health officers, using representative TB death scenarios.

The majority (71.1%) were moderately to highly concerned about becoming infected with COVID-19 from the patients they treated. Most physicians practiced adequate social distancing. While most of them thought that COVID-19 patients received a high quality of care, they generally perceived a shortage of specialised physicians and personal protective equipment (PPE). The ratings for the quality of care and social distancing practices were significantly associated with the presence or absence of training related to COVID-19.

Network embedding learns the vector representations of nodes, opening the whole machine learning toolbox for a wide variety of applications including link prediction, node labelling or clustering. So far, the application of network embedding for drug repositioning focused on heterogeneous networks. Our approach for drug repositioning is based on multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding. Such method allows the richness and complexity of multiplex and heterogeneous networks to be projected in the same vector space. In other words, multiplex-heterogeneous networks aggregate different multi-omics data in the same network representation.

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

Tanimilast (international non-proprietary name of CHF6001) is a novel, potent and selective inhaled PDE4 inhibitor in advanced clinical development for the treatment of COPD. To begin testing its potential in limiting hyperinflammation and immune dysregulation associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we took advantage of an in vitro model of dendritic cell (DC) activation by SARS-CoV-2 genomic ssRNA (SCV2-RNA). In this context, Tanimilast decreased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IL-6), chemokines (CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10) and of Th1-polarizing cytokines (IL-12, type I IFNs). In contrast to -methasone, a reference steroid anti-inflammatory drug, Tanimilast did not impair the acquisition of the maturation markers CD83, CD86 and MHC-II, nor that of the lymph node homing receptor CCR7. Consistent with this, Tanimilast did not reduce the capability of SCV2-RNA-stimulated DCs to activate CD4(+) T cells but skewed their polarization towards a Th2 phenotype. Both Tanimilast and -methasone blocked the increase of MHC-I molecules in SCV2-RNA-activated DCs and restrained the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. Our results indicate that Tanimilast can modulate the SCV2-RNA-induced pro-inflammatory and Th1-polarizing potential of DCs, crucial regulators of both the inflammatory and immune response. Given also the remarkable safety demonstrated by Tanimilast, up to now, in clinical studies, we propose this inhaled PDE4 inhibitor as a promising immunomodulatory drug in the scenario of COVID-19.","output":"The PDE4 Inhibitor Tanimilast Blunts Proinflammatory Dendritic Cell Activation by SARS-CoV-2 ssRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Will the internet, robotics and artificial intelligence mean a jobless future?

Universal human rights, including the right to share in scientific advancement and its benefits, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a natural phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is a purely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment.

It is a crucial moment, given the large number of infected people in Romania and the fact that these children are a source of transmission of the virus in the community. The refusal or hesitation of the parents/legal guardians, regarding the agreement for the vaccination of the children, determined us to focus on this subject, wishing, based on the questioning of as many parents as possible, to extract the reasons underlying these decisions. Methods: This study is designed to observe the attitudes of parents/legal guardians regarding the refusal, hesitation, or acceptance of vaccination of children. The persons targeted to answer the questionnaire had to meet three conditions: to be at least 21 years old, to have a stable residence in Romania, and to be parents/legal guardians of at least one child under 18 years of age. The questionnaire was applied online to a number of 581 parents/legal guardians, being structured to obtain socio-demographic data and other categories of data that allow us to analyze their views on vaccinating children.

CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 70-year-old man with past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and fatigue for five days duration. Vitaly was stable, except for saturating 88% on the room air. He was alert and oriented on physical exam, lung exam was remarkable for bibasilar rales. He had no focal neurological deficits. Lab Work showed elevated COVID-19 markers. Chest x-ray showed left-sided infiltrates. He was admitted to the respiratory care unit and was started on dexamethasone, remdesevir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and enoxaparin prophylactic dose. His oxygen requirement continued to increase, and on the ninth day, he was placed on a nasal high-flow oxygen device with 60 liters FiO2 of 90%. On the eleventh day, the patient developed right facial droop, aphasia and right-sided weakness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 16. Code stroke was called, and a brain computed tomography scan without contrast revealed cortical infarct in the high left parietal cerebral hemisphere without hemorrhage. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck showed mild narrowing within the middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging, later on, showed left medial frontoparietal infarct in ACA territory. Cardiology workup confirmed no cardiac pathology. The neurology team decided not to start the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) because he was out of the tPA window, and as no large vessel occlusion was found, a thrombectomy was not performed. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 infection is considered a highly coagulable status, especially the severe form of the disease. The pathophysiology behind this is not well understood yet. However, Severe COVID-19 is associated with cytokine activation, which activates endothelial cells and mononuclear cells with expression of tissue factor leading to coagulation cascade activation [2]. It has also been observed that COVID-19 can induce Antiphospholipid antibodies, which might play a role in thrombosis in those patients [3]. Our case confirms that COVID-19 induced acute stroke can occur in multiple territories despite the patient being well anticoagulated. CONCLUSIONS: Acute stroke should be suspected in COVID-19 patients with acute neurological changes even if the patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation. Frequent screening neurological examination can lead to early detection and treatment of acute stroke. REFERENCE #1: Verstrepen, K., Baisier, L. & De Cauwer, H.

RESULTS: We find effects of the holiday period of around 45% of the average district incidence rates in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the 2 weeks after holidays end. Western states tend to experience stronger effects than Eastern states. We also find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a districts population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changed behavior during the holiday season accelerated the pandemic and made it considerably more difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the virus by means of contact tracing. Germanys public health authorities did not prepare adequately for this acceleration.","output":"Fueling the Covid-19 pandemic: summer school holidays and incidence rates in German districts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most destructive effects of Covid-19 in India have not been the result of the disease, but the nature of the government response.

MethodsWe assess the sensitivity and specificity of molecular testing performed on saliva in comparison to NPS using two different POC platforms (DiaSorin Simplexa and Cepheid Xpert(R)). NPS and saliva were collected prospectically from asymptomatic health care workers and mildly symptomatic patients. Moreover, the stability of saliva samples after storage at -80{degrees}C for up to 45 days was tested. ResultsThe obtained results in comparison to NPS demonstrated for both DiaSorin Simplexa and Xpert(R) Xpress a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 90.24%.

In cases where maternal general health conditions impede direct breastfeeding or in cases of separation between mother and baby, health organizations encourage and support expressing milk and safely providing it to the infants. METHODS: A series of 22 case studies of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 infection from March 14th to April 14th, 2020 was conducted. Mothers and newborns were followed for a median period of 1.8 consecutive months. RESULTS: Out of 22 mothers, 20 (90.9%) chose to breastfeed their babies during hospital admission. Timely initiation and skin to skin contact at delivery room was performed in 54.5 and 59.1%, respectively. Eighty two percent of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 were fed with breast milk after 1 month, decreasing to 77% at 1.8 months. Six of 22 (37.5%) mothers with COVID-19 required transitory complementary feeding until exclusive breastfeeding was achieved.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the technological readiness of public libraries to provide telemedicine support and to determine differences in readiness between rural and urban public libraries. Methods: We distributed a survey to members of the Virginia Library Association to evaluate technological readiness of Virginia public libraries to support telemedicine use in their facilities. The survey evaluated availability and speed of fixed broadband internet access, physical equipment, and private space for each library. Results: Respondents from 39 libraries completed the survey, approximately one-third of which were in rural or small urban areas. All respondents reported fixed broadband, at least four computers, and available staff to assist who technology in their libraries. Eighty-five percent of surveyed libraries reported sufficient broadband speed and a private room available to patrons. There were no significant differences between rural and urban status for any of the library characteristics.

Wheezy illness has increasingly been recognised as an important cause of morbidity in African children, but there is little information on the contribution of HRV to this. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HRV as a cause of acute wheezing in South African children. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty children presenting consecutively at a tertiary children's hospital with a wheezing illness from May 2004 to November 2005 were prospectively enrolled. A nasal swab was taken and reverse transcription PCR used to screen the samples for HRV. The presence of human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus and human coronavirus-NL63 was assessed in all samples using PCR-based assays. A general shell vial culture using a pool of monoclonal antibodies was used to detect other common respiratory viruses on 26% of samples. Phylogenetic analysis to determine circulating HRV species was performed on a portion of HRV-positive samples. Categorical characteristics were analysed using Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 128 (58.2%) of children, most (72%) of whom were under 2 years of age. Presenting symptoms between the HRV-positive and negative groups were similar. Most illness was managed with ambulatory therapy, but 45 (35%) were hospitalized for treatment and 3 (2%) were admitted to intensive care. There were no in-hospital deaths. All 3 species of HRV were detected with HRV-C being the most common (52%) followed by HRV-A (37%) and HRV-B (11%). Infection with other respiratory viruses occurred in 20/128 (16%) of HRV-positive children and in 26/92 (28%) of HRV-negative samples. CONCLUSION: HRV may be the commonest viral infection in young South African children with acute wheezing.

We aimed to characterize the impact of disease on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in COPD outpatients. Methods: We conducted a national, cross-sectional study among pulmonologists and general practitioners (GPs). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) was used. Inclusion criteria were a physician's diagnosis of COPD and age &#8805;40 years. Subjects with a history of lung surgery, lung cancer or COPD exacerbation within the last four weeks were excluded. Results: Sixty-seven pulmonologists and 6 GPs enrolled 1175 COPD patients. Two hundred forty-eight of those did not fulfill GOLD criteria for COPD (FEV1/FVC <0.7) and 77 were excluded due to missing data. Finally, 850 patients (62.8% men; mean age 66.2  0.3 (SE) years; mean FEV1%pred. 51.5  0.6 (SE)) were analyzed. Last year, 55.4% reported at least one exacerbation, and 12.7% were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. Mean SGRQ-C total score was 43.1  0.83 (SE) and mean component scores for symptoms, activity and impacts were 55.6, 55.4 and 30.5, respectively. Half of the patients (50.3%) reported not being able to do any sports and 78.7% stated that their respiratory symptoms did not allow them doing anything they would like to do. In patients with less severe COPD (FEV1pred &#8805;50% and non-frequent exacerbations), global health status was overrated, ie, estimated as better by the physician than by the patient, while it was underrated in more severe COPD. Conclusion: In Austria, the burden of disease in COPD outpatients tends to be underestimated in patients with milder airway obstruction and less exacerbations and overestimated in patients with more severe airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations.

We aimed to assess and extend the psychometric properties of the ItchyQoL using classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). METHODS: Item characteristic curves (ICCs) were analysed in order to see whether the response categories are functioning optimally. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on the ItchyQoL prior to and after rescoring of the response categories. We conducted a Rasch analysis on the ItchyQoL with revised response options and assessed the mean fit residuals as well as the assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-one patients with CP from nine European countries completed the 22 items of the ItchyQoL. IRT analysis supported the revision of response options from five to three. This revision was supported by excellent structural validity using CTT. The overall fit to the Rasch model was adequate. Unidimensionality was supported by the ItchyQoL overall scale as well as by the single subscales, however local independence was violated in eight cases.

These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 control measures and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. SETTING: Data for this study were collected between 16-Apr-2020 and 24-May-2020 as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app, Hornet. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index: each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to restrictions, closures, and travel bans. METHODS: We used a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model with Poisson distribution to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. RESULTS: A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included. 38% (3992/10396) reported perceived interruptions to in-person testing, 55% (5178/9335) interruptions to HIV self-testing, 56% (5171/9173) interruptions to PrEP, and 10% (990/9542) interruptions to condom access. For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of perceived access to in-person testing (aPR: 097, 95%CI: [096, 098]), a 6% reduction in access to self-testing (aPR: 094, 95%CI: [093, 095]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 095, 95% CI: [095, 097]). Among those living with HIV, 20% (218/1105) were unable to access their provider; 65% (820/1254) reported being unable to refill their treatment prescription remotely. CONCLUSION: More stringent responses were associated with decreased perceived access to services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to minimize service interruptions to the community of gay men and other MSM during this and future waves of COVID-19.","output":"Perceived interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services associated with COVID-19 for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in 20 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 cause fatal infection in 213 countries accounting for the death of millions of people globally. In the present study, phytochemicals from spices were assessed for their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Structure based virtual screening was performed with 146 phytochemicals from spices using Autodock Vina. Phytochemicals with binding energy &#8805; -8.0 kcal/mol were selected to understand their interaction with MPro. Virtual screening was further validated by performing molecular docking to generate favorable docked poses and the participation of important amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulation for the docked poses was performed to study thermodynamic properties of the protein, ligand and protein-ligand complexes. The finding shows that cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin showed favorable binding affinity values with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The results are comparable in terms of docked poses, important amino acid participation and thermodynamic properties with the standard control drugs remdesivir, benazepril and hydroxychloroquine diphosphate. Prime MM-GBSA was employed for end-point binding energy calculation. Binding to domain I and II of MPro were mediated through the OH, SH, NH2 and non-polar side chain of amino acids. Cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin binds to MPro with many sub sites within the active site with RMSD and RMSF within 4 ?. The results computed using Prime MM-GBSA show that cinnamtannin B2 (-68.54940214 kcal/mol) and cyanin (-62.1902835 kcal/mol) have better binding affinity in comparison to hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (-54.00912412 kcal/mol) and benazepril (-53.70242369 kcal/mol).

We pose and solve several complementary problems. First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics.

SARS-CoV-2 homoplasic mutations are important to characterise, because the evidence for a mutation conferring a fitness advantage is strengthened if this mutation has evolved independently and repeatedly in separate viral lineages. Yet detecting homoplasy is difficult due to insufficient variation between sequences to construct reliable phylogenetic trees. Here, we develop a method to more robustly identify confident homoplasies. We derive a maximum likelihood (ML) tree, with taxa bearing seemingly recurrent mutations dispersed across the tree, and then, for each potentially homoplasic mutation, we derive an alternative tree where the same taxa are constrained to one clade such that the mutation is no longer homoplasic. We then compare how well the two trees fit the sequence data. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 yields only a few instances where the constrained trees have significantly less statistical support than unconstrained tree, suggesting phylogenetics can provide limited support for homoplasy in SARS-CoV-2 and that caution is needed when inferring evidence of convergent evolution from phylogenetic methods in the absence of evidence from other sources.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 convergent evolution cannot be reliably inferred from phylogenetic analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the CT imaging results of patients with COVID-19 who previously received several follow-up visits and to explain the changes in pulmonary inflammation. METHODS: Cases of 15 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed: their epidemiology, clinical history, laboratory tests, and multiple CT chest scans obtained during the disease period were studied. RESULTS: The CT scans of the 15 patients showed different results. Four patients had no abnormal findings in their chest CT scans. The first scan of 1 patient revealed right lower lobe inflammation, while the lesion had been completely absorbed in follow-up. Two patients showed bilateral pulmonary inflammation in the first scan which had been absorbed by follow-up but the last examination showed extensive fibrosis. Two patients had no abnormalities in their first CT scans, while pulmonary inflammation was found in the second scan and this had not been completely absorbed by the last follow-up. One patient had pulmonary interstitial lesions with no evidence of National Cochlear Implant Programme (NCIP) on the first and second CT scans. NCIP was found at the third scan, and pulmonary inflammation was not completely absorbed at the last follow-up. Three patients were in the early stage of inflammation at the first scan, and the lesions were absorbed and repaired at the last follow-up. However, the lesions were not completely absorbed. One patient was in the advanced stage at the first scan, and the last follow-up pulmonary lesions were not completely absorbed. The first CT scan of 1 patient revealed large ground-glass opacity in the lungs involving the inner and middle bands.

Fish are a significant protein source and are associated with variety of traditional recipes. Cyprinid fish are one of the most preferred fish by Isaan villagers for daily consumption because they are accessible and affordable. Consumption of these fish probably causes the persistence of high endemicity of human liver fluke infection, particularly with Opisthorchis viverrini, in northeast Thailand. Because the consumption of raw cyprinid fish is a well-documented risk factor for liver fluke infection, sharing of risky raw fish dishes may influence disease transmission through a community. Social network analysis was used to investigate fish and fish-based meal sharing among household members in Isaan villages in liver fluke endemic areas. The findings from three studies confirmed the persistence of traditional Isaan raw fish consumption and food-sharing practice. Social connections via food sharing among villagers played an important role in liver fluke infection and transmission dynamics as a risk factor.

Although oral antihistamines are recommended for the treatment and pretreatment of LAR associated with SLIT-T, there are no clinical trial data to support this recommendation. Rupatadine is an H1 antihistamine that also inhibits platelet activating factor activity. The objective of this case series is to describe real-world clinical situations in which rupatadine was used to treat or mitigate SLIT-TCrelated LAR. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Five cases are presented by the managing allergist and off-label use of rupatadine is their expert opinion only. Patients in all 5 cases were treated with a SLIT-T (e.g. ragweed, tree, grass, or house dust mites) for the management of allergic rhinitis and experienced bothersome LAR with the first SLIT-T administration. In 3 cases, rupatadine 10 mg was administered for the immediate treatment of LAR (either in-office with the first SLIT-T dose or for subsequent LAR experienced at home) and the symptoms resolved. In 3 cases, pretreatment with other second-generation H1 antihistamines was unable to prevent LAR and the patients discontinued the SLIT-T. In these 3 cases, switching to pretreatment with rupatadine allowed the patients to restart and tolerate SLIT-T treatment with minimal or no LAR. In these patients with an established history of LAR, proactive pretreatment with rupatadine in subsequent seasons or with initiation of a different SLIT-T mitigated the previously experienced LARs. CONCLUSIONS: In the cases presented, treatment with rupatadine resolved LAR associated with SLIT-T treatment and rupatadine pretreatment appeared to mitigate subsequent LAR.

Haptoglobin is a conservative protein synthesized mainly in the liver and lungs and is the subject of research as a potential biomarker of many diseases, including various forms of malignant neoplasms. Haptoglobin has several unique biophysical characteristics. The human  gene is polymorphic, has three structural alleles that control the synthesis of three major phenotypes of haptoglobin: homozygous 1-1 and 2-2, and heterozygous 2-1, determined by a combination of allelic variants that are inherited. Numerous studies indicate that the phenotype of haptoglobin can be used to judge the individual predisposition of a person to various diseases. In addition, Hp undergoes various post-translational modifications (PTMs). These are structural transformations (removal of the signal peptide, cutting off the Pre-Hp precursor molecule into two subunits,  and , limited proteolysis of -chains, formation of disulfide bonds, multimerization), as well as chemical modifications of -chains and glycosylation of the -chain. Glycosylation of the -chain of haptoglobin at four Asn sites is the most important variable PTM that regulates the structure and function of the glycoprotein. The study of modified oligosaccharides of the -chain of Hp has become the main direction in the study of pathological processes, including malignant neoplasms.

While clinically available bona fide autophagy modulators have not been developed yet, it is expected that on-going investigation will lead to the development of authentic autophagy modulators that can be safely administered to patients in the near future and will open a new horizon for treatment of incurable or difficult diseases.","output":"Current Status of Autophagy Enhancers in Metabolic Disorders and Other Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Wide Field Imager (WFI) is one of two scientific instruments onboard the next generation European x-ray observatory ATHENA.

The data rate of the downlink is a bottleneck, which limits the amount of science data that can be transferred. Measurement data of the eRosita satellite which is in operation since mid of 2019 shows that a high radiation background generates parasitic sensor data that adds to the science data. In order to remove the parasitic data from the science data stream onboard, a Risc-V softcore processor implementation in the RTG4 FGPA has been studied. Depending on the observation scenario, the data rate is reduced by a factor of more than 50. Within this article, we describe the WFI onboard processing architecture, the sensor effects on space radiation and the hard- and software architecture of the Risc-V softcore that can be implemented to reduce the data rate on board.

Subjective experiences were reported for each trainee using questionnaires. METHODS: During the first four weeks of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, the objective impact of the pandemic on each trainees surgical caseload exposure was assessed using data from individual trainee logbook profiles in the deanery of the Republic of Ireland. Independent predictor variables included the trainee grade (ST 3 to 8), the individual trainee, the unit that the logbook was reported from, and the year in which the logbook was recorded. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to assess for any statistically significant predictor variables. The subjective experience of each trainee was captured using an electronic questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean number of total procedures per trainee over four weeks was 36.8 (7 to 99; standard deviation (SD) 19.67) in 2018, 40.6 (6 to 81; SD 17.90) in 2019, and 18.3 (3 to 65; SD 11.70) during the pandemic of 2020 (p = 0.043). Significant reductions were noted for all elective indicative procedures, including arthroplasty (p = 0.019), osteotomy (p = 0.045), nerve decompression (p = 0.024) and arthroscopy (p = 0.024). In contrast, none of the nine indicative procedures for trauma were reduced. There was a significant inter-unit difference in the mean number of total cases (p = 0.029) and indicative cases (p = 0.0005) per trainee. We noted that 7.69% (n = 3) of trainees contracted COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of operative cases per trainee has been significantly reduced for four of the 13 indicative procedures, as outlined by the JCST. Reassignment of trainees to high-volume institutions in the future may be a plausible approach to mitigate significant training deficits in those trainees worst impacted by the reduction in operative exposure.","output":"Quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic trainees: a national perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Lipids are stable molecules involved in metabolism and inflammation. We investigated the plasma lipidome for markers of severity and nutritional status in critically ill children. Children with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (n=24) were analyzed at three time points and cross referenced to sedation controls (n = 4) for a total of N=28. Eight of the patients with MODS, needed veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) support to survive. Blood plasma lipid profiles were quantified by nano-electrospray (nESI), direct infusion high resolution/accurate mass spectrometry (MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and compared to nutritional profiles and PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores. PELOD scores were not significantly different between MODS and ECMO cases across time-points (p = 0.66). Lipid profiling provided stratification between sedation controls and all MODS patients for lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) (p-value = 0.004), total phosphatidylserine (PS) (p-value = 0.015), and total ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (p-value = 0.03). Phospholipids in patients needing ECMO were observably closer to sedation controls than other MODS patients. Nutrition intake revealed changes in lipid profiles that corresponded to calorie and protein intake. Lipid measurement in the intensive care environment shows dynamic changes over an 8-day PICU course, suggesting novel indicators for defining critically ill children.","output":"Pediatric Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: Analysis by an Untargeted \\"Shotgun\\" Lipidomic Approach Reveals Low-abundance Plasma Phospholipids and Dynamic Recovery Over 8-Day Period, a Single-Center Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutual aid is the fundamental basis of all human societies, an understanding that is exemplified with striking clarity during times of crises.

This event aims to prepare trainees not only to survive, but also to thrive, encouraging them to feel inspired and enthusiastic about their training journey. It is always well attended and has received consistently excellent feedback. Other deaneries have found it to be a key means of disseminating information not provided through other sources. Since up to 100 trainees were predicted to attend the 2020 event, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge.ObjectivesTo design and run a virtual induction event for new ST1 trainees, whilst maintaining the success and positivity of previous face-to-face events.MethodsAttendees were surveyed in advance to allow the organisers to tailor the event to their needs, worries and interests. The event was discussed with key stakeholders within the relevant deaneries. In accordance with the feedback received, the event was tailored to suit a virtual platform.The induction day was shortened to half a day and individual sessions were limited to maintain momentum and engagement. In light of the current events surrounding Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, it was deemed important to include a new session focused on this topic. Traditionally, the chance to meet other trainees starting at the same Trust was a highlight of the event. Breakout groups were designed to facilitate this virtual meeting. A handbook and YouTube channel were created to complement the day, covering content which could not be included in the live event, and as an additional resource for the year ahead.ResultsThe virtual event received extremely positive feedback. Of 107 new ST1 trainees in the region, approximately 95 (88.8%) attended, and 68 (71.5% attendees) provided feedback. 92.6% of trainees felt more prepared to start training following the event. Trainees scored how prepared they felt before and after the event using a five-point Likert scale, with a mean increase in their score of 1.12 following the event (p<0.01).83.8% felt that the event worked well virtually, particularly highlighting the value of the breakout session, live chat and dedicated Q&A session. They rated the opportunity for networking as the most useful aspect of the event, and fed back that the enthusiasm and preparation by the team facilitated a smooth event. The newly-created resources were also considered relevant and useful.76.5% attendees said they would prefer a face-to-face event. They felt that opportunities for networking were more limited with fewer opportunities for questions.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the transformation of the annual ST1 induction event to a virtual platform. A pre-questionnaire was crucial in identifying needs and concerns of trainees, enabling the event to be tailored accordingly. The networking element was retained through the use of breakout groups, and the enthusiasm of organisers and speakers continued to shine through.

After laryngectomy, the patient's vocal function can be restored in several ways, including the insertion of a tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt. A TE shunt is considered an effective means of restoring speech due to its high efficacy, low requirement for training, and no need for any equipment while speaking. However, complications such as saliva inflow into the trachea, caused by the widening of the shunt opening, have also been reported. Moreover, the optimal treatment for an enlarged fistula has not yet been established. A fistula may also form at sites of hypopharyngeal reconstruction with free jejunal transplantation. Following its formation, the influx of saliva, infections, and pressure exerted by the act of swallowing make a fistula resistant to closure, and most patients require closure surgery using myocutaneous flaps. We encountered a case where an intractable TE fistula formed due to a TE shunt after the patient underwent total pharyngolaryngeal resection for hypopharyngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal reconstruction with a free jejunum flap. Since the optimal method for the TE fistula closure remains uncertain, we attempted to close the fistula according to the fistula closure of the free jejunal transplantation. Failure to close a TE fistula using a myocutaneous flap necessitates a re-closure procedure. However, because the surgical field around the trachea can be limited in such patients, creating an additional myocutaneous flap may not be feasible. In addition to the myocutaneous flap, ventilation control using a conventional intubation tube may further narrow the surgical field during the re-closure surgery. Based on our experience and existing literature, in this article, we summarize several ways of managing TE fistula when the surgical field around the trachea is limited.","output":"Closing an Intractable Tracheoesophageal Fistula Caused by a Tracheoesophageal Shunt Using a Myocutaneous Flap and a Hinged Flap With Skin Graft in a Two-Step Procedure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly virus named after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;it affects the respiratory system of the human and sometimes leads to death The COVID-19 mainly attacks the person with previous lung diseases;the major cause of lung diseases is the exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for a longer duration NO2 is a gaseous air pollutant caused as an outcome of the vehicles, industrial smoke and other combustion processes Exposure of NO2 for long-term leads to the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and sometimes leads to fatality This paper aims to analyze the NO2 level impact in India during pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown The study also examines the relationship between the fatality rate of humans because of exposure to NO2 and COVID-19 Design/methodology/approach - Spatial analysis has been conducted in India based on the mortality rate caused by the COVID-19 using the data obtained through Internet of Medical things Meanwhile, the mortality rate because of the exposure of NO2 has been conducted in India to analyze the relationship Further, NO2 level assessment is carried out using Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite data Moreover, aerosol optical depth analysis has been carried out based on NASA's Earth Observing System data Findings - The results indicate that NO2 level has dropped 20-year low because of the COVID-19 lockdown The results also determine that the mortality rate because of long-time exposure to NO2 is higher than COVID-19 and the mortality rate because of COVID-19 may be a circumlocutory effect owing to the inhalation of NO2 Originality/value - Using the proposed approach, the COVID-19 spread can be identified by knowing the air pollution in major cities The research also identifies that COVID-19 may have an effect because of the inhalation of NO2, which can severe the COVID-19 in the human body","output":"Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) impact on health pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using IoT in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous studies have linked outdoor levels of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), O(3), SO(2), and other air pollutants to significantly higher rates of Covid 19 morbidity and mortality, although the rate in which specific concentrations of pollutants increase Covid 19 morbidity and mortality varies widely by specific country and study.

METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to 17 January 2021 and screened reference lists of included systematic reviews. On the basis of prespecified criteria, we included systematic reviews investigating the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults (aged 18 years) with a psychiatric disorder. Titles and abstracts of 5155 identified records and full texts of 431 selected studies were screened by two independent reviewers, based on predefined eligibility criteria and an a priori developed extraction form, following the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBIS instrument. Data extracted from primary studies were synthesised using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS A total of 32 systematic reviews with 245 unique primary studies were identified and met inclusion criteria. Twelve had low risk of bias.

How orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) penetrate and infect mammalian host cells remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the entry mechanisms of the OBV Germiston (GERV). Viral particles were visualized by cryo-electron microscopy and appeared roughly spherical with an average diameter of 98 nm. Labeling of the virus with fluorescent dyes did not adversely affect its infectivity and allowed the monitoring of single particles in fixed and live cells. Using this approach, we found that endocytic internalization of bound viruses was asynchronous and occurred within 30-40 min. The virus entered Rab5a+ early endosomes and, subsequently, late endosomal vacuoles containing Rab7a but not LAMP-1. Infectious entry did not require proteolytic cleavage, and endosomal acidification was sufficient and necessary for viral fusion. Acid-activated penetration began 15-25 min after initiation of virus internalization and relied on maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes. The optimal pH for viral membrane fusion was slightly below 6.0, and penetration was hampered when the potassium influx was abolished. Overall, our study provides real-time visualization of GERV entry into host cells and demonstrates the importance of late endosomal maturation in facilitating OBV penetration. IMPORTANCE Orthobunyaviruses (OBVs), which include La Crosse, Oropouche, and Schmallenberg viruses, represent a growing threat to humans and domestic animals worldwide. Ideally, preventing OBV spread requires approaches that target early stages of infection, i.e., virus entry. However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which OBVs enter and infect host cells. Here we developed accurate, sensitive tools and assays to investigate the penetration process of the OBV Germiston (GERV). Our data emphasize the central role of the late endosomal maturation in GERV entry, providing a comprehensive overview of the early stages of an OBV infection. Our study also brings a complete toolbox of innovative methods to study each step of the OBV entry program in fixed and living cells, from virus binding and endocytosis to fusion and penetration. The information gained herein lay the foundation for the development of antiviral strategies aiming to block OBV entry.","output":"The Orthobunyavirus Germiston Enters Host Cells from Late Endosomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify people with history of mental health disorders before the COVID-19 pandemic in the Brazilian population and estimate the prevalence of mood swings and the subjective distress of the pandemic among individuals with or without mental health disorders. METHODS: Through an online survey, participants were asked about presence or absence of mental health disorders. In addition, they answered the Brunel Mood Scale and the Impact of Event Scale. The mean percentile of mood swing indicators and psychological impact scores were estimated, and data were analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: 13,248 people participated (70.5% women, mean age 35.4 years, 31.2% with history of mental health disorder). Women and younger people were more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorder. All participants had significant changes in mood due to the pandemic. Anger, depressed mood, mental confusion, and fatigue were higher among individuals with bipolar disorder or with combined disorders. Individuals with mental health disorders had a greater subjective distress, especially the group with bipolar disorder (OR = 4.89 [3.64-6.56]) and combined disorders (OR = 6.89 [5.21-9.10]).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Three hundred and four patients with CCI and COVID-19 were observed, group 1 (n=152) consisted of patients receiving basic therapy and mexidol, group 2 (n=152) received only basic therapy. Mexidol was administered intravenously for 14 days, 500 mg (10 ml) per 400 ml of saline solution, then Mexidol FORTE 250 was administered in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day for 2 months. The state of cognitive functions (MoCA scale), sleep (Spiegel questionnaire), asthenia (MFI-20 scale), and quality of life (SIP questionnaire) were evaluated. Examinations were performed before treatment, 30 and 75 days after start of treatment. RESULTS In group 1, there was a more complete and earlier recovery of the state of cognitive functions (an increase in indicators on the MoCA scale, p<0.01), a regression of asthenia (p<0.05), and normalization of sleep (p<0.01).

The volume of cardiac surgery cases has to comply with the mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. The treatment of Covid-19-positive patients must also be considered. Unfortunately, no scientific evidence is available on this issue. Therefore, this study aimed to offer some consensus-based considerations, derived from available scientific papers, regarding the organization and performance of cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Key recommendations were extracted from recent literature concerning cardiac surgery. RESULTS?? Reducing elective cardiac procedures should be based on frequent clinical assessment of patients on the waiting list (every one or two weeks) and the current local status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Screening tests at admission for every patient are broadly recommended. Where appropriate, alternative treatment methods can be considered, including percutaneous techniques and minimally invasive surgery, if performed by experienced cardiac surgery teams. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence on the strategies to organize cardiac surgery in the Covid-19 pandemic. Most authors agree on reducing elective operations based on patients' clinical condition and the status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Admission screenings and the use of percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches should be preferred to reduce in-hospital stays.","output":"Literature-based considerations regarding organizing and performing cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the possible risks associated to smoking in the spread and complications of Covid-19, em-phasizing in the benefits of quitting smoking.

We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first 30 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find 2 of the seventeen subclusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician-delivered prevention messages affect knowledge and information-seeking behavior of Black and Latinx individuals and whether this differs according to the race/ethnicity of the physician and tailored content. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. (Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04371419; American Economic Association RCT Registry, AEARCTR-0005789). SETTING: United States, 13 May 2020 to 26 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 14 267 self-identified Black or Latinx adults recruited via Lucid survey platform. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 3 video messages regarding COVID-19 that varied by physician race/ethnicity, acknowledgement of racism/inequality, and community perceptions of mask-wearing. MEASUREMENTS: Knowledge gaps (number of errors on 7 facts on COVID-19 symptoms and prevention) and information-seeking behavior (number of Web links demanded out of 10 proposed). RESULTS: 7174 Black (61.3%) and 4520 Latinx (38.7%) participants were included in the analysis. The intervention reduced the knowledge gap incidence from 0.085 to 0.065 (incidence rate ratio, [IRR], 0.737 [95% CI, 0.600 to 0.874]) but did not significantly change information-seeking incidence. For Black participants, messages from race/ethnic-concordant physicians increased information-seeking incidence from 0.329 (for discordant physicians) to 0.357 (IRR, 1.085 [CI, 1.026 to 1.145]). LIMITATIONS: Participants' behavior was not directly observed, outcomes were measured immediately postintervention in May 2020, and online recruitment may not be representative. CONCLUSION: Physician-delivered messages increased knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods for Black and Latinx respondents. The desire for additional information increased with race-concordant messages for Black but not Latinx respondents. Other tailoring of the content did not make a significant difference.

Furthermore, we compared potential determinants of rSO2 and CBF. In 12 patients aged  65 years, NIRS and PET were performed simultaneously: before (T1), early after start (T2), and at the end of hemodialysis (T3). Between T1 and T3, the relative change in frontal rSO2 (rSO2) was -8  9% ( P = 0.001) and -5  11% ( P = 0.08), whereas the relative change in frontal gray matter CBF (CBF) was -11  18% ( P = 0.009) and -12  16% ( P = 0.007) for the left and right hemisphere, respectively. rSO2 and CBF were weakly correlated for the left ( 0.31, P = 0.4), and moderately correlated for the right ( 0.69, P = 0.03) hemisphere. The Bland-Altman plot suggested underestimation of CBF by NIRS. Divergent associations of pH, pCO2 and arterial oxygen content with rSO2 were found compared to corresponding associations with CBF.

Beside the key consideration of the patients interests, small animal veterinarians are often challenged to consider not only clients emotional needs, but also their own personal aspirations to provide quality patient care and to make a good living as a professional. Further, veterinarians have an interest in continuous professional development and the use of the newest treatments, which may influence their decision-making process. Based on published work, we hypothesize the existence of four decision ethics orientations that veterinarians can use to manage potentially conflicting concerns. These are: the patient-focused, the client-empathetic, the client-devolved and the development-oriented decision ethics orientations. We surveyed small animal veterinarians in Austria, Denmark, and the UK using a questionnaire (N = 648), and successfully identified the four decision ethics orientations in all three countries. The patient-focused and client-empathetic decision ethics orientations are salient in all countries, whereas Danish and UK veterinarians are slightly more client-empathetic and client-devolved compared to their Austrian colleagues. Across countries our findings show that experienced and older veterinarians tend to be more client-empathetic. Younger and less experienced professionals are more development-oriented compared to their older and more experienced colleagues. In contrast to other studies investigating ethical issues in small animal practice, we found no evidence that gender plays a decisive role in the tendency towards any decision ethics orientation. We also show that veterinarians with a higher client-empathetic orientation and development-orientation more often discuss the possibility of health insurance with clients who do not have it.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, containing the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), an extensively studied animal coronavirus. Since MHV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same genus, MHV could offer insights relative to SARS-CoV-2 studies. MHV-3 strain causes hepatitis and cellular injury, making MHV-3 infection one of the best models for this debilitating disease. Surrogate coronaviruses have been used for virus resistance and inactivation studies, and although real\\\\life conditions using SARS-CoV-2 should be encouraged, their use needs to be balanced with safety and costs. MHV can be manipulated under BSL2 laboratory conditions, unlike SARS-CoV-2, making it a model for studying the virucidal effects on coronaviruses. In this study, we used the betacoronavirus MHV-3 as a model to investigate the virucidal activity of an air disinfection equipment named STR Solution?, an air sterilizer with patented technology. MHV-3 was dried on different surfaces and exposed at varying distances from the STR Solution? equipment and at different exposure times. The residual infectivity was evaluated using the endpoint method. There was not a significant reduction (mean p-value = 0.4) of the viral titer under STR Solution? exposition. STR Solution? caused a slight decrease of the infectious particles titer (> 1 log(10)) only under the following conditions: polypropylene at 3 m, for 1 and 3 h (1.2 log(10) reduction TCID(50)) and Sus domesticus skin at 0.05 m, for 1 h (1.3 log(10) reduction TCID50), and at 3 m for 1 h (1.2 log(10) reduction TCID(50)).

An alternative and widely discussed public health strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic would have been to 'shield' those most vulnerable to COVID-19 (minimising their contacts with others), while allowing infection to spread among lower risk individuals with the aim of reaching herd immunity. Here we retrospectively explore the effectiveness of this strategy using a stochastic SEIR framework, showing that even under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would have been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk individuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of shielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of deaths compared to perfect shielding.

The study addresses effects on residential energy use and the implications for future energy use models, energy planning, and device energy standards and utility program development. In this study we review changes in residential energy use during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic from four residential communities across Los Angeles covering approximately 6603 households within two microclimate sub regional areas (Los Angeles Basin and San Fernando Valley). Analyses address both absolute and seasonal temperature-corrected energy use changes while assessing estimated changes on energy usage from both temperature-sensitive loads (e.g., air conditioning and electric heating) and non-temperature-sensitive loads (e.g., consumer electronics and major appliance use). An average 5.1% increase in total residential energy use was observed for non-temperature sensitive loads during the pandemic period compared to a 2018C2019 baseline. During mid-spring when shelter in place activity was highest a peak monthly energy use of 20.9% increase was seen compared to a 2018C2019 composite baseline. Considering an average of the top five warmest summer days, a 9.5% increase in energy use was observed for events during summer 2020 compared to summer 2018 (a year with similar magnitude summer high heat events).

Despite the severity of the disorder, there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms and successful treatment. This is in part due to delays in recognising OCD symptoms in young people, particularly if the symptom forms are less common. Once OCD is accurately diagnosed, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment, sometimes in combination with medication, producing good long-term prognosis. It is therefore important to accurately detect OCD in children and young people so that they can be offered timely intervention. Use of the best tools in clinical and research settings improves detection and diagnosis, as well as enabling the tracking of progress through treatment. The aim of this current paper was to review measurement tools for OCD in young people with a focus on the practicalities of using tools in busy child mental health clinical settings. METHOD: To discover what measurement tools are available for OCD in young people, we conducted a pragmatic literature of measurement tools for OCD in young people. We searched PsycINFO, Med-Line and the Cochrane databases for reports relating to the measurement of OCD. Additionally, we sought information from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, the Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC) website and the Children and Young People's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) Programme. We also reviewed large trials and meta-analyses of the treatment of OCD in young people and communicated with relevant researchers/clinicians. RESULTS: Seventeen questionnaire measurement tools, with variable psychometric properties, and four commonly used semistructured clinician administered interview measures were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There are several measurement tools with good psychometric properties that are useful for initial screening/identification of OCD, as well as formal diagnosis, symptom tracking and treatment evaluation. With the availability of brief screens, as well as online diagnostic measures, such tools should not be a burden on clinical practice, but rather a helpful aid to support clinicians' assessment and treatment of OCD.","output":"Measurement Issues: The measurement of obsessive compulsive disorder in children and young people in clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to describe the signalment, clinical signs, laboratory results, culture results, and response to treatment for primary septic peritonitis in cats.

Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA. METHOD: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches-Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning. RESULTS: Our findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Sweden's forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middle-the trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases. CONCLUSION: We show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden).

The QSAR analysis is based on a dataset of sixty-two peptide-type compounds which resulted in the generation of statistically robust and highly predictive multiple models.

This is because higher-order biomolecular interactions, dubbed as protein communities, may be retained in their (near-)native state, in contrast to extensively purifying or artificially overexpressing the proteins of interest. The distinct machine-learning approaches are applied to discover proteinCprotein interactions within cell extracts, reconstruct dedicated biological networks, and report on protein community members from various organisms. Their validation is also important, e.g., by the cross-linking mass spectrometry or cell biology methods. In addition, the cell extracts are amenable to structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), but due to their inherent complexity, sorting structural signatures of protein communities derived by cryo-EM comprises a formidable task. The application of image-processing workflows inspired by machine-learning techniques would provide improvements in distinguishing structural signatures, correlating proteomic and network data to structural signatures and subsequently reconstructed cryo-EM maps, and, ultimately, characterizing unidentified protein communities at high resolution. In this review article, we summarize recent literature in detecting protein communities from native cell extracts and identify the remaining challenges and opportunities.

Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the OAS1 splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.","output":"Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shortly after the 2020 US election, initial evidence on first-generation COVID-19 vaccines showed 70C95% efficacy and minimal risks. Yet, many US adults expressed reluctance. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare persons willing and unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to estimate the effects of vaccination attributes on uptake: proof of vaccination, vaccination setting, effectiveness, duration of immunity, and risk of severe side effects. METHOD: Between 9 and 11 November 2020, 1153 US adults completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) on Phase 2 of the CDC Vaccination Program (August 2021). Each of its eight choice tasks had three vaccination alternatives and no vaccination for 6 months. An opt-out inflated logit model was estimated to test for respondent differences and attribute effects. RESULTS: Respondent demographics were unrelated to ones willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75C90% needed for herd immunity.

For COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), survival may be the start of a long road to recovery. Our knowledge of the post-ICU long-term sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may inform our understanding and management of the long-term effects of COVID-19. Source We identified international and Canadian epidemiologic data on ICU admissions for COVID-19, COVID-19 pathophysiology, emerging ICU practice patterns, early reports of long-term outcomes, and federal support programs for survivors and their families. Centred around an illustrating case study, we applied relevant literature from ARDS and SARS to contextualize knowledge within emerging COVID-19 research and extrapolate findings to future long-term outcomes. Principal findings COVID-19 is a multisystem disease with unknown long-term morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology is distinct and unique from ARDS, SARS, and critical illness. Nevertheless, based on initial reports of critical care management for COVID-19 and the varied injurious supportive practices employed in the ICU, patients and families are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome. The distinct incremental risk of COVID-19 multiple organ dysfunction is unknown. The risk of mood disorders in family members may be further exacerbated by imposed isolation and stigma. Conclusion Emerging literature on COVID-19 outcomes suggests some similarities with those of ARDS/SARS and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

In parts of Cambodia and in many other parts of the world, irrigation of rice with groundwater results in arsenic (As) accumulation in soil and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. At times, some As is present as relatively nontoxic, non-regulated, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Low levels of zinc (Zn) have been found in rice from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and China where As levels in rice are high. Furthermore, there have been claims that Zn deficiency is responsible for stunting the growth of children in Cambodia and elsewhere, however in rural Asia, rice is the major source of Zn. Current data are inadequate for both Zn and DMA in Cambodian rice. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of the relationship between the content of Zn and DMA in rice grain in Preak Russey, an area with elevated levels of As in groundwater and to improve the management of Zn deficiency in rice. METHODS. Rice agriculture was evaluated along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total As, and As species in rice and water were conducted by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analysis of total Zn and As in soils and total Zn in rice were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. RESULTS. Rice in Preak Russey had Zn concentrations less than a third the level recommended by the United Nations World Food Programme. There was a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between the Zn content of rice and DMA in rice with the lowest Zn and highest DMA levels occurring near irrigation wells, the source of As.

We report here the biogenesis and topology of the Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) replication complex. Distinct cytopathological changes typical of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aggregation and vesiculation were observed in BBSV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Immunogold labeling of the auxiliary replication protein p23 and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) revealed that the ER-derived membranous spherules provide the site for BBSV replication. Further studies indicated that p23 plays a crucial role in mediating the ER rearrangement. Three-dimensional electron tomographic analysis revealed the formation of multiple ER-originated vesicle packets. Each vesicle packet enclosed a few to hundreds of independent spherules that were invaginations of the ER membranes into the lumen. Strikingly, these vesicle packets were connected to each other via tubules, a rearrangement event that is rare among other virus-induced membrane reorganizations. Fibrillar contents within the spherules were also reconstructed by electron tomography, which showed diverse structures. Our results provide the first, to our knowledge, three-dimensional ultrastructural analysis of membrane-bound VRCs of a plant (+)RNA virus and should help to achieve a better mechanistic understanding of the organization and microenvironment of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes. IMPORTANCE Assembly of virus replication complexes for all known positive-strand RNA viruses depends on the extensive remodeling of host intracellular membranes. Beet black scorch virus, a necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae, invaginates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to form spherules in infected cells. Double-stranded RNAs, the viral replication intermediate, and the viral auxiliary replication protein p23 are all localized within such viral spherules, indicating that these are the sites for generating progeny viral RNAs. Furthermore, the BBSV p23 protein could to some extent reorganize the ER when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana. Electron tomographic analysis resolves the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of such spherules, which are connected to the cytoplasm via a neck-like structure. Strikingly, different numbers of spherules are enclosed in ER-originated vesicle packets that are connected to each other via tubule-like structures. Our results have significant implications for further understanding the mechanisms underlying the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.","output":"Morphogenesis of Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane-Invaginated Vesicles during Beet Black Scorch Virus Infection: Role of Auxiliary Replication Protein and New Implications of Three-Dimensional Architecture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Many countries are struggling with the covid-19 pandemic.

Methods: We queried the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and VigiBase to retrieve cases of MP in which the influenza vaccine and ICIs were recorded as suspect and were concomitantly reported. For the included cases, causality assessment and Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) algorithms were applied. Results: There were 191 and 399 reports of MP with the influenza vaccine that were retrieved (VAERS and VigiBase, respectively). No case of MP reporting the concomitant use of ICIs and the influenza vaccine was found in VAERS, while three cases of myocarditis were retrieved in VigiBase. All of the cases were unclassifiable for a causality assessment because of the lack of data concerning latency. According to the DIPS, one report was categorized as possible and two as doubtful. Conclusion: The paucity of cases coupled with the doubtful causality assessment make the potential interaction between influenza vaccines and ICIs in cancer patients negligible from clinical and epidemiological standpoints. These findings support the cardiovascular safety of the influenza vaccination, which remains strongly recommended in cancer patients, especially in the current COVID-19 era.","output":"Influenza Vaccination and Myo-Pericarditis in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Investigating the Likelihood of Interaction through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and VigiBase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to examine the effect of quarantine caused by COVID-19 on people's mental health and social trust.

We questioned whether the PneuX low-volume fold-free cuff design would prevent cuff leakage and maintain the same tracheal wall pressure as high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) cuffs. METHODS We evaluated 4 HVLP-cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs), Hi-Lo (polyvinyl chloride [PVC]), Microcuff (polyurethane [PU]), SealGuard (PU + tapered), and TaperGuard (PVC + tapered), and the PneuX with its dedicated tracheal seal monitor. In Part 1, we determined tracheal wall pressure using each cuff's capacity to support water columns across recommended intracuff pressures. In Part 2, we evaluated the tracheal seal monitor function at recommended settings. In Part 3, we compared leakage volumes of all ETTs during 30 min of simulated mechanical ventilation or during 8 h if no leak occurred. Parts 1 and 3 were performed with/without lubrication and PEEP. RESULTS In Part 1, PneuX cuffs exerted an average tracheal wall pressure of 27.4  2.4 cm H2O at the recommended intracuff pressure of approximately 80 cm H2O. Tracheal wall pressure did not differ among HVLP cuffs (19.6  1.4 to 29.5  1.4 cm H2O). In Part 2, preinflation intracuff pressure affected the time to obtain tracheal seal monitor pressure attainment (P < .01). The tracheal seal monitor generated average calculated tracheal wall pressure of 33.4  1.2 cm H2O. In Part 3, PneuX ETT showed no leak across 8 h for all trials. Overall, leakage volume was lower with PU (P < .01) and PneuX (P < .01) than with PVC cuffs, regardless of shape, and lower with lubrication and/or PEEP (all P < .01). In each HVLP cuff, lubrication alone eliminated leak at an intracuff pressure of 30 cm H2O. CONCLUSIONS The PneuX cuff generally exerted acceptable tracheal wall pressure, but the tracheal wall pressure monitor allowed pressures exceeding 30 cm H2O in some trials and was the only ETT to prevent leak in all tests. For HVLP cuffs, leak was reduced by PU and PEEP and eliminated by lubrication.","output":"Performance of the PneuX System: A Bench Study Comparison With 4 Other Endotracheal Tube Cuffs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence outbreak caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received significant attention on the global risks Due to its important role in viral replication, the main protease 3CLpro is an important target for drug discovery and development to combat COVID-19 In this work, the structural and dynamic behaviors as well as binding efficiency of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 11a, 13b, and 14b) recently co-crystalized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were studied and compared using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvated interaction energy-based binding free energy (Gbind) calculations The per-residue decomposition free energy results suggested that the key residues involved in inhibitors binding were H41, M49, L141CC145, H163CE166, P168, and Q189CT190 in the domains I and II The van der Waals interaction yielded the main energy contribution stabilizing all the focused inhibitors Besides, their hydrogen bond formations with F140, G143, C145, H164, E166, and Q189 residues in the substrate-binding pocket were also essential for strengthening the molecular complexation The predicted binding affinity of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors agreed with the reported experimental data, and the 13b showed the most efficient binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro From rational drug design strategies based on 13b, the polar moieties (e g , benzamide) and the bulky N-terminal protecting groups (e g , thiazole) should be introduced to P1 and P4 sites in order to enhance H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions, respectively We hope that the obtained structural and energetic information could be beneficial for developing novel SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors with higher inhibitory potency to combat COVID-19","output":"Computational study on peptidomimetic inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) was a non-interventional, multicenter, safety substudy that assessed the long-term safety of everolimus in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) receiving everolimus for its licensed indications in the European Union (EU). This substudy also aimed to address TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND), sexual development, and male infertility. Eligible patients were enrolled from 39 sites across 11 countries in the EU. Outcomes of interest included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-related AEs (TRAEs), AEs leading to everolimus discontinuation, AEs of special interest (AESIs), the observed relationship between everolimus blood levels and incidence of AESIs, TAND, and reproductive clinical features. Herein, we present the final analysis results from this substudy (data cutoff date: 22 January 2020). At data cutoff, 179 patients were enrolled (female, 59.2%; age 18 years, 65.9%), of which the majority completed the study (76%). Overall, 121 patients (67.6%) had AEs regardless of causality. The most frequent TRAEs (5%) were stomatitis (7.8%), aphthous ulcer (6.7%), and hypercholesterolemia (6.1%). The most common treatment-related SAEs (>1%) were pneumonia (3.4%), influenza, pyelonephritis, aphthous ulcer, stomatitis, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia (1.1% each). Ten patients (5.6%) reported AEs leading to everolimus discontinuation. The common psychiatric disorders (N = 179) were autism spectrum disorder (21.8%), anxiety disorder (12.8%), other psychiatric disorders (8.9%), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depressive disorder (7.8% each). Of 179 patients, 88 (49.2%) had 1 behavioral problem. Of these (n = 88), the most common (>20%) were sleep difficulties (47.7%), anxiety (43.2%), mood swings (37.5%), depression mood (35.2%), impulsivity (30.7%), severe aggression (23.9%), and overactivity (22.7%).

Among other roles, it contributes to energy homeostasis and provides insulation for internal organs. Adipocytes were previously thought to be a passive store of excess calories, however this view evolved to include an endocrine role. Adipose tissue was shown to synthesize and secrete adipokines that are pertinent to glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as inflammation. Importantly, the obesity-induced adipose tissue expansion stimulates a plethora of signals capable of triggering an inflammatory response. These inflammatory manifestations of obese AT have been linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, and proposed to evoke obesity-induced comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). A growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic disorders, characterized by AT inflammation and accumulation around organs may eventually induce organ dysfunction through a direct local mechanism. Interestingly, perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT), surrounding the kidney, influences renal function and metabolism. In this regard, PRAT emerged as an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is even correlated with CVD. Here, we review the available evidence on the impact of PRAT alteration in different metabolic states on the renal and cardiovascular function.

The scene is set to understand ideologies of triviality and irrelevance and their impact on justice service delivery in subordinate courts where legal representation and offender participation are the exception. To speculate on novel influences of triviality and irrelevance through machine-learned automation, an audit of Singapores present-day court technologies and its increasingly digitised court processes and format is detailed in the second part. The administrative benefits of digitisation notwithstanding, the paper reasons that digitalisation motivated by convenience, cost-cutting and emergency exigencies presents additional dangers to justice access and due process delivery above those already at play.

A survey of interventional pain physicians published in 2016 reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, often considered the most taxing aspect of burnout. Job dissatisfaction appeared to be the leading agent in the development of burnout in pain medicine physicians in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the entire health care workforce and interventional pain management, with other surgical specialties, has been affected significantly. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed several physical and emotional stressors on interventional pain management physicians and this may lead to increased physician burnout. OBJECTIVE To assess the presence of burnout specific to COVID-19 pandemic among practicing interventional pain physicians. METHODS American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) administered a 32 question survey to their members by contacting them via commercially available online marketing company platform. The survey was completed on www.constantcontact.com. RESULTS Of 179 surveys sent, 100 responses were obtained. The data from the survey demonstrated that 98% of physician practices were affected by COVID and 91% of physicians felt it had a significant financial impact. Sixty seven percent of the physicians responded that in-house billing was responsible for their increased level of burnout, whereas 73% responded that electronic medical records (EMRs) were one of the causes. Overall, 78% were very concerned. Almost all respondents have been affected with a reduction in interventional procedures. 60% had a negative opinion about the future of their practice, whereas 66% were negative about the entire health care industry. LIMITATIONS The survey included only a small number of member physicians. Consequently, it may not be generalized for other specialties or even pain medicine. However, it does represent the sentiment and present status of interventional pain management.

Ten of 16 biomarkers of inflammation were elevated in plasma from POTS patients compared to non-POTS subjects, with most of the differences extremely significant, with p values < 0.0001. Of particular interest were elevations of IL-1 and IL-18 and decreased or normal levels of type 1 interferons in POTS patients, suggesting that the etiology of POTS might be autoinflammatory. All POTS patients had -SPD. With a growing body of evidence that POTS is an autoimmune disease and having elevations of the innate immune system, our results suggest a potential T-cell-mediated autoimmunity in POTS characteristic of a mixed-pattern inflammatory disease similar to rheumatoid arthritis.","output":"Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency and Elevated Inflammatory Biomarkers Are Prevalent in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses exploit the host cell division cycle to favour their own growth. Here we demonstrated that porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is a major causative agent of an emerging and important swine disease complex, PCV2-associated diseases, caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through degradation of cyclin D1 and E followed by reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation in synchronized PCV2-infected cells dependent upon virus replication. This induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest promoted PCV2 replication as evidenced by increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in the synchronized PCV2-infected cells. To delineate a mechanism of miRNAs in regulating PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we determined expression levels of some relevant miRNAs and found that only miR-15a but not miR-16, miR-21, and miR-34a was significantly changed in the PCV2-infected cells. We further demonstrated that upregulation of miR-15a promoted PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via mediating cyclins D1 and E degradation, in which involves PCV2 growth. These results reveal that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favourable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production and that miR-15a is implicated in PCV2-induced cell cycle control, thereby contributing to efficient viral replication.","output":"Involvement of miR-15a in G0/G1 Phase Cell Cycle Arrest Induced by Porcine Circovirus Type 2 Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose critical challenges in achieving Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.

Clinically, impairing irritability is a significant public health problem. There is a need for mechanism-based psychotherapies targeting severe irritability as it manifests in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This study protocol describes a randomised multiple baseline design testing the preliminary efficacy of a new treatment, exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe irritability in youth, which also integrates components of parent management training. We will investigate associations of this intervention with primary clinical measures, as well as ecological momentary assessment measures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Forty youth will be enrolled. Participants, aged 8C17 years, must present at least one of two core symptoms of DMDD: abnormal mood or increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, with severe impairment in one domain (home, school, peers) and moderate in another, or moderate impairment in at least two domains. Each participant is randomised to a 2-week, 4-week or 6-week baseline observation period, followed by 12 active treatment sessions. Clinical ratings are conducted at baseline, biweekly (clinician), weekly (parent/child) throughout treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up (clinician). Clinician ratings on the Affective Reactivity Index and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale for DMDD are our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures include parent and child reports of irritability. Post hoc additional symptom measures include clinician, parent and self-ratings of depression, anxiety and overall functional impairment. Prospective, digitally based event sampling of symptoms is acquired for a week pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Based on our pathophysiological model of irritability implicating frustrative non-reward, aberrant threat processing and instrumental learning, we probe these three brain-based targets using functional MRI paradigms to assess target engagement.

It has affected dermatology practice to a great extent. Since most of the consultations (except emergencies) in dermatology are deferred as a precautionary measure, dermatologists have taken the route of virtual appointments in order to continue treating patients in the present lockdown state. However, the concept of telemedicine is quite new for doctors as well as for patients in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was circulated among Indian dermatologists which included participant demographics, changes in their practice and teaching during COVID-19, use of virtual or e-health technologies, and attitudes/opinions on their experiences. We also wanted to understand doctor perspectives on their own roles, wellness, and hospital responses to the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 260 responses from qualified dermatologists of different parts of India were received between 1(st) and 8(th) April 2020 and were analyzed. Two-thirds of the respondents were within 10 years of starting practice. Virtual consultations have increased by almost three-fold during the pandemic, which is a major change noticed in the practice when we compare before and during the pandemic. Earlier the focus of teledermatology (TD) was mainly for follow-up care (85%), whereas during the pandemic, both new and follow-up patients were provided virtual consultations. The number of patients coming to them for a consultation has drastically reduced. Only 2% of the responders are still performing minor procedures with proper care. Almost two-thirds do not have systems in place to train their residents and fellows due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. The rest of them have started to take the virtual route of teaching through webinars, virtual rounds, and providing access to online journals to continue their teaching. Only 18.6% of dermatologists at work were provided with personal protective equipment. TD has opened new doors to virtual consultation and it was evident that 54.4% of doctors are willing to continue it in the future even after the pandemic is over. CONCLUSION: TD platforms hold great promise to improve access to high-quality dermatologic care in the future. Results from this survey of Indian dermatologists suggest that TD is the future of dermatology as it will be accessed by patients in remote areas and it is a cost-effective move for the patients.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Dermatology Practice in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cet article rpond ? un dsir de modifier les systmes conomiques et sociaux actuels en consequence du COVID-19.

We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February to 20 December 2020 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: : We included 67 primary studies and 22 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 67 primary studies, 53 (79%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 12 (18%) report cycle threshold values and 18 (127%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational and of low quality. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 36 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 42 studies conducted in-hospital that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 24 (57%) reported positive results for SARs-CoV-2 (142 positives out of 1,403 samples: average 10.1%, range 0% to 100%). There was no pattern between the type of hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU) and RT-PCR positivity. Seventeen studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community, of which seven performed RT-PCR sampling, and two studies reported weak positive RNA samples for 2 or more genes (5 of 125 samples positive: average 4.0%). Ten studies attempted viral culture with no serial passage. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected intermittently in the air in various settings.

Evidence indicates that primary and tertiary prevention and improved treatment of somatic conditions in patients with SMI could reduce this excess mortality. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the feasibility of a coordinated co-produced care program (SOFIA model, a Danish acronym for Severe Mental Illness and Physical Health in General Practice) in the general practice setting to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with severe mental illness. METHODS: The SOFIA pilot trial is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial targeting general practices in two regions in Denmark. We aim to include 12 practices, each of which is instructed to recruit up to 15 community-dwelling patients aged 18 and older with SMI. Practices will be randomized by a computer in a ratio of 2:1 to deliver a coordinated care program or usual care during a 6-month study period. A randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization. The coordinated care program includes educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff, which covers clinical and diagnostic management and focus on patient-centered care of this patient group, after which general practitioners will provide a prolonged consultation focusing on individual needs and preferences of the patient with SMI and a follow-up plan if indicated. The outcomes will be parameters of the feasibility of the intervention and trial methods and will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Assessments of the outcome parameters will be administered at baseline, throughout, and at end of the study period. DISCUSSION: If necessary the intervention will be revised based on results from this study. If delivery of the intervention, either in its current form or after revision, is considered feasible, a future, definitive trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing mortality and improving quality of life in patients with SMI can take place.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. The special dinucleotide regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified in this study may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Dinucleotide repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: evolutionary implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is a major cause of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. Here, we examined the neuroprotective action of the A3 adenosine receptor agonist N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methylcarboxamide (IB-MECA) on white matter lesions following CCI. METHODS A CCI mouse model was established using unilateral common carotid artery occlusion. IB-MECA and 3-propyl-6-ethyl-5-[(ethylthio)carbonyl]-2 phenyl-4-propyl-3-pyridine carboxylate (MRS1523), an antagonist of the A3 adenosine receptor, were administered by intraperitoneal injection. The inhibitory avoidance test was used to examine changes in memory performance. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and neurofilament were assessed by immunohistochemistry, while expressions of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), ERK, interferon-beta (IFN-), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were assessed by western blot assay. RESULTS The memory retention score was reduced in vehicle-treated mice compared with IB-MECA-treated (p < 0.05) mice. Compared to sham-operated mice, p-ERK, GFAP and IFN- were increased, while MAP-2 and neurofilament were reduced in vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01 for each). IB-MECA reduced ERK phosphorylation (p < 0.01) and GFAP expression (p < 0.05), but upregulated MAP-2 and IFN- (p < 0.01 for both), compared with vehicle. MRS1523 suppressed the effects of IB-MECA on the memory deficit, ERK phosphorylation, and on MAP-2, neurofilament, GFAP and IFN- levels. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that A3 adenosine receptor stimulation ameliorates CCI-induced memory deficits, modulates the ERK signaling pathway, preserves MAP-2 and neurofilament expression, regulates GFAP expression, and upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine IFN-. Thus, the A3 adenosine receptor may be a therapeutic target for treatment of cognitive disorders and cerebral inflammatory diseases.","output":"A3 adenosine receptor agonist IB-MECA reverses chronic cerebral ischemia-induced inhibitory avoidance memory deficit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus crisis has caused a complicated situation at a sanitary, economic and social levels, that requires of a fundamental work in communication area so that the society comprise and collaborate with the adopted measures Through the review and synthesis of the scientific and reference literature, the present paper contrasts lessons learnt in previous public health crisis against the communication implemented from the institutional voices and from the press coverage during the first stages of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain This paper detects that the absence of an early announcement (or overtaking of the negative stage) and the control messages in a context of uncertainty caused a brusque transition to the following stage of the crisis, coincident with an explosion of the number of contagions, what generated fear The spokesperson formula applied is against all recommendations of crisis communication Regarding the journalistic coverage, examples of alarmism and sensationalism news arised The numeric data have been the resource more valuable and the computer graphics the multimedia content more developed Since the pandemic is still on course, it is recommended the learning and the adjustment of the communication and information to the citizens in the following stages of this crisis or in future crisis taking into account the group of first lessons presented here","output":"Communication and coronavirus crisis in Spain.

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. OBJECTIVE: Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-&#954;B2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. METHODS: We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. RESULTS: This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses.

However, the phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics of this variant remain unclear. An analysis of the 131 Omicron variant sequences from November 9 to November 28, 2021 reveals that variants have diverged into at least 6 major subgroups. 86.3% of the cases have an insertion at amino acid 214 (INS214EPE) of the spike protein. Neutrality analysis of DH (-2.814, p<0.001) and Zeng E (0.0583, p=1.0) tests suggested that directional selection was the major driving force of Omicron variant evolution. The synonymous (Dsyn) and nonsynonymous (Dnonsyn) polymorphisms of the Omicron variant spike gene were estimated with Tajima D statistic to eliminate homogenous effects. Both D ratio (Dnonsyn/Dsyn, 1.57) and  (Dsyn-Dnonsyn, 0.63) indicate that purifying selection operates at present. The low nucleotide diversity (0.00008) and Tajima D value (-2.709, p<0.001) also confirms that Omicron variants had already spread in human population for more than the 6 weeks than has been reported.

Barotrauma is a well-documented complication of mechanical ventilation. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, characteristics, and management of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 who developed barotrauma. METHODS: Retrospective case series study of 13 adult, mechanically ventilated, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted between 3/15/2020 and 4/14/2020 to a community hospital in New York City. Patient demographics, clinical course, ventilatory parameters, and radiographic results were obtained from electronic medical records. Barotrauma was defined as pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and or pneumothorax on chest X-ray. Descriptive analyses and Mann-Whitney U test were performed, where appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 574 COVID-19 positive patients, 139 (24.2%) needed mechanical ventilation and 13 (9.4%) of those developed barotrauma. Majority of patients were Black race (92.3%), older than age 65 (56.8%), male (69.2%), and had comorbidities (76.9%). Most common presenting symptoms were cough (84.6%) and dyspnea (76.9%). Barotrauma presentations included 3/13 pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum, 12/13 pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, and 1/13 pneumothorax alone. The average days on ventilator was 3.4, average positive expiratory-end pressure 15.5 cmH2O, dynamic compliance 33.8 mL/cmH2O, and P/F ratio 165. Interventions were 4/13 chest tubes and 2/13 pigtail catheters. CONCLUSIONS: Barotrauma is a common complication of mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients. Despite high ventilatory pressures, tension pneumothorax is rare and barotrauma could potentially be managed conservatively. Further studies are needed to evaluate the indication and outcome of thoracostomies and conservative management.","output":"Pulmonary barotrauma in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already resulted in a huge setback to mankind in terms of millions of deaths, while the unavailability of an appropriate therapeutic strategy has made the scenario much more severe. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.","output":"In silico analyses on the comparative sensing of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA by the intracellular TLRs of humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments have restricted public life during the COVID-19 pandemic, inter alia closing sports facilities and gyms.

Among the various micro-/nanoparticle production technologies, emulsion-based particle formation is the most widely used because of its unique advantages such as uniform generation of spherical small particles and higher encapsulation efficiency (EE). For this emulsion-based micro-/nanoparticle technology, one of the most important factors is the extraction efficiency associated with the fast removal of the organic solvent. In consideration of this, a technology called supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions (SFEE) that uses the unique mass transfer mechanism and solvent power of a supercritical fluid (SCF) has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of several conventional technologies such as solvent evaporation, extraction, and spray drying. This review article presents the main aspects of SFEE technology for the preparation of micro-/nanoparticles by focusing on its pharmaceutical applications, which have been organized and classified according to several types of drug delivery systems and active pharmaceutical ingredients. It was definitely confirmed that SFEE can be applied in a variety of drugs from water-soluble to poorly water-soluble. In addition, it has advantages such as low organic solvent residual, high EE, desirable release control, better particle size control, and agglomeration prevention through efficient and fast solvent removal compared to conventional micro-/nanoparticle technologies. Therefore, this review will be a good resource for determining the applicability of SFEE to obtain better pharmaceutical quality when researchers in related fields want to select a suitable manufacturing process for preparing desired micro-/nanoparticle drug delivery systems containing their active material.","output":"Pharmaceutical Applications of Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Emulsions for Micro-/Nanoparticle Formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics cause chaotic situations in supply chains (SC) around the globe, which can lead towards survivability challenges The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that has severely affected global business dynamics Similar vulnerabilities have been caused by other outbreaks in the past In these terms, prevention strategies against propagating disruptions require vigilant goal conceptualization and roadmaps In this respect, there is a need to explore supply chain operation management strategies to overcome the challenges that emerge due to COVID-19-like situations Therefore, this review is aimed at exploring such challenges and developing strategies for sustainability, and viability perspectives for SCs, through a structured literature review (SLR) approach Moreover, this study investigated the impacts of previous epidemic outbreaks on SCs, to identify the research objectives, methodological approaches, and implications for SCs The study also explored the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the business environment, in terms of effective resource allocation, supply and demand disruptions, and transportation network optimization, through operations management techniques Furthermore, this article structured a framework that emphasizes the integration of Industry 4 0 technologies, resilience strategies, and sustainability to overcome SC challenges during pandemics Finally, future research avenues were identified by including a research agenda for experts and practitioners to develop new pathways to get out of the crisis","output":"Supply Chain Operations Management in Pandemics: A State-of-the-Art Review Inspired by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and health care personnel (HCP) working in these facilities are at high risk for COVID-19-associated mortality.

We set out to investigate if this was also true for injury-related ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP), we looked at 28 years of injury-related ED visits at the Montreal Children's Hospital, a provincially designated Pediatric Trauma Centre. We compared data from a two-month period during the COVID-19 lockdown (16 March to 15 May) to the same period in previous years (1993-2019) to determine whether the 2020 decrease in ED visit numbers was unprecedented (i.e. a similar decrease had never occurred) for different age groups, nature of injuries, mechanisms and severity. RESULTS The 2020 decrease was unprecedented across all age groups between 1993 and 2019. When compared with the 2015 to 2019 average, the decrease was smallest in children aged 2 to 5 years (a 35% decrease), and greatest in the group aged 12 to 17 years (83%). Motor vehicle collisions and sports-related injuries practically vanished during the COVID-19 lockdown. Surprisingly, more children aged 6 to 17 years presented with less urgent injuries during the COVID-19 lockdown than in previous years. CONCLUSION As was the case with SARS in 2003, COVID-19 acted as a deterrent for pediatric ED visits. The lockdown in particular had a profound impact on injury-related visits.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this experimental and cross-sectional study consisted of 52 people working in the communication sector. Data were collected using a questionnaire and the state anxiety inventory. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, variance analysis, KruskalCWallis, MannCWhitney U and Tukeys test. Findings: While the state anxiety scores of the workers working in the communication sector were 47.94  4.90 before the training, they were found to be 43.98  5.20 after the training. Research limitations/implications: As in every study, this study has some limitations. Although a homogeneous sample is tried to be formed since it only covers this group, it should be considered that there is a limitation in terms of generalizability. In addition, the fact that the knowledge score is not measured and the relationship between the knowledge score and the anxiety score is not evaluated should be considered as a limitation. Finally, it is also a limitation that the questionnaire form, which includes measurement tools, is applied online. It is thought that measuring errors can be minimized if questionnaires are applied face to face. Practical implications: The results of the study showed that the training given to the workers in the communication sector contributed positively to the reduction of anxiety levels. It is important to provide training and support to those with high anxiety levels. After providing effective protection for nurses/midwives under pandemic conditions and preventing their uncertainties, they can contribute to the reduction of anxiety levels by providing training to individuals who serve the society. It is recommended to plan health trainings for the anxiety of other sector workers serving the society and to focus on these groups. Thus, the effective protection of individuals and their service quality will increase and their anxiety may decrease. Originality/value: Informative support from nurses/midwives can make it easier to control anxiety arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are important in order to draw attention to the anxiety of other sector workers serving the society and the importance of informative roles of nurses. In order to reduce the anxiety levels of workers in different sectors, it is recommended to conduct more supportive training activities and to draw attention to the workers serving the society. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The effect of COVID-19 prevention methods training given through distance learning on state anxiety level: the case of private sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 acts as a serious challenge to the whole world.

Quantitative results demonstrated that the application of RAVEL intensity normalization prior to running FreeSurfer significantly impacted both FreeSurfer volume and cortical thickness outcome measures. Visual assessment demonstrated that the application of RAVEL significantly improved FreeSurfer hippocampal segmentation accuracy. The RAVEL intensity normalization had little impact on PET SUVR measures.","output":"Statistical Methods for Processing Neuroimaging Data from Two Different Sites with a Down Syndrome Population Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2013, an emerging infectious disease emerged in China, 132 cases of human were infected with the H7N9 avian influenza virus, 39 cases were resulted in death within 3 month, which sparked a global concern about public health.

In this study, we evaluated the duration of protection and immune response in sea bass given a single dose of a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine. Examinations included experimental challenge with nervous necrosis virus (NNV), serological assays for NNV-specific antibody reactivity, and immune gene expression analysis. VLP-vaccinated fish showed high and superior survival in challenge both 3 and 7.5 months (1800 and 4500 ) post-vaccination (RPS 87 and 88, OR (surviving) = 16.5 and 31.5, respectively, p < 0.01). Although not providing sterile immunity, VLP vaccination seemed to control the viral infection, as indicated by low prevalence of virus in the VLP-vaccinated survivors. High titers of neutralizing and specific antibodies were produced in VLP-vaccinated fish and persisted for at least ~9 months post-vaccination as well as after challenge. However, failure of immune sera to protect recipient fish in a passive immunization trial suggested that other immune mechanisms were important for protection. Accordingly, gene expression analysis revealed that VLP-vaccination induced a mechanistically broad immune response including upregulation of both innate and adaptive humoral and cellular components (mx, isg12, mhc I, mhc II, igm, and igt). No clinical side effects of the VLP vaccination at either tissue or performance levels were observed.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing all patients completing &#8805; 1 Pl-OC cycle from 2016 to 2018 at a large single-center OC program. Subjects were categorized by age at retrieval and number of cycles. We extrapolated age-based oocyte thresholds for 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR from previously published data. We calculated the proportion of subjects overall, and for each age group, whose number of frozen oocytes was greater than or equal to their age-based threshold for a 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR after 1 and 2 cycles. OR for 60% eLBR with one cycle was calculated for age and AMH cutoff values and corroborated with logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1241 subjects, completing 1799 Pl-OC cycles, were included. With one cycle, 66% (819/1241) achieved &#8805; 50% eLBR and 51% (634/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. With two cycles, 79.6% (988/1241) attained &#8805; 50% eLBR and 65.5% (813/1241) achieved 70% eLBR.

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of the mothers and neonates were recorded. The presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG, and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood, and infant blood, together with feeding patterns, was assessed within 1 month after delivery. Feeding patterns and maternal psychological status were also recorded in the second follow-up. Results: No positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 was found in neonates. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM for SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with IgM presence in the maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All infants were in a healthy condition in two follow-ups, and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. The rate of breast milk feeding increased during two follow-ups. All mothers receiving a second follow-up experienced negative psychological factors and status.

The theoretical starting point is ICZM requires decision support tools to cope with knowledge from multiple sources, interdisciplinarity and multiple scales (e.g., spatial, temporal or organizational) [1]. The 2007 Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union [2] is a key document to understand the relationship between coastal and marine information and policy implementation. It shows that it is necessary to develop a marine-coastal Decision Support System [3, 4] based on indicators and indices (aggregations of indicators into a synthetic representation), use of Geographic Information Systems, models and multicriteria assessment of scenarios [5, 6]. The system of indices is used to describe the complexity of a coastal system: geo-ecological level, land processes, human society, economy, and coastal uses at multiple scales [5, 7]. Multicriteria assessment is a tool to support social and environmental decisions in the perspective of sustainability and strategic planning [8C11].

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to analyze and potentially classify or predict the behavior of biological systems based on such characterization. As ML applications are extremely data-intensive, given the relative sparsity of biomedical data sets ML training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) often require the use of synthetic training data. Agent-based models (ABMs) that incorporate known biological mechanisms and their associated stochastic properties are a potential means of generating synthetic data. Herein we present an example of ML used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) as a surrogate system used to predict the time evolution of an ABM focusing on the clinical condition of sepsis. Methods: The disease trajectories for clinical sepsis, in terms of temporal cytokine and phenotypic dynamics, can be interpreted as a random dynamical system. The Innate Immune Response Agent-based Model (IIRABM) is a well-established model that utilizes known cellular and molecular rules to simulate disease trajectories corresponding to clinical sepsis. We have utilized two distinct neural network architectures, Long Short-Term Memory and Multi-Layer Perceptron, to take a time sequence of five measurements of eleven IIRABM simulated serum cytokine concentrations as input and to return both the future cytokine trajectories as well as an aggregate metric representing the patient's state of health. Results: The ANNs predicted model trajectories with the expected amount of error, due to stochasticity in the simulation, and recognizing that the mapping from a specific cytokine profile to a state-of-health is not unique. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, generated predictions with a more accurate forecasted trajectory cone. Discussion: This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of ANNs to predict disease progression in sepsis as represented by an ABM. The findings demonstrate that multicellular systems with intrinsic stochasticity can be approximated with an ANN, but that forecasting a specific trajectory of the system requires sequential updating of the system state to provide a rolling forecast horizon.","output":"The Use of Artificial Neural Networks to Forecast the Behavior of Agent-Based Models of Pathophysiology: An Example Utilizing an Agent-Based Model of Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the situation of the Covid-19 plague, many organizations are raising funds to help local governments to obtain additional sources of funds that will be distributed to those in need Trust is an important factor for the parties involved in raising these funds, both in terms of the funder, the service provider of fundraising platform and even the fundraiser On this occasion, the author tries to analyze how to implement blockchain technology and smart contracts in the dominant schemes of crowdfunding process the results of this study indicate that blockchain-based smart contracts can be applied to the dominant schemes of crowdfunding process ? 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering All rights reserved","output":"Smart contract and blockchain for crowdfunding platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiologic and syndromic surveillance metrics traditionally used by public health departments can be enhanced to better predict hospitalization for coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Here, a cost-effective, nontoxic, and metal-free strategy is reported for the surface engineering of laser-induced graphene (LIG). The authors covalently engineer the surface potential of the LIG from -14 to +35 mV (LIG+ ), enabling both high-efficiency antimicrobial and antiviral performance under mild conditions. Specifically, several candidate microorganisms of different types, including Escherichia coli, Streptomyces tenebrarius, and Candida albicans, are almost completely inactivated after 10-min solar irradiation. LIG+ also exhibits a strong antiviral effect against human coronaviruses: 99% HCoV-OC43 and 100% HCoV-229E inactivation are achieved after 20-min treatment. Such enhancement may also be observed against other types of pathogens that are heat-sensitive and oppositely charged.

The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low.

Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway.","output":"The Natural Compound Notopterol Binds and Targets JAK2/3 to Ameliorate Inflammation and Arthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense RNA coronavirus that constitutes a new threat for the global community and economy While vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being developed, the mechanisms through which this virus takes control of an infected cell to replicate remains poorly understood Upon infection, viruses completely rely on host cell molecular machinery to survive and replicate To escape from the immune response and proliferate, viruses strategically modulate cellular metabolism and alter subcellular organelle architecture and functions One way they do this is by modulating the structure and function of mitochondria, a critical cellular metabolic hub but also a key platform for the regulation of cellular immunity This versatile nature of mitochondria defends host cells from viruses through several mechanisms including cellular apoptosis, ROS signaling, MAVS activation and mitochondrial DNA-dependent immune activation These events are regulated by mitochondrial dynamics, a process by which mitochondria alter their structure (including their length and connectivity) in response to stress or other cues It is therefore not surprising that viruses, including coronaviruses hijack these processes for their survival In this review, we highlight how positive sense RNA viruses modulate mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism to evade mitochondrial mediated immune response in order to proliferate","output":"Mitochondria Targeted Viral Replication and Survival StrategiesProspective on SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior research has examined consumer willingness to fly in a variety of situations, including during disease outbreaks.

The data were collected in two stages in order to both develop a descriptive regression equation and a predictive model. RESULTS: Regression equations were created for both business and pleasure travel, and the following predictors were significant for both scenarios: perceived threat from COVID-19, agreeableness, affect, and fear.

Our aim was to explore whether the pandemic had any impact on patients presenting with cervicofacial infections (CFI) of odontogenic origin to the secondary care and their management. METHODS: Comparative analysis was carried out evaluating prospective and retrospective consecutively admitted patients with a diagnosis of CFI of odontogenic origin in the COVID-19 lockdown period from 15(th) March to 15(th) June 2020 and pre COVID-19 during the same period of the previous year. Data included patient demographics, co-morbidities, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) status on admission, clinical features, prior treatment in primary care, source of referral, SARS-CoV-2 antigen status, treatment received in secondary care, intra-operative findings, and whether escalation of the level of care was required. RESULTS: Across both cohorts there were one hundred and twenty-five (125) patients admitted with CFI of odontogenic origin, with a 33% reduction ((n = 75 (2019) vs. n = 50 (2020)) in number of patients admitted during COVID-19 lockdown. There was no difference between the cohorts in terms of age (p = 0.192), gender (p = 0.609) or major co-morbidities (p = 0.654). Proportionally more patients in the COVID-19 group presented with SIRS (p = 0.004). This group of patients persisted with symptoms for longer before presenting to secondary care (p = 0.003), more delay from hospital admission to surgical intervention (p < 0.005) and had longer length of hospital stay (p = 0.001). More patients required extra-oral surgical drainage during COVID-19 (p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 lockdown has had adverse effects on the presentation of CFI of odontogenic origin and its management within a Regional Acute Maxillofacial Service.

There is also limited understanding of the pathogenesis of NE in the RT and the RM. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted comparative analyses of patients with NE in the RT and the RM. Clinical symptoms were more severe in patients with NE from the RM with longer observed duration of fever symptoms and hospitalization. Analysis of patient sera showed changes in the levels of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in patients with NE from both the RT and the RM, suggesting leukocyte activation, extracellular matrix degradation, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Interestingly, levels of several cytokines were distinctly different between patients NE from the RT when compared with those from the RM. These differences were not related to the genetic variation of orthohantaviruses circulating in those regions, as sequence analysis showed that Puumala virus (PUUV) was the causative agent of NE in these regions. Additionally, only the Russia (RUS) genetic lineage of PUUV was detected in the serum samples of patients with NE from both the RT and the RM.

METHODS: Retrospective case series in the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium of confirmed COVID-19 patients 'after surviving an ICU-stay', 'aged &#8805; 70 years', or 'aged < 70 years with a length of hospitalization > 7 days'. Exclusion criteria were 'unwilling to cooperate', 'medically unstable', or 'palliative care policy'. Following tests were used: 'Five Times Sit To Stand Test', 'hand grip dynamometry', 'Barthel index', 'Swallowing screening', 'Montreal Cognitive Assessment', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale', and 'Nutritional Risk Screening 2002'. RESULTS: One or more tests were obtained in 135/163 patients (83.3%). Physical impairments were present in 43.2-82.8% of the patients. Median BI was 10/20 indicating limited self-dependency. Swallow impairments were present in 3/53 (5.7%) and 24/76 (31.6%) had risk of malnutrition. Impaired memory was seen in 26/43 (60.5%) and 22/47 (46.8%) had elevated anxiety/depression scores.

The studies were limited to publicly available literature for passengers starting in January 2020; studies on other persons such as flight crews were not reviewed. A novel quantitative approach was developed to estimate air travel transmission risk that considers secondary cases, the overall air travel passenger population, and two correction factors for asymptomatic transmission and underreporting. There were at least 2866 index infectious passengers documented to have passed through the air travel system in a 1.4 billion passenger population. With correction factors, the global risk of transmission during air travel is 1:1.7 million. Uncertainty in the correction factors and a 95% credible interval indicate risk ranges from 1 case for every 712,000 travelers to 1 case for every 8 million travelers.

Similarly, the U.S. also experienced a shortage of healthcare resources, which led to a reduction in the efficiency of the whole healthcare system.

As such, this study aims to assess the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare facilities in the State of Florida. For this purpose, two methods were used: the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA). These methods were applied to identify the high and low access areas in the entire state. Furthermore, a metric, namely the Accessibility Ratio Difference (ARD), was developed to evaluate the spatial access difference between the models. Results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. We also observed that the 2SFCA method overestimates the accessibility in the areas with a lower number of ICU beds due to the \\"equal access\\" assumption of the population within the catchment area.

However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is severely hampered by undesirable metabolic complications, including the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These effects occur due to glucocorticoid receptor activation within multiple tissues, which results in inter-organ crosstalk that increases hepatic glucose production and inhibits peripheral glucose uptake. Despite the high prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia associated with their routine clinical use, treatment protocols for optimal management of the metabolic adverse effects are lacking or underutilized. The type, dose and potency of the glucocorticoid administered dictates the choice of hypoglycaemic intervention (non-insulin or insulin therapy) that should be provided to patients. The longstanding quest to identify dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists to separate the hyperglycaemic complications of glucocorticoids from their therapeutically beneficial anti-inflammatory effects is ongoing, with selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators in clinical testing. Promising areas of preclinical research include new mechanisms to disrupt glucocorticoid signalling in a tissue-selective manner and the identification of novel targets that can selectively dissociate the effects of glucocorticoids.

DESIGN Prospective cohort study - GAZEL cohort. SETTING France. PARTICIPANTS The 13,128 subjects who completed a questionnaire in 2012. MEASUREMENTS According to the Strawbridge questionnaire, subjects were considered frail if they reported difficulties in two domains or more among physical, nutritive, cognitive and sensory domains. The risk of adverse health outcomes was assessed by using logistic regression models (hospitalisations, onset of difficulty in performing movements of everyday life) and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (mortality). RESULTS Mean age was 66.8 +/- 3.4 years and 73.8% were males. The prevalence of frailty varied from 4.4 to 14.2% depending on whether the sensory domain was excluded or included. During follow-up, 182 deaths (1.4%), 479 hospitalisations (3.6%) and 703 cases of new disability (8.0%) were observed. Both definitions of frailty predicted the onset of difficulties to perform everyday movements, with 2 to 3-fold increase in the risk. The inclusion of the sensory domain in the definition made frailty predictive of hospitalisations (Odds Ratio 1.31 [1.01-1.70]) but the association with mortality was only observed when sensory difficulties were ignored (Hazard Ratio 2.28 [1.32-3.92]).

The goal of this short review is to synthesize EMA findings from our research group, which has studied several hundred outpatients during treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD). (We cite pertinent findings from other groups, but have not tried to be comprehensive.) One of our main goals in using EMA is to examine momentary changes in internal states that proximally predict, or concurrently mark, events such as lapses to opioid use. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarize findings evaluating several classes of momentary markers or predictors (craving, stress, negative and positive moods, and physical pain/discomfort) of lapses and other states/behaviors. Craving and some negatively valenced mood states are concurrently and prospectively associated with lapses to opioid use during treatment. Craving is also concurrently and prospectively associated with momentary changes in stress and mood. Convincing evidence has not yet emerged for stress as a robust redictor of lapse to opioid use; it appears to be contributory, but neither necessary nor sufficient. SUMMARY: Ambulatory assessment can capture changes in internal states and drug-related behaviors in situ and at high temporal resolution. We recommend research strategies that may increase the clinical and prognostic utility of ambulatory assessment, including denser sampling (i.e., more assessments per day) and more attention to heterogeneity across people and across populations.","output":"Ambulatory Assessment Methods to Examine Momentary State-Based Predictors of Opioid Use Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a mandatory invasive mechanical ventilator prototype for severe COVID-19 patients with volume and pressure control operation modes.

Moreover, when cases are more than health care providers' capacity, it is important to follow up cases at home. In this paper, we present a complete system that enables healthcare providers to follow up with patients with respiratory-related diseases at home. The aim is to evaluate the use of a mobile phone's accelerometer to capture respiration waveform from different patients using mobile phones. Whereas measurements are performed by patients themselves from home, and not by professional health care personnel, the signals captured by mobile phones are subjected to many unknowns. Therefore, the validity of the signals has to be evaluated first and before any processing. Proper signal processing algorithms can be used to prepare the captured waveform for RR computations. A validity check is considered at different stages using statistical measures and pathophysiological limitations. In this paper, a mobile application is developed to capture the accelerometer signals and send the data to a server at the health care facility. The server has a database of each patient's signals considering patient privacy and security of information. All the validations and signal processing are performed on the server side. The patient's condition can be followed up over a few days and an alarm system may be implemented at the server-side in case of respiration deterioration or when there is a risk of a patient's need for hospitalization. The risk is determined based on respiration signal features extracted from the received respiration signal including RR, and Autoregressive (AR) moving average (ARMA) model parameters of the signal. Results showed that the presented method can be used at a larger scale enabling health care providers to monitor a large number of patients.","output":"Tele-Monitoring System of Risk in Respiratory Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To establish if COVID-19 has worsened outcomes in patients with AO 31 A or B type hip fractures. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed for a five-week period from 20 March 2020 and the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 infection, perioperative pulmonary complications, time to theatre, type of anaesthesia, operation, grade of surgeon, fracture type, postoperative intensive care admission, venous thromboembolism, dislocation, infection rates, and length of stay. RESULTS: In all, 76 patients with hip fractures were identified in each group. All patients had 30-day follow-up. There was no difference in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification or residence at time of injury. However, three in each group were not fit for surgery. No significant difference was found in 30-day mortality; ten patients (13%) in 2019 and 11 patients (14%) in 2020 (p = 0.341). In the 2020 cohort, ten patients tested positive for COVID-19, two (20%) of whom died. There was no significant increase in postoperative pulmonary complications. Median time to theatre was 20 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 16 to 25) in 2019 versus 23 hours (IQR 18 to 30) in 2020 (p = 0.130). Regional anaesthesia increased from 24 (33%) cases in 2019 to 46 (63%) cases in 2020, but ten (14%) required conversion to general anaesthesia. In both groups, 53 (70%) operations were done by trainees. Hemiarthroplasty for 31 B type fractures was the most common operation.

With Wuhan as the center of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, its people have become an object of stigmatization. To provide necessary information for stigma mitigation, this study aims to identify the stigmatizing attitudes towards Wuhan people and trace their changes as the COVID-19 progressed in China by analyzing related posts on social media. Methods: : We collected a total of 19,780 Weibo posts containing the keyword Wuhan people and performed a content analysis to identify stigmatizing attitudes in the posts. Then we divided our observation time into three periods and performed Repeated Measures ANOVA to compare the differences in attitudes in three periods. Results: : Results show that stigma was mild with 2.46% of related posts being stigmatizing. The percentages of stigmatizing posts differed significantly in 3 periods (F (2,66) = 5.60, p <.01, 2= 0.15). The percentages of Infectious posts (F (2,66) = 3.69, p <.05, 2 = 0.10) and Stupid posts (F (2,66) = 3.65, p <.05, 2 = 0.10) are significantly different in 3 periods. The percentages of Irresponsible posts is not significant different in 3 periods (F (2,66) = 0.63, p =.53, 2 = 0.02). After government interventions, stigma didnt reduce significantly, and stigma with Infectious attitude even increased. It was until the government interventions took effect that stigma significantly reduced. Conclusions: : This study found that stigma towards Wuhan people included diverse attitudes and changed at different periods. After government interventions but before they took effect, stigma with Infectious attitude increased. After government interventions took effect, general stigma, and stigma with Infectious and Stupid attitudes decreased. This study constitutes an important endeavor to understand the stigma towards Wuhan people in China during the COVID-19 epidemic.

As the pandemic evolves there is limited understanding of a potential association between symptomatic viral infection and age. To date, there is no knowledge of the role children (prepubescent, ages 9-13 years) play as \\"silent\\" vectors of the virus, with themselves being asymptomatic. Throughout different time frames and geographic locations, the current evidence on COVID-19 suggests that children are becoming infected at a significantly lower rate than other age groups-as low as 1%. Androgens upregulate the protease TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease-2), which facilitates efficient virus-host cell fusion with the epithelium of the lungs, thus increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of severe COVID-19. Owing to low levels of steroid hormones, prepubertal children may have low expression of TMPRSS2, thereby limiting the viral entry into host cells. As the world anticipates a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the role of prepubescent children as vectors transmitting the virus must be interrogated to prepare for a potential resurgence of COVID-19. This review discusses the current evidence on the low incidence of COVID-19 in children and the effect of sex-steroid hormones on SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and clinical outcomes of pediatric patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective institutional review board-approved study included 65 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.3  9 years; mean [SD] body mass index, 24.4 [4.8] kg) who underwent routine CT examinations of the abdomen/pelvis followed immediately by 2 low-dose scans. Raw data sets were reconstructed by using filtered back projection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Measurements of objective noise and CT numbers were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Six subjective image quality parameters were scored. Diagnostic confidence and accuracy in detection of various elementary lesions were performed. RESULTS Objectively, mean image noise for MBIR was significantly superior at all dose levels (P < 0.001). Subjectively, standard-dose ASIR and low-dose MBIR scans were better than standard-dose FBP scan in all parameters assessed (P < 0.05). Low-dose MBIR scans were comparable with standard-dose ASIR scans in all parameters except at noise index of 70 (approximately 85% dose reduction), where, in this case, the detection of liver lesions less than 5 mm were rated inferior (P < 0.05) with diagnostic accuracy reducing to 77.4%. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose MBIR scan shows superior objective noise reduction compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. Subjectively, low-dose MBIR scans at 76% dose reduction were also superior compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. However, at dose reductions of 85%, small liver lesions may be missed.","output":"Image comparative assessment using iterative reconstructions: clinical comparison of low-dose abdominal/pelvic computed tomography between adaptive statistical, model-based iterative reconstructions and traditional filtered back projection in 65 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We formulate three basic assumptions that should ideally guide any well-designed COVID-19 prevalence study.

METHODS: This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. LIMITATIONS: The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months.

Nevertheless, its efficacy in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Thus, the establishment and validation of standardized methods that predict the viral neutralizing (VN) activity of plasma against SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to appraise its therapeutic value. Using an in-house quantitative ELISA test and two independent cohorts with a total of 345 donors, we found that plasma and serum from most convalescent donors contained IgG antibodies specific to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, with varying concentrations which correlate with previous disease severity and gender. Anti-RBD IgG plasma concentration significantly correlated with the plasma/serum VN activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. ABSTRACT: Several hundred millions of people have been diagnosed of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causing millions of deaths and a high socioeconomic burden. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, induces both specific T- and B-cell responses, being antibodies against the virus detected a few days after infection. Passive immunization with hyperimmune plasma from convalescent patients has been proposed as a potentially useful treatment for COVID-19. Using an in-house quantitative ELISA test, we found that plasma from 177 convalescent donors contained IgG antibodies specific to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, although at very different concentrations which correlated with previous disease severity and gender. Anti-RBD IgG plasma concentrations significantly correlated with the plasma viral neutralizing activity (VN) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Similar results were found using an independent cohort of serum from 168 convalescent health workers. These results validate an in-house RBD IgG ELISA test in a large cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and indicate that plasma from all convalescent donors does not contain a high enough amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD neutralizing IgG to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. The use of quantitative anti-RBD IgG detection systems might help to predict the efficacy of the passive immunization using plasma from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Determination of the Concentration of IgG against the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain That Predicts the Viral Neutralizing Activity of Convalescent Plasma and Serum against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: School closures and other public health responses have decreased the extent that children interact with mandated reporters and other professionals trained to detect child maltreatment.

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 raised new concerns about the mental health of HCW workers, which may be affected by new demands and the organization of work. Studies comparing pre-and post-pandemic work environments in health settings are necessary to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on HCWs mental health. Objectives We aimed to investigate the association between occupation stress and depressive symptoms among HCW in a city in northeastern Brazil at the end of 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 355 HCW from a city in northeastern Brazil. Occupational stress, based on the demand-control model, was measured by the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), and depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and to analyse associations of interest. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 > 9) was 22.4%. Occupational stress was strongly associated with the outcome. In the crude analyses, the prevalence of depression symptoms among workers eposed to high job strain was 3.54 (95% CI: 1.60-6.90) times that of those with low strain. After adjustment for sex, age and income, the prevalence ratio remained highly significant (PR=3.34;95%CI: 1.80-6.18). Conclusions Occupational stress was a strong risk factor for depressive symptoms in a pre-pandemic scenario. The prevalence of depressive symptoms is expected to increase during the pandemic.

In our paper, we focus on identifying fake news using its content. The used dataset containing fake and real news was pre-processed using syntactic analysis. Dependency grammar methods were used for the sentences of the dataset and based on them the importance of each word within the sentence was determined. This information about the importance of words in sentences was utilized to create the input vectors for classifications. The paper aims to find out whether it is possible to use the dependency grammar to improve the classification of fake news. We compared these methods with the TfIdf method. The results show that it is possible to use the dependency grammar information with acceptable accuracy for the classification of fake news. An important finding is that the dependency grammar can improve existing techniques. We have improved the traditional TfIdf technique in our experiment.","output":"Improving fake news classification using dependency grammar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People spontaneously divide everyday experience into smaller units (event segmentation). To measure event segmentation, studies typically ask participants to explicitly mark the boundaries between events as they watch a movie (segmentation task). Their data may then be used to infer how others are likely to segment the same movie. However, significant variability in performance across individuals could undermine the ability to generalize across groups, especially as more research moves online. To address this concern, we used several widely employed and novel measures to quantify segmentation agreement across different sized groups (n = 2C32) using data collected on different platforms and movie types (in-lab & commercial film vs. online & everyday activities). All measures captured nonrandom and video-specific boundaries, but with notable between-sample variability. Samples of 6C18 participants were required to reliably detect video-driven segmentation behavior within a single sample. As sample size increased, agreement values improved and eventually stabilized at comparable sample sizes for in-lab & commercial film data and online & everyday activities data. Stabilization occurred at smaller sample sizes when measures reflected (1) agreement between two groups versus agreement between an individual and group, and (2) boundary identification between small (fine-grained) rather than large (coarse-grained) events. These analyses inform the tailoring of sample sizes based on the comparison of interest, materials, and data collection platform. In addition to demonstrating the reliability of online and in-lab segmentation performance at moderate sample sizes, this study supports the use of segmentation data to infer when events are likely to be segmented.

Its etiological agent is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe pneumonia accompanied by multisystemic failure that can lead to a patient's death. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection. Nonetheless, such immune responses are implicated in the disease's progression to a more severe and lethal process. This review describes the general aspects of both COVID-19 and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, stressing the similarities with other severe coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS, but more importantly, pointing toward the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a consequence of the corresponding variable spectrum of the immune responses to the virus. The critical point where progression of the disease ensues appears to center on loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses due to exacerbation of the inflammatory components. Finally, it appears possible to delineate certain major challenges deserving of exhaustive investigation to further understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, thus helping to design more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic strategies.","output":"Immune Response, Inflammation, and the Clinical Spectrum of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study models the return distributions of the Shanghai Security Composite Index (SSCI) by adding sentiment-aware variables (attention, sentiment, and disagreement), which may affect the jump intensity dynamics or changing the jump size variance, into the GARJI model of Maheu and McCurdy (2004).

While reduced flying capacity may intuitively translate to reduced fatigue risk by way of fewer flights and duty hours, the actual impact of the pandemic on pilot fatigue is unknown.METHODS: We surveyed U.S. commercial airline pilots in late 2020 (N = 669) and early 2021 (N = 156) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on schedules and fatigue during the pandemic.RESULTS: Overall, pilots reported reduced flight and duty hours compared to prepandemic. Average sleep on workdays was slightly shorter in late 2020 (6.87  1.14 h) and recovered to prepandemic levels in early 2021 (6.95  1.11 h). Similarly, the frequency of sleepiness on days off and in-flight increased in late 2020, with 54% of pilots reporting an increase in in-flight sleepiness, then returned to prepandemic levels in early 2021. The use of in-flight sleepiness countermeasures remained the same across assessed time points. Pilots highlighted several factors which impacted their sleep and job performance, including limited access to nutritional food during duty days and layovers, reduced access to exercise facilities during layovers, increased stress due to job insecurity and health concerns, increased distractions and workload, and changes to scheduling.DISCUSSION: Despite a reduction in flights and duty days, COVID-19 led to increased sleepiness on days off and in flight, potentially due to the negative impact of lack of access to essential needs and heightened stress on sleep.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study carried out in June 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 13 426 individuals from 19 countries. RESULTS: More than 60% of all respondents felt their government had communicated adequately during the pandemic. National variances ranged from 83.4% in China down to 37.2% in Brazil, but overall, males and those with a higher income were more likely to rate government communications highly. Almost half (48.8%) of the respondents felt their government had ensured adequate access to physical health services (ranging from 89.3% for Singapore to 27.2% for Poland), with higher ratings reported by younger and higher-income respondents. Ratings of mental health support were lower overall (32.9%, ranging from 74.8% in China to around 15% in Brazil and Sweden), but highest among younger respondents. Providing support for basic necessities of food and housing was rated highest overall in China (79%) and lowest in Ecuador (14.6%), with higher ratings reported by younger, higher-income and better-educated respondents across all countries. The same three demographic groups tended to rate their country's support to vulnerable groups more highly than other respondents, with national scores ranging from around 75% (Singapore and China) to 19.5% (Sweden). Subgroup findings are mostly independent of intercountry variations with 15% of variation being due to intercountry differences.

Since the current situation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which infected among the world and caused severe disease and high morbidity, it urgently needed to find new agents against COVID-19. Therefore, in silico screening against COVID-19 receptors is carried out as an initial stage of drug discovery by evaluating the activity of phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin, an isolated from Phyllanthus niruri, in inhibiting spike glycoprotein (6LZG) and main protease (5R7Y) which play as target receptors of COVID-19. METHODS: Molegro Virtual Docker 6.0 used to determine the best binding energy through the rerank score which shows the total energy bonds calculation. RESULTS: Phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin demonstrated to possess greater binding affinity toward the COVID-19 inhibition sites than their native ligand. The rerank score of phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin are lower than the native ligands 6LZG and 5R7Y. This result indicated that phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin have a stronger interaction than the native ligands both in spike glycoprotein (entry inhibitor) and main protease (translation and replication inhibitor). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin are predicted to have strong activity against COVID-19 through inhibiting spike glycoprotein and main protease under in silico study.

How has this leadership role evolved over time, particularly with the recent global crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic? In addition, will Chinas rising role in providing badly needed global public goods reinforce its rivalry with a declining US, present the opportunity of co-leading with its BRICS counterparts, or mediate and foster co-operative solutions among all? This study seeks to address these critical questions using quantitative analysis based on G20 compliance data since its start in 2008, and especially at the recent Osaka Summit in June 2019 and the emergency virtual summit on March 26, 2020. Specifically, this study analyses Chinas changing compliance levels over time and across issue areas, in comparison with its key G20 partners (or rivals): the US, India and Russia. Observing Chinas compliance trends alongside those of other major G20 powers provides important insights into the characteristics, evolution and interactions of Chinas leadership. This analysis finds that Chinas leadership role has increased over time but that China remains largely a flexible and co-operative leader. From 2008 to 2018, Chinas compliance rose while that of the US declined. Overall, China leads more with its BRICS partners than with the US. Chinas leadership model has been characterized by flexibility and cooperativeness, as China has never led alone, and Chinas closest compliance companions vary across different issue areas.

One is that the perceived probability of being infected for each individual is the same (uniform case). The other is that the perceived probability of being infected is positively correlated to individual degrees (preferential case).

Here, we report a case of aortic root abscess that occurred as a complication of S. epidermidis prosthetic valve endocarditis, which is a rare cause of aortic abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: 71-year-old woman with complex cardiac history including a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta aneurysm repair, and coronary artery bypass graft x4 presented to the ER with worsening chest pain, fevers, chills and rigors. On arrival, temperature was 97.5F heart rate was 61 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 per minute and blood pressure was 139/82 mm Hg. On exam, she had a grade 4/6 ejection systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to carotids. Laboratory investigations showed hemoglobin, 10.5 g/ dL;total leukocyte count, 10 k/uL with 80% neutrophils;platelet count, 311 k/uL;and sedimentation rate, 74 mm/hr. Rest of the labs were normal. She tested negative for SARS-Cov-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood cultures grew isolated Staphylococcus epidermidis. She was persistently bacteremic on vancomycin monotherapy and required ceftaroline and daptomycin combination therapy for clearance of bacteremia. Transesophageal echo cardiography was obtained which showed an area of echolucency adjacent to the posterior aortic valve annulus suggestive of abscess.

Regardless of what species serve as host or vectors, and of the geographic distribution and the mechanisms of replication, arboviruses tend to have slow evolutionary rates in nature. The hypothesis that this is the result of replication in the disparate environments provided by host and vector did not receive solid experimental support in any of the many viral species tested. Instead, it seems that from the virus's point of view, either the two environments are sufficiently similar or one of the environments so dominates viral evolution that there is tolerance for suboptimal adaptation to the other environment. Replication in alternating environments has an unexpected cost in that there is decreased genetic variance that translates into a compromised adaptability for bypassed environments. Arboviruses under strong and continuous positive selection may have unusual patterns of genomic changes, with few or no mutations accumulated in the consensus sequence or with dN/dS values typically consistent with random drift in DNA-based organisms.","output":"Specific and nonspecific host adaptation during arboviral experimental evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal is to provide a review of the impact, global estimates, and projection of vision impairment as well as ongoing systems for eye care delivery.

Neutropenia predisposes patients to fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Antibacterial antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis have caused a significant reduction in some of these infections. There are two main types of cutaneous infections : primary cutaneous infections and cutaneous manifestations of a disseminated infection. In the latter, skin lesions may be the window to disseminated bloodstream infection and the first and only evidence of a disseminated life threatening infection. The diagnosis may be at your fingertips; therefore a thorough skin exam is the clue. However, its also important to know the characteristic lesions associated with different infections. It will help expedite diagnosis so appropriate treatment is initiated promptly in neutropenic patients, which can be lifesaving. In a retrospective study of 43 neutropenic febrile patients with cutaneous lesions, fungal infections were the most frequent, and nodular lesions on the lower extremities were the most prevalent (Naorungroj and Aiempanakit, J Am Acad Dermatol 74:AB166, 2016). Skin biopsy for pathological study and culture remains the gold standard and should be obtained early to confirm the suspected diagnosis. In these immunocompromised patients the inflammatory response is altered by either the primary disease or its treatment. Therefore, routine pathogens may present in an atypical fashion, with diminished or absent induration, erythema, or pustulation in response to bacterial resulting cutaneous infection without typical cellulitis (Urabe, Clin Infect Dis 39:S53CS55, 2004). Skin lesions are evaluated not only by morphology, but also in the context of the clinical setting and biopsy result. The skin biopsy is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive and without contraindication, and may avoid the need for more invasive procedures such an open lung biopsy (Grossman, et al., Cutaneous manifestations of infection in the immunocompromised host. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, New York, 2012).

As Omicron spreads globally, the COVID-19 booster vaccination has been acknowledged as the primary strategy against this variant. In this study, we identify factors related to the willingness of workers in megacities to take the vaccine booster shots and their main reasons accounting for their booster willingness. This research survey was conducted in megacity H in eastern China, and a total of 1227 employees from different industries were interviewed. The study at hand examines the relationship between various characteristics (including both economic and non-economic factors) of urban employees and their intention/desire to accept the COVID-19 booster shoots. The survey results show that some characteristics, namely work organization, vaccine knowledge, and social network, affect their intention to take COVID-19 vaccine booster shots. Urban employees with a strong work organization, a high degree of vaccine knowledge, and a dense social capital are more likely to receive booster injections than other employees. Therefore, work organization, vaccine knowledge, and social networks provide fundamental entry points for designing enhanced injection strategies to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among employees in megacities.","output":"An Analysis of the Willingness to the COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots among Urban Employees: Evidence from a Megacity H in Eastern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tissue damage leading to obstructive lung disease (OLD) could result from intravenous administration of insoluble particles found in illicit drugs. This study described the prevalence and identified correlates of OLD among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: In 2012-2016, a community-based cohort of PWID who had injected within the past month were enrolled in a study to assess HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and their related risk factors. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews, serological testing and spirometry. Baseline data were used for a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and correlates of OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with OLD. RESULTS: Among 516 participants who had complete spirometry and interview results, the mean age was 43.3 years, 73.6 % were male, 9.5 % were Black, 91.1 % smoked cigarettes and 18.2 % had OLD. Few (9.6 %) PWID with OLD reported a previous diagnosis of COPD although many (44.7 %) reported related symptoms. Black race (AOR = 2.66, 95 %CI: 1.37, 5.17), pack-years smoked (AOR = 1.06/5 years, 95 %CI: 1.01, 1.12), and duration of injection drug use (AOR = 1.13, 95 %CI: 1.01, 1.27) were independently associated with OLD after controlling for age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OLD was high in this cohort and associated with Black race and cigarette smoking-known risk factors. In addition, OLD prevalence increased with greater duration of injection drug use, suggesting a link between cumulative exposure to injected insoluble particles and OLD.

Though these adaptations may help maintain services during COVID-19, they may also trigger mechanisms capable of fundamentally shifting MCM use and community perceptions of FP long after routine services are restored if they fail to take into account the contexts in which they are implemented. This study aimed to model the context-specific effects of suggested adaptations to FP service delivery. Methods: C A multi-step approach to modelling using qualitative methods was employed. Methods involved a targeted review of relevant literature on adaptations to FP service delivery, the development of context categories using empirical findings from five countries, and the construction of a model based on realist concepts to predict the mechanisms and outcomes likely to be triggered by adaptations to FP service delivery in specific contexts. Results: C Eleven key adaptations to FP service delivery were identified, and 19 mechanisms and their associated outcomes were predicted. The model revealed 8 negative and 11 positive effects of suggested adaptations when implemented in contexts where womens decisions around MCM use are influenced by: 1) stigma surrounding FP;2) male control of reproductive decisions;3) covert use of MCMs;4) fear of MCM side effects;and 5) concerns about long-acting reversible contraceptives. These effects were predicted to drive changes in MCM use, community perceptions of FP, and womens trust in health services. The model also demonstrated that suggested adaptations are likely to have important long-term effects and result in changes to the prevailing contexts. Conclusions: C Though adaptations to FP service delivery are needed in response to COVID-19, the contexts in which these are implemented should be carefully considered by national and sub-national decision-makers to minimise unwanted outcomes. The model constructed in this study can be leveraged as a theorising tool to facilitate this process in different settings.","output":"Accounting for Context: Using Qualitative Methods to Model the Effects of Adaptations to Family Planning Services During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a puzzle as to why more severe haze formed during the New Year Holiday in 2020 (NYH-20), when China was in an unprecedented state of shutdown to contain the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, than in 2019 (NYH-19).

While mitigation strategies have been successful on a local level, population-wide decreases in spread are rare. Objective To evaluate whether internet search interest and emergency department visits for infectious conjunctivitis were associated with public health interventions adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants Internet search data from the US and emergency department data from a single academic center in the US were used in this study. Publicly available smartphone mobility data were temporally aligned to quantify social distancing. Internet search term trends for nonallergic conjunctivitis, corneal abrasions, and posterior vitreous detachments were obtained. Additionally, all patients who presented to a single emergency department from February 2015 to February 2021 were included in a review. Physician notes for emergency department visits at a single academic center with the same diagnoses were extracted. Causal inference was performed using a bayesian structural time-series model. Data were compared from before and after April 2020, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended members of the public wear masks, stay at least 6 feet from others who did not reside in the same home, avoid crowds, and quarantine if experiencing flulike symptoms or exposure to persons with COVID-19 symptoms. Exposures Symptoms of or interest in conjunctivitis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome and Measures The hypothesis was that there would be a decrease in internet search interest and emergency department visits for infectious conjunctivitis after the adaptation of public health measures targeted to curb COVID-19. Results A total of 1156 emergency department encounters with a diagnosis of conjunctivitis were noted from January 2015 to February 2021. Emergency department encounters for nonallergic conjunctivitis decreased by 37.3% (95% CI, -12.9% to -60.6%; P < .001). In contrast, encounters for corneal abrasion (1.1% [95% CI, -29.3% to 29.1%]; P = .47) and posterior vitreous detachments (7.9% [95% CI, -46.9% to 66.6%]; P = .39) remained stable after adjusting for total emergency department encounters. Search interest in conjunctivitis decreased by 34.2% (95% CI, -30.6% to -37.6%; P < .001) after widespread implementation of public health interventions to mitigate COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Public health interventions, such as social distancing, increased emphasis on hygiene, and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, were associated with decreased search interest in nonallergic conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis-associated emergency department encounters.

This information was then used in planning future service development. The project was funded by the National Health Service (NHS) Peninsula Cancer Alliance and took place in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Digital slides of 500 cases from Taunton were reported remotely in Truro, Plymouth, Exeter, Bristol, or Bath by using a single remote reporting platform located on the secure Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) that links NHS sites. These were mainly small gastrointestinal, skin, and gynecological specimens. The digital diagnoses were compared with the diagnoses issued on reporting the glass slides. At the end of the project, the pathologists completed a Google Forms questionnaire of their perceptions of digital pathology. The results were presented at a meeting with the funder and discussed. RESULTS: From the 500 cases there were nine cases of significant diagnostic discrepancy, seven of which involved the misrecognition of Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsies. The questionnaire at the end of the project showed that there was a general agreement that the platform was easy to use, and the image quality was acceptable. It was agreed that extra work, such as deeper levels, was easy to request on the software platform. Most pathologists did not agree that digital reporting was quicker than glass slide reporting. Some were less confident in their digital diagnoses than glass diagnoses. They agreed that some types of specimens cannot easily be reported digitally. All users indicated that they would like to report at least half of their work digitally in the future if they could, and all strongly agreed that digital pathology would improve access to expert opinions, teaching, and multidisciplinary meetings.

Epidemiological data from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and recent Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak indicate that there may be sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes. To investigate these differences, we infected male and female mice of different age groups with SARS-CoV and analyzed their susceptibility to the infection. Our results showed that male mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection compared with age-matched females. The degree of sex bias to SARS-CoV infection increased with advancing age, such that middle-aged mice showed much more pronounced differences compared with young mice. Enhanced susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV was associated with elevated virus titers, enhanced vascular leakage, and alveolar edema. These changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory monocyte macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of male mice, and depletion of inflammatory monocyte macrophages partially protected these mice from lethal SARS. Moreover, the sex-specific differences were independent of T and B cell responses. Furthermore, ovariectomy or treating female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist increased mortality, indicating a protective effect for estrogen receptor signaling in mice infected with SARS-CoV. Together, these data suggest that sex differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV in mice parallel those observed in patients and also identify estrogen receptor signaling as critical for protection in females.","output":"Sex-Based Differences in Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A public health crisis is a &ldquo;touchstone&rdquo;for testing the ability and capacity of a national health system In the current era, public health crises are presenting new systematic and cross-border characteristics and uncertainty The essence of a system for public health crisis governance is the rules administering the stimulus&ndash;response chain The health system generally emphasizes joint participation and communication between different subjects, which may lead to overlap and redundancy as well as a lack of auxiliary support for major public health crisis events In the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, we track the responses, challenges, and implications of the temporary disruption of the health system and its response to this major public health crisis We examine local governance capacity, performance in pandemic control, and the coordinated responses to COVID-19 Accordingly, we identify the challenges to the health system, including the imbalance in attention given to medical care versus health care, insufficient grassroots public health efforts and control capacity, and untimely information disclosure It is strongly suggested that the government improve its cognitive ability and focus more attention on building and strengthening the emergency health system","output":"COVID-19 in China: Responses, Challenges and Implications for the Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To analyze clinical and thin-section computed tomographic (CT) data from the patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to predict the development of pulmonary fibrosis after hospital discharge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (31 males, 28 females; mean age: 41 years, range: 25 to 70 years) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax. After 31.5 days of hospital admission, the results of thin-section CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups, group A (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group B (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) patients had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase. Out of 59 patients, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B). Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs. 15.0 days), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7 vs. 18.1 mg/L), and higher maximal CT score (5.2 vs. 4.0) than those in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.

Respiratory dynamics in an obese patient, combined with modified lung physiology of ARDS, present a significant challenge in managing obese patients with ARDS. Many physicians think of obesity as a relative contraindication to ECMO. We performed a meta-analysis to see the effect of obesity on weaning from ECMO and survival to hospital discharge. METHODS: We searched online databases for studies on ECMO and obesity. The search yielded 49 citations in total; after extensive review, six studies were assessed and qualified to be included in the final analysis. Patients were stratified into BMI >30 kg/m(2) (obese) and BMI < 30 kg/m(2) (nonobese). RESULTS: In meta-analysis, there was a total sample population of 1285 patients, with 466 in the obese group and 819 in the nonobese group. There was no significant difference in weaning from ECMO when compared between obese and nonobese patients, with a risk ratio of 1.03 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.94C1.13 (heterogeneity: chi(2) = 7.44, df = 4 (p=0.11), I(2) = 46%).

A total of 18 uninfected staff members working alongside them in the same environment and 18 random matched infected doctors and nurses formed two control groups; the psychological impact of these three groups was then compared. Results: Of the 18 members of staff, 88.89% were infected due to the working environment (hospital), and nine had face-to-face conversations with doctors and nurses in their daily work. Many staff members did not take any protective measures in their routine work. Before they were diagnosed, 12 staff members were aware of the seriousness of the epidemic, and most of the staff maintained a neutral attitude to the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 77.78% of the staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes after diagnosis, which were mainly caused by family health and disease related issues.

METHODS: Twenty-five older adults (9 males and 16 females), aged between 66 and 86 years (active group 77.2  3.9; sham group 76.6  6.2), volunteers were randomly allocated in the active (active tDCS + PT) and sham groups (sham tDCS + PT), and received the intervention three times per week for 8 weeks. Pain level, physical activity level, depression state, and quality of life were assessed based on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale, and Short-Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), respectively. Measurements were conducted four times: at baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: As a result, at 8 weeks, the active group yielded greater improvements in VAS, BDI, and SF-36 scores than the sham tDCS group.

Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","output":"Quantifying Type-Specific Reproduction Numbers for Nosocomial Pathogens: Evidence for Heightened Transmission of an Asian Sequence Type 239 MRSA Clone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Global COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020 have burdened health workers, among them surveillance workers who have the responsibility to undertake routine disease surveillance activities.

However, because these patients are increasingly being recognized as prothrombotic, we reviewed their posttransplant thrombotic complications. Because morphological changes might be responsible in part for this prothrombotic state, we also conducted a histopathological review of explants from HIV-positive patients. Between 1990 and 2010, 24 of 3502 recipients (including 23 adults) were HIV-positive at LT. These patients and their postoperative courses were reviewed with a particular focus on vascular complications, risk factors, and outcomes. Another patient in whom HIV was detected 12 years after LT was also examined. Among the 24 HIV-positive LT recipients (17 males and 22 whole liver grafts; median age = 40 years), 5 developed arterial complications [including 3 cases of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), 1 case of generalized arteriopathy (on angiography), and 1 case of endoarteritis (on histological analysis)]. Multiple arterial anastomoses were performed in 8 of the 24 recipients, and HAT occurred twice within this anastomosis group. The outcomes of the 3 patients with HAT included retransplantation, biliary stenting for ischemic cholangiopathy followed by retransplantation, and observation only. In addition, 5 separate venous thrombotic events were detected in the 24 recipients during this period.

In conclusion, the prothrombotic state associated with combined HIV and liver disease is a cause of morbidity after LT: 8 of the 24 recipients (33%) in this series suffered vascular thrombotic complications. There is a potential increase in the risk of HAT: the rate for the HIV-positive cohort was higher than the rate for historical HIV-negative controls [12% versus 3.2%, P = 0.016 (Fisher's exact test)].

However, little is known how these restrictions may impact adult vapers. This study describes the level of support and predictive behavioral responses to a hypothetical NVP ban on non-tobacco flavors among regular adult vapers who only use flavors that would be banned. METHODS Data came from 851 regular vapers (all current or ex-smokers) participating in the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey in Canada, England, and the United States (US). A random sample of respondents in each country received and completed the questions about flavor bans: (1) do you support or oppose a ban on all non-tobacco flavors; and (2) what would you do if all flavors were banned, with the exception of tobacco in the US, and tobacco and menthol in Canada and England. Those who used tobacco-flavored or unflavored NVPs were excluded from all analyses, and additionally, vapers of menthol flavor in Canada and England were excluded from Aim 2. RESULTS Overall, 53.6% of vapers were strongly opposed to flavor bans, 28.2% were opposed, 9.3% were in support, 3.6% were in strong support, and 5.2% did not know. Predicted behavioral responses were: 28.8% would continue vaping an available flavor, 28.3% would find a way to get their banned flavor(s), 17.1% would stop vaping and smoke instead, 12.9% said that they would stop vaping and not smoke, and 12.9% do not know what they would do. Responses to a potential flavor ban largely varied by smoking and vaping status, and by the level of support of a flavor restriction policy. CONCLUSIONS At this time, it is not clear what net population-level consequences would occur if non-tobacco flavored NVPs were prohibited. While a majority of vapers in this study opposed this policy, and many vapers would not be willing to switch to available flavors, there was considerable variability in predicted behavioral responses.","output":"Responses to potential nicotine vaping product flavor restrictions among regular vapers using non-tobacco flavors: Findings from the 2020 ITC Smoking and Vaping Survey in Canada, England and the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected patient care across specialties. Ramifications for neurosurgery include substantial disruptions to surgical training, and changes in nonurgent patient presentations to the emergency department. This study quantifies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of emergency department patients who were referred to the neurosurgery department for further consultation and treatment, and identifies and describes trends in the characteristics of these visits. Methods A retrospective review was performed of neurosurgical consultations at single high-volume institution for 28 call-day periods before and after the official announcement of the pandemic. Primary outcomes included consultations per call-day, patient presentation category, and patient admission. Results The neurosurgical service was consulted regarding 629 patients (male sex, 367 patients) during the study period, with 471 (75%) and 158 (25%) patients presenting before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The mean number of neurosurgical consultations per call-day was significantly lower in the COVID-19 period (5.6 consultations) compared with the preCCOVID-19 period (16.8 consultations) (p<0.001). After adjusting for patient demographics, the rate of presentation for general nonurgent concerns, such as back pain, headaches, and other general weaknesses, significantly decreased (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.60 [0.47C0.77], p <0.001). Conclusions Neurosurgical consultations significantly decreased after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a substantially lower overall number of consultations necessitating operative interventions. Furthermore, the relative number of patients with nonemergent neurological conditions significantly decreased during the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and neurosurgery consultation call volume at a single large tertiary center with a propensity-adjusted analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine organs, cells and tissues provide a viable source of transplants in humans, though there is some concern of public health risk from adaptation of swine infectious agents in humans. Limited information is available on the public health risk of many exogenous swine viruses, and reliable and rapid diagnostic tests are available for only a few of these. The ability of several porcine viruses to cause transplacental fetal infection (parvoviruses, circoviruses, and arteriviruses), emergence or recognition of several new porcine viruses during the last two decades (porcine circovirus, arterivirus, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, and porcine respiratory coronavirus) and the immunosuppressed state of the transplant recipients increases the xenozoonoses risk of humans to porcine viruses through transplantation. Much of this risk can be eliminated with vigilance and sustained monitoring along with a better understanding of pathogenesis and development of better diagnostic tests. In this review we present information on selected exogenous viruses, highlighting their characteristics, pathogenesis of viral infections in swine, methods for their detection, and the potential xenozoonoses risk they present. Emphasis has been given in this review to swine influenza virus, paramyxovirus (Nipah virus, Menagle virus, LaPiedad paramyxovirus, porcine paramyxovirus), arterivirus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) and circovirus as either they represent new swine viruses or present the greatest risk.

Geese show some of the highest levels of interspecific hybridization across all bird orders, and two of the goose species in genus Anser have been domesticated providing excellent opportunity for joint study of domestication and hybridization. Until now, knowledge on the details of the goose domestication process has come from archaeological findings and historical writings supplemented with few studies based on mitochondrial DNA. Here, we used genome-wide markers to make the first genome-based inference of the timing of European goose domestication. We also analyzed the impact of hybridization on the genome-wide genetic variation in current populations of the European domestic goose and its wild progenitor: the greylag goose (Anser anser). Our dataset consisted of 58 wild greylags sampled around Eurasia and 75 domestic geese representing 14 breeds genotyped for 33,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Demographic reconstruction and clustering analysis suggested that divergence between wild and domestic geese around 5,300 generations ago was followed by long-term genetic exchange, and that greylag populations have 3.2C58.0% admixture proportions with domestic geese, with distinct geographic patterns. Surprisingly, many modern European breeds share considerable (> 10%) ancestry with Chinese domestic geese that is derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoid. We show that domestication process can progress despite continued and pervasive gene flow from the wild form. Significance Statement Reproductive isolation between conspecific wild and domestic populations is a cornerstone of the domestication process, yet gene flow between such wild and domestic populations has been frequently documented. European domestic geese and their wild progenitor (greylags) co-occur and can hybridize and we show that they represent a particularly persuasive case where wild and domestic populations are not isolated gene pools. Our study makes a first genome-based estimate of goose domestication, which up to now has mostly relied on archaeological findings and historical writings. We show ongoing gene flow between greylags and European domestic geese following domestication, but we also observe a surprisingly large contribution of Chinese domestic geese (a separate species) to the genetic make-up of European domestic geese.","output":"Long-term reciprocal gene flow in wild and domestic geese reveals complex domestication history"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies highlight that economic expectations are a crucial determinant of citizens satisfaction with democracy (SWD).

Prior reports of testing have reported low sensitivities of nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reports of viral co-infections have varied from 0-20%. Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of nasopharyngeal PCR for COVID-19 and rates of viral co-infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who received viral testing between March 1, 2020-April 28, 2020. Test results of a complete viral pathogen panel and COVID-19 testing were abstracted. We compared patients with more than one COVID-19 test for diagnostic accuracy against the gold standard of chart review. RESULTS: We identified 1950 patients, of whom 1024 were tested for COVID-19. There were 221 repeat tests for COVID-19. Among patients with a repeat test, COVID-19 swabs had a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.5-94.4%) and a specificity of 99.5% (95%CI, 97-100%) compared to a clinical and radiographic criterion reference by chart review. We found viral co-infection rates of 2.3% in patients without COVID-19 and 6.1% in patients with COVID-19. Rates of co-infection appeared to be related to base rates of infection in the community and not a specific property of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR specimens are accurate but have imperfect sensitivity. Repeat testing for high-risk patients should be considered, and presence of an alternative virus should not be used to limit testing for COVID-19 for patients where it would affect treatment or isolation.","output":"Practical Diagnostic Accuracy of Nasopharyngeal Swab Testing for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is the physiologic reaction to cellular and tissue damage caused by pathologic processes including trauma, infection, and ischemia(1). Effective inflammatory responses integrate molecular and cellular functions to prevent further tissue damage, initiate repair, and restore homeostasis, while futile or dysfunctional responses allow escalating injury, delay recovery, and may hasten death(2). Elevation of white blood cell count (WBC) and altered levels of other acute phase reactants are cardinal signs of inflammation, but the dynamics of these changes and their resolution are not established(3,4). Patient responses appear to vary dramatically with no clearly defined signs of good prognosis, leaving physicians reliant on qualitative interpretations of laboratory trends(4,5). We retrospectively, observationally studied the human acute inflammatory response to trauma, ischemia, and infection by tracking the longitudinal dynamics of cellular and serum markers in hospitalized patients. Unexpectedly, we identified a conserved pattern of recovery defined by co-regulation of WBC and platelet (PLT) populations. Across all inflammatory conditions studied, recovering patients followed a consistent WBC-PLT trajectory shape that is well-approximated by exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT growth. This recovery trajectory shape may represent a fundamental archetype of human physiologic response at the cellular population scale, and provides a generic approach for identifying high-risk patients: 32x relative risk of adverse outcomes for cardiac surgery patients, 9x relative risk of death for COVID-19, and 5x relative risk of death for myocardial infarction.","output":"White Blood Cell and Platelet Dynamics Define Human Inflammatory Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinicians in resource-limited settings commonly use the World Health Organization criteria to diagnose pneumonia in children.

Thus, early identification of AKI is mandatory, and alternative diagnostic strategies become plausible: one of them, Renal Angina Index (RAI), described by Matsuura(1), predicts the development of AKI KDIGO 2-3, at 7th day after admission to the intensive care unit according to a cut-off point >6 on a scale with a creatinine score (determined by the difference in serum creatinine between that at ICU admission and the first 24 hours in the ICU) and the impact of the patients medical history. (1)Kidney Int Rep (2018) 3, 677-683. Our aim is to describe predictive capacity of the Renal Angina Index (RAI) in adult critical care patients in our population. METHOD: We retrospectively selected from our Critical Care Nephrology database adult patients admitted in any of our hospital\`s ICU between February to August 2020, excluding those at admission with diagnosis of AKI, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl, or those receiving dialysis (acute or chronic) or kidney transplantation. We defined AKI according to KDIGO criteria. The RAI score was defined as the worst condition score multiplied by the creatinine score. The performance of the RAI score was assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis power to detect a difference of 0.2 between the area under the curve (AUC), under the null hypothesis of AUC = 0.5 (no diagnostic accuracy). The optimal cut point was estimated with the Youden method. RESULTS: From 1204 new ICU patients, we included 372 patients (women 40.3%), with mean age 60.9 (18-98) (table 1). Main indication for ICU admission was medical conditions. Mean APACHE II was 22.9, hemodinamic support was required in 41,1% patients, mechanical ventilation in 58.6% patients and diabetes mellitus was present in 21.5% patients. AKI KDIGO 2-3 developed in 26.8% of patients. Mean creatinine at admission was statistically different in patients with AKI (CI 0.95 C0.51 - --0.15 mg/dl, p=0.0004). The requirement of hemodynamic (p = 0.003) and ventilatory support (p = 0.009), sepsis (p = 0.003), and COVID-19 (p = 0.03) were more frequent in patients who developed AKI. Renal replacement therapy was required in 39 (60%) of patients with severe AKI (incidence 10,5%). RAI cutt-off point determined by Youden method in the overall sample was 24, being significantly higher in patients who developed AKI (16.54 Vs 7.47, CI 0.95 C13.5--4.99, p <0.001). A cut-off point of 24 was required for the Best predictive capacity for severe AKI, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio of 34%, 94%, 5.5 and 0.7 respectively.

We present an initial evaluation of self-reported pediatric surgical policy changes from hospitals across North America. METHODS: On March 30, 2020, an online open access, data gathering spreadsheet was made available to pediatric surgeons through the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) website, which captured information surrounding COVID-19 related policy changes. Responses from the first month of the pandemic were collected. Open-ended responses were evaluated and categorized into themes and descriptive statistics were performed to identify areas of consensus. RESULTS: Responses from 38 hospitals were evaluated. Policy changes relating to three domains of program structure and care processes were identified: internal structure, clinical workflow, and COVID-19 safety/prevention. Inter-hospital consensus was high for reducing in-hospital staffing, limiting clinical fellow exposure, implementing telehealth for conducting outpatient clinical visits, and using universal precautions for trauma. Heterogeneity in practices existed for scheduling procedures, implementing testing protocols, and regulating use of personal protective equipment.

Different animal species can serve as reservoirs and sources of dissemination of the disease, such as rodent species due their potential in transmitting zoonotic pathogens to humans and other animals. In the Canary Islands (Spain), Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis have been identified in patients with diarrhea. However, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in possible reservoirs in this archipelago remains unclear. Considering the zoonotic potential of these protozoans, the aim of the present study was to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in peridomestic wild rodents and the possible role of these mammals as a source of transmission of these protozoans in Canary Islands. METHODS A total of 179 rodents belonging to Rattus rattus and Mus musculus domesticus from four Canary Islands, La Palma, El Hierro, Tenerife and Lanzarote, were analyzed. Feces were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by nested PCR of the 18S ribosomal RNA fragment and the sequences used for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS Cryptosporidium spp. were found widely distributed with an overall prevalence of 12.30% in rodents (13.86% for R. rattus and 10.25% for M. m. domesticus). The overall prevalence by island was 19.60% for Tenerife, 7.14% for La Palma, 5.71% for El Hierro and 0% for Lanzarote. Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium sp. rat genotype I and II/III were successfully identified, in addition to two unidentified Cryptosporidium genotypes. CONCLUSIONS This study contributes to the knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents from the Canary Islands, highlighting the presence of three zoonotic species, C. tyzzeri, C. meleagridis and C. muris, being the first detection of these three species in wild rodents in the Canary Islands and the first report of C. meleagridis in R. rattus.

As the connection rate decreases from the original network connection, the epidemic threshold in which epidemic phase transits from disease-free to endemic increases, and the final epidemic size decreases. Additionally, for comparison with sparse and heterogeneous networks, the pair approximation models were applied to a heterogeneous network with a degree distribution. The obtained phase diagram reveals that, upon increasing the degree of the original random regular networks and decreasing the effective connections by introducing void nodes accordingly, the final epidemic size of the sparse network is close to that of the random network with average degree of 4.

The virus, SARS-CoV-2 can cause a range of symptoms ranging from mild through fulminant respiratory failure. Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require admission to the intensive care unit, with the majority of those requiring mechanical ventilation. High density consolidations in the bronchial tree and in the pulmonary parenchyma have been described in the advanced phase of the disease. We noted a subset of patients who had a sudden, significant increase in peak airway, plateau and peak inspiratory pressures. Partial or complete ETT occlusion was noted to be the culprit in the majority of these patients. METHODS: With institutional IRB approval, we examined a subset of our mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. All of the patients were admitted to one of our COVID-19 ICUs. Each was staffed by a board certified intensivist. During multidisciplinary rounds, all arterial blood gas (ABG) results, ventilator settings and ventilator measurements are discussed and addressed. ARDSNet Protocols are employed. In patients with confirmed acute occlusion of the endotracheal tube (ETT), acute elevation in peak airway and peak inspiratory pressures are noted in conjunction with desaturation. Data was collected retrospectively and demographics, ventilatory settings and ABG results were recorded. RESULTS: Our team has observed impeded ventilation in intubated patients who are several days into the critical course. Pathologic evaluation of the removed endotracheal tube contents from one of our patients demonstrated a specimen consistent with sloughed tracheobronchial tissues and inflammatory cells in a background of dense mucin.

There are preliminary results that gene polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system can influence the susceptibility to and mortality from COVID-19. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) might be a gene candidate that exerts such influence. The aim of this study was to elaborate on the association between A1166C at1r polymorphic variants and the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in the Ukrainian population. METHODS: The study population consisted of the Ukrainian population (Poltava region) with COVID-19, divided into three clinical groups in accordance with oxygen requirement: patients without oxygen therapy (n = 110), with non-invasive (n = 136) and invasive (n = 36) oxygen therapy. The A1166C polymorphism of the at1r was determined by polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restrictase analysis. In an attempt to better explain the role of the A1166C at1r polymorphism we compared its association with COVID-19, essential hypertension (n = 79), renoparenchimal hypertension (n = 30) and dyscirculatory encephalopathy (n = 112). The data for this comparison were obtained by meta-analysis. RESULTS: We observed significant differences in the frequency of AA, AC and CC genotypes in the groups of COVID-19 patients with non-invasive and invasive oxygen therapy in comparison with control subjects as well as in the frequency of combined AC + CC genotype between the groups of COVID-19 patients with any types of oxygen therapy and patients without oxygen therapy.

We compare the performance of CARSS in unplanned admissions with COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic. Design: a retrospective cross-sectional study Setting: Two acute hospitals (Scarborough and York) are combined into a single dataset and analysed collectively. Participants: Adult (>=18 years) non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS electronically recorded within 24 hours. We assessed the performance of all four risk score (for sepsis: CARS_N, CARS_NB; for mortality: CARM_N, CARM_NB) according to discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (graphically) in predicting the risk of COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality. Results: The risk of in-hospital mortality following emergency medical admission was 8.4% (500/6444) and 9.6% (620/6444) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. For predicting COVID-19 admissions, the CARS_N model had the highest discrimination 0.73 (0.71 to 0.75) and calibration slope 0.81 (0.72 to 0.89). For predicting in-hospital mortality, the CARM_NB model had the highest discrimination 0.84 (0.82 to 0.75) and calibration slope 0.89 (0.81 to 0.98). Conclusions: Two of the computer-aided risk scores (CARS_N and CARM_NB) are reasonably accurate for predicting the risk of COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality, respectively.

The authors reported a complex case of intradiploic intraosseous metaplastic meningioma of the left medial wall and orbital roof with the left frontal sinus invasion and left ethmoidal body bone substitution. The authors also conducted a systematic review concerning diagnosis and management of patients affected by purely calvarial intradiploic meningiomas along with a focus on fronto-orbito-ethmoidal ones. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement and with the following Mesh terms: Intradiploic, intraosseous, calvarial, and meningioma. Eligibility criteria were limited by the nature of existing literature on intradiploic meningiomas, consisting of only case series, and case reports. RESULTS: A total of 128 published studies were identified through our search. 41 studies were included in this systematic review, 59 patients with a female/male ratio of 1.2/1. The mean age of the patients is of 47.69 years (range 3C84 years). Only seven out of 59 patients (11.9%) presented a complex intradiploic meningioma located in fronto-orbito-ethmoidal region like our case.

In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnairesCOVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individuals engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors.","output":"The interplay between anxiety, fear, protective behaviors, compassion, and resilience among older adults during a COVID-19 lockdown: a structural equation modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines the processes of memory securitization in the Russian Federation and Latvia during the coronavirus crisis The key factor that allowed the authors to make such a statement about the problem was the temporary coincidence of the pandemic with the 75th anniversary of the final defeat of Nazi Germany and the so-called Victory Day As a theoretical basis for the study, we use the constructivist understanding of security in order to study, with specific examples, how the threat in the form of a pandemic became a frame for securitization of memory The authors identify the peculiarities of the articulating of security problems by political elites in two states with different memory regimes framed by the pandemic as an external factor","output":"Securitization of Memory in the Pandemic Period: The Case of Russia and Latvia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to assess the association of periodontal disease and COVID 19 Coronavirus have been announced pandemic along the globe by the WHO, which have severely affected every countries healthcare framework and health care professionals globally Due to this pandemic every individual facing severe problems both economically and emotionally The similarity seen on inflammatory response pathway shows there is a potential relationship between COVID-19 and Periodontitis are related Considering the relationship, significant importance should be given to maintain periodontal health, maintaining careful and good oral hygiene in the COVID-19 situation There is also chance of feasibility that periodontal disease can be susceptible for an individual's COVID-19 unfavourable outcomes This relationship shows the interrelation among periodontal disease and COVID-19 and between the cytokine relationship which advices in improving hygiene in oral cavity during this COVID situation And it is found individuals with periodontal disease have high risk of getting COVID associated unfavourable consequences","output":"Periodontal Disease and COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of several promising drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged.

The assessment of personal exposure to COVID-19 in enclosed spaces is critical to identifying potential infectees and preventing outbreaks. However, traditional contact tracing methods rely heavily on a manual interview, which is costly and time consuming given the large population involved. With advanced indoor localisation techniques, it is possible to collect people's footprints accurately by locating their smartphones. This study presents a new framework for the assessment of personal exposure to COVID-19 carriers using their fine-grained trajectory data. An integral model was established to quantify the exposure risk, in which the spatial and temporal decay effects are simultaneously considered when modelling the airborne transmission of COVID-19. Regarding the obstacle effect of the indoor layout on airborne transmission, a weight graph based on the space syntax technique was further introduced to constrain the transmission strength between subspaces that are less inter-visible. The proposed framework was demonstrated by a simulation study, in which external comparison and internal analysis were conducted to justify its validity and robustness in different scenarios. Our method is expected to promote the efficient identification of potential infectees and provide an extensible spatialCtemporal model to simulate different control measures and examine their effectiveness in a built environment.","output":"Assessing personal exposure to COVID-19 transmission in public indoor spaces based on fine-grained trajectory data: A simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmacist-managed protocol for transitioning critically ill patients from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous insulin. METHODS This single-center, retrospective, observational study included patients admitted to the medical or surgical/trauma intensive care unit who received a continuous infusion of IV insulin from January 2019 to April 2021. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 years old, pregnant, or incarcerated or received IV insulin for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, calcium channel blocker or -blocker overdose, or hypertriglyceridemia. The primary outcome was to evaluate the percentage of blood glucose (BG) concentrations within the target range of 70 to 150 mg/dL within 48 hours of the transition to subcutaneous insulin. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of BG concentrations within the goal range following transition at 0 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours, the incidence of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the percentage of patients requiring dose adjustments after the initial transition. RESULTS Pharmacists were able to achieve BG concentrations in the target range for 53% of transitions at 12 hours, 40% of transitions at 24 hours, and 47% of transitions at 48 hours. With respect to safety endpoints, the pharmacist-managed group had a low rate of hypoglycemia (1.0%) and no severe hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia was reported for 28% of BG concentrations while severe hyperglycemia was reported for 27%. Pharmacists transitioned patients to an average of 63% of the 24-hour total daily dose of insulin as basal insulin. CONCLUSION Pharmacists can effectively and safely transition critically ill patients from IV to subcutaneous insulin utilizing a standardized protocol.","output":"Development of a pharmacist-managed protocol for the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin in critically ill adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) can have a myriad of symptoms. However, it is now known that most patients recovered from COVID-19 have symptoms related to COVID-19. There is a paucity of literature on post-COVID-19 symptoms from India. Hence we aimed to assess the incidence of post-COVID-19 symptoms in patients recovered from COVID-19. Methods: An online Microsoft forms survey was conducted through multiple social media platforms. Results: Of the 5,347 individuals who received and clicked the link, a total of 2038 infected patients responded (Supplementary figure). Approximately 48% (967/2038) had recovered from COVID-19 within 1-3 months (short-term recovered), 34.2% (375/2038) had recovered from COVID-19 >3 months ago (long recovered), and 18.4% (375) were recovered within the last one month (recently recovered). Nearly 38% (770/2038) had a history of hospitalization for COVID-19. Of them, 34.28% (264/770) required oxygen therapy during the hospital stay. Most patients were discharged within 5-10 days of hospital stay (54%, 415/770). Only 5.58% (43/770) required a stay of more than 20 days. Seventy-five percent (575/770) of the hospitalized patients received steroid therapy. Of those who received steroid therapy, 56.5% (325/575) had not required oxygen therapy. Forty percent (233/575) of patients received steroid therapy for two weeks, 24% (138/575) for one week, 33.73% received steroids only during the hospital stay, and 1.73% were still on steroid therapy during the survey. Most importantly, of the 2038 respondents, 41.8% (851/2038) still had persistent symptoms related to COVID-19. Most common symptom was fatigue (64.15%), followed by body pain (31%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (25%) (Figure). Six percent (49/851) of them required hospitalization for post-COVID-19 symptoms. Forty-six percent (449/967) in the short term recovered group (1-3 months), 40.1% (279/696) in the long-recovered group, and 32.8% (123/375) in the recently recovered group had persistent symptoms related to COVID-19 (P=0.001). Forty-eight percent (374/770) of the hospitalized patients developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, while only 37.6% (477/1268) developed post-COVID-19 symptoms among the non-hospitalized patients (P<0.001). Fifty-three percent (303/575) of those who received steroids developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, while only 36.41% (71/195) of those who did not receive steroids developed post-COVID-19 symptoms (P<0.001). 49% (159/325) of patients who received steroids despite being not requiring oxygen developed post-COVID-19 symptoms compared to only 37.5% (543/1449) who did not receive steroids and were not on oxygen therapy (P<0.001).

Propolis resin exerts a diversity of biological activities, such as antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and defense of the hive against pathogens. Chemical standardization and identification of botanical sources is crucial for characterization of propolis. Types of Brazilian propolis are characteristic of geographical regions and respective biomes, such as savannas (Cerrado), mangroves, dry forest (Caatinga), rain forests (Amazon, Atlantic, and Interior forests), altitudinal fields (Campos Rupestres), Pantanal, and Araucaria forests.

Factors accounting for the restricted number of known types of Brazilian propolis and plant sources are tentatively pointed out. Among them, the paper discusses constraints that honey bees must overcome to collect plant exudates, including the characteristics of the lapping-chewing mouthpart of honey bee, which limit their possibilities to cut and chew plant tissues, as well as chemical requirements that plant resins must fulfil, involving antimicrobial activity of its constituents and innocuity to the insects.

Methods: In this IRB approved retrospective electronic case review, all IR patients in our institution from 1 January to 9 July 2020, the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak were included. IR procedures were classified using Interventional Radiology C Procedure Acuity Scale (IR-PAS) and category of IR procedures. Along with descriptive frequencies, the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test of independence were performed. Results: During the pandemic, 3655 IR procedures were performed compared to 3851 procedures pre-pandemic. No statistically significant difference in weekly IR caseloads across IR-PAS tiers between both periods (p = .088) and category of procedure (p = .054) were noted. General intervention procedures remained the largest proportion and musculoskeletal procedures the minority, in both periods.

The aim: To analyze interventions of emergency medical teams during the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic, and to compare obtained data with the same periods in 2018-2019. PATIENTS AND METHODS Material and methods: The study retrospectively analyzed interventions of emergency medical teams in the period from 15.03 to 15.05 in 2018 - 2020. 1,479,530 interventions of emergency medical teams were included in the study. The number of interventions, reasons for calls, and diagnoses made by heads of the emergency medical teams during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were compared to the same period in 2018-2019. RESULTS Results: Authors observed the decline in the number of interventions performed by emergency medical teams during the pandemic in relation to earlier years by approximately 25%. The big decline concerned interventions that were the reason for calls to public places, such as \\"traffic accident\\" and \\"collapse\\". In the case of diagnoses made by the head of the emergency medical team, the diagnoses regarding stroke or sudden cardiac arrest remained at the similar level. Others showed a marked decline.

At the start of the coronavirus pandemic we incorporated FIT testing into our department's urgent referral pathway for patients with suspected colorectal cancer. This aimed to triage those symptomatic patients who required urgent investigation and those who were unlikely to have significant colorectal pathology and therefore could have investigations delayed until it was safer and endoscopy services had recovered capacity. This study aimed to identify the diagnostic accuracy of FIT in this setting. Methods/Interventions: Patients referred to our institution under our urgent cancer referral pathway between 28th April and 19th June 2020 were identified from a prospectively kept database. FIT results were accessed from electronic laboratory records. Results were analysed using a threshold of 10ug/ml and the current screening threshold in England of 120ug/ml. Patient outcomes were determined by electronic patient records. Significant polyps included polyps greater than 10mm or meeting British Society of Gastroenterology high risk criteria. Results/Outcome(s): 373 patients were referred to the colorectal department during the study period. 24 referrals did not meet urgent referral criteria. 202 (54%) patients had FIT performed by their general practitioner and 47 (13%) patients had FIT undertaken in the colorectal clinic. In patients who had FIT, 97 (41%) patients had a FIT result less than 10ug/ml and 193 (81%) patients had FIT less than 120ug/ml. 25 (10%) patients were not investigated further based on FIT result and 16 (6%) patients declined further investigation. 13 (3%) patients in the cohort were subsequently investigated and diagnosed with a colorectal cancer (FIT range 24-8438ug/ml). One patient was diagnosed with a gastric cancer (FIT 259ug/ml) and two other patients had incidental findings of other nongastrointestinal cancers. 9 (4%) and 19 (8%) patients had significant colonic polyps and colitis respectively. Other diagnoses included bleeding gastric ulcer (2), angiodysplasia (1) and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (1). In this symptomatic cohort, with a threshold of 10ug/ml the sensitivity of FIT was 100% and specificity of 36% for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. At the 120ug/ml threshold the sensitivity was 77% and the specificity 81% for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Conclusions/Discussion: Incorporating FIT to triage symptomatic patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer is feasible with acceptable levels of diagnostic accuracy when utilizing a threshold of 10ug/ml. FIT testing will continue to be incorporated into our urgent cancer referral pathway, although general practitioners may still refer patients with a negative FIT but high clinical suspicion. Further work will continue to audit the use of FIT in this symptomatic setting.","output":"Sensitivity and specificity of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for patients referred with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Preoperative knowledge of a patient's individual variations in facial artery anatomy would benefit plastic surgeons for reconstructive planning. The authors evaluated the feasibility of multislice computed tomographic angiography in vascular mapping of the facial artery. METHODS In total, 187 facial arteries in 94 patients without facial tumor or vascular disease were studied. Anatomical variations of the facial artery were classified into four types: type 1, a short course that terminates proximal to the superior labial artery; type 2, an intermediate course that terminates distal to the superior labial artery near the nasolabial fold; type 3, a classic course that extends to the lateral nasal ala beyond the nasolabial fold with an angular branch; and type 4, duplex with dominant lateral angular branch. Facial artery patterns were compared with dominant patterns of the facial-submental artery bifurcation. The extent of the inferior and superior labial artery was evaluated separately. RESULTS Sixty-four facial artery branches (34 percent) were classified as type 1, 74 (40 percent) as type 2, and 45 (24 percent) as type 3. Type 4 was seen in only four branches (2 percent). The facial artery was dominant in the facial-submental artery bifurcation in 84 percent of type 3 facial arteries. Three-dimensional volume-rendered images allow detailed visualization of the facial artery and its branches and help preoperative mapping. CONCLUSION Facial computed tomographic angiography allows detailed visualization of the facial artery and its branches and is a potential noninvasive imaging tool for preoperative vascular mapping for facial reconstructive operations.","output":"Evaluation of the facial artery on computed tomographic angiography using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography: implications for facial reconstruction in plastic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections by DNA viruses during pregnancy are associated with increased health risks to both mother and fetus.

Few communication skills interventions target implicit bias as a factor contributing to disparities in health outcomes. We report the protocol from the COmmuNity-engaged SimULation Training for Blood Pressure Control (CONSULT-BP), a trial evaluating a novel educational and training intervention targeting graduate medical and nursing trainees that is designed to mitigate the effects of implicit bias in clinical encounters. The CONSULT-BP intervention combines knowledge acquisition, bias awareness, and practice of bias mitigating skills in simulation-based communication encounters with racially/ethnically diverse standardized patients. The trial evaluates the effect of this 3-part program on patient BP outcomes, self-reported patient medication adherence, patient-reported quality of provider communication, and trainee bias awareness. METHODS: We are conducting a cluster randomized trial of the intervention among cohorts of internal medicine (IM), family medicine (FM), and nurse practitioner (NP) trainees at a single academic medical center. We are enrolling entire specialty cohorts of IM, FM, and NP trainees over a 3-year period, with each academic year constituting an intervention cycle. There are 3 cycles of implementation corresponding to 3 sequential academic years. Within each academic year, we randomize training times to 1 of 5 start dates using a stepped wedge design. The stepped wedge design compares outcomes within training clusters before and after the intervention, as well as across exposed and unexposed clusters. Primary outcome of blood pressure control is measured at the patient-level for patients clustered within trainees. Eligible patients for outcomes analysis are: English-speaking; non-White racial/ethnic minority; Medicaid recipient (regardless of race/ethnicity); hypertension; not have pregnancy, dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or other serious comorbidities that would interfere with hypertension self-control; not enrolled in hospice. Secondary outcomes include trainee bias awareness. A unique feature of this trial is the engagement of academic and community stakeholders to design, pilot test and implement a training program addressing healthcare.

Online research strategies may be necessary for various reasons such as when working with a geographically distributed research team, when conducting research with students in an online program, or when resources are inaccessible due to campus closures like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed a three-stage process during qualitative analysis of the videos that included planning and setup, online analysis of videos, and structural coding of memos to explore patterns across the data. Analysis was conducted with a combination of technologies including Google Drive for collaborative coding online and NVivo to collate and summarize findings. The methods and process we describe are readily applicable to other research studies that include video as part of the data set.

The agents responsible for these infections can be viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi. Among the viruses most frequently responsible for congenital infections are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex 1-2, Herpes virus 6, Varicella zoster. Moreover Hepatitis B and C virus, HIV, Parvovirus B19 and non-polio Enteroviruses when contracted during pregnancy may involve the fetus or newborn at birth. Recently, new viruses have emerged, SARS-Cov-2 and Zika virus, of which we do not yet fully know the characteristics and pathogenic power when contracted during pregnancy. Viral infections in pregnancy can damage the fetus (spontaneous abortion, fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation) or the newborn (congenital anomalies, organ diseases with sequelae of different severity). Some risk factors specifically influence the incidence of transmission to the fetus: the timing of the infection in pregnancy, the order of the infection, primary or reinfection or chronic, the duration of membrane rupture, type of delivery, socio-economic conditions and breastfeeding. Frequently infected neonates, symptomatic at birth, have worse outcomes than asymptomatic. Many asymptomatic babies develop long term neurosensory outcomes. The way in which the virus interacts with the maternal immune system, the maternal-fetal interface and the placenta explain these results and also the differences that are observed from time to time in the fetal-neonatal outcomes of maternal infections. The maternal immune system undergoes functional adaptation during pregnancy, once thought as physiological immunosuppression. This adaptation, crucial for generating a balance between maternal immunity and fetus, is necessary to promote and support the pregnancy itself and the growth of the fetus. When this adaptation is upset by the viral infection, the balance is broken, and the infection can spread and lead to the adverse outcomes previously described. In this review we will describe the main viral harmful infections in pregnancy and the potential mechanisms of the damages on the fetus and newborn.","output":"Pregnancy and viral infections: Mechanisms of fetal damage, diagnosis and prevention of neonatal adverse outcomes from cytomegalovirus to SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the results of research conducted on a representative sample of Polish society and concerning their attitudes towards energy policy, the role and importance of coal, the preferred energy model and the future of Upper Silesia, which is the largest active coal basin in Europe The context of the COVID 19 pandemic, which caused high morbidity among miners, popularised the challenge of energy transition in Poland, where energy continues to be largely based on coal The authors defend the thesis that the main lines of conflict regarding the demand to move away from coal are political and ideological at the level of public opinion The advocates of the coal status quo are supporters of the right-wing populist Law and Justice (PiS) and Confederation (Konfederacja) parties Left-wing and liberal groups are most conducive to energy transition and ecological demands Residents of large cities, as well as better educated and less religious people are more open to energy transition Despite the divisions regarding the date of abandoning coal in Poland, there is social agreement that the government should financially support the activities transforming Upper Silesia into a region producing clean energy","output":"Coal basin in Upper Silesia and energy transition in Poland in the context of pandemic: The socio-political diversity of preferences in energy and environmental policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extant research is growing in its ability to explain sex differences in novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis and mortality. Moving beyond comparisons based on biological sex is now warranted to capture a more nuanced picture of disparities in COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality specifically among men who are more likely to die of the illness. The objective of this study was to investigate racial disparities in COVID-19-related psychosocial, behavior and health variables among men. The present study utilizes a sample of 824 men who participated in a free health event held in a Midwestern state. Chi-square analysis showed that African American men were more likely to report an adverse impact of COVID-19 based on several factors including experiencing more COVID-19-related medical issues (&#967;2 = 4.60 p = 0.03); higher COVID-19 diagnosis (&#967;2 = 4.60 p = 0.02); trouble paying for food (&#967;2 = 8.47, p = 0.00), rent (&#967;2 = 12.26, p = 0.00), medication (&#967;2 = 7.10 p = 0.01) and utility bills (&#967;2 = 19.68, p = 0.00); higher fear of contracting COVID-19 (&#967;2 = 31.19, p = 0.00); and higher rates of death of close friends and family due to COVID (&#967;2 = 48.85, p = 0.00). Non-Hispanic white men reported more increased stress levels due to COVID-19 compared to African American men (&#967;2 = 10.21, p = 0.01). Regression analysis showed that race was a significant predictor of self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 2.56, p < 0.05) after controlling for demographic characteristics. The results showed that compared to non-Hispanic White men, African American men were more likely to report an adverse impact of COVID-19 based on several factors including experiencing more COVID-19-related medical issues; higher COVID-19 diagnosis; trouble paying for food, rent, medication and utility bills; higher fear of contracting COVID-19; and higher rates of death of close friends and family due to COVID.

It was an ecological study utilising spatiotemporal analysis techniques that included all deaths confirmed by COVID-19 in Sergipe, from 2 April to 14 June 2020. Mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority among a??60 years old (62%) and males (53%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). An increasing mortality trend across the state was observed, with a higher increase in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside. Therefore, the use of spatial analysis techniques may contribute to surveillance and control of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 mortality in an area of northeast Brazil: epidemiological characteristics and prospective spatiotemporal modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers have shown an interest in the aggregated Big Five personality of U.S. states, but typically they have relied on scores from a single sample (Rentfrow, Gosling, & Potter, 2008).

Objectives: We present the co-design process used to create a competency-based education program for the healthcare workforce that ensures a person-centered focus on FCGs and introduce our Health Workforce Caregiver-Centered Care Education. Approach: Co-design is the act of creating with stakeholders to ensure useable results that meet stakeholders needs. We began by coining the concept caregiver-centered care, defined as a collaborative working relationship between families and healthcare providers aimed at supporting FCGs in their caregiving role, decisions about care management, and advocacy. From this definition we co-designed, then validated the Caregiver-Centered Care Competency Framework in a Delphi Process. Stakeholders (n= 101) including FCGs, providers, policy makers, community organizations, researchers, and educational designers then used effective practices for health workforce education to co-design the foundational level of a Caregiver Centered Care education. RESULTS: Teaching and learning resources include six competency-aligned educational modules with videos and interactive exercises that encourage reflection. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved the education online (caregivercare.ca). In the first four months online, 815healthcare providers completed the education. We continue to use mixed methods to evaluate the Caregiver-Centered Care Education, for acceptability and effectiveness, in five care contexts (primary, acute, home, supportive living, long-term care).

This study aims to use the case of blockchain to evaluate whether the five characteristics determined from the literature to be required for effective digital risk resilience (specifically, integration, flexibility, reliability, relevance, and timeliness) have an impact on effectiveness in addressing the requirements of the European Unions proposed Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). To achieve this, we developed a survey with 29 statements, which participants were required to answer using a five-point Likert scale. In total, 513 valid responses were received from participants. These were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results show that in the case of blockchain, reliability, flexibility, and relevance were found to significantly relate to its effectiveness in addressing DORAs requirements, but relationships of effectiveness with integration and timeliness were found to be insignificant. However, when the experience variable was added to the model as the moderator variable, we found that timeliness and relevance have a significant relationship with blockchain effectiveness, while integration, reliability, and flexibility do not.","output":"The Perceived Effectiveness of Blockchain for Digital Operational Risk Resilience in the European Union Insurance Market Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversial.

This study examined sociodemographic and risk factors of PCV13 infant primary series vaccination completion, before and during COVID. METHODS: Retrospective data from the Optums de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database were used to create 3 cohorts: C1, Pre-COVID; C2, During COVID; C3, Cross-COVID (Figure 1). C1 and C3 (C1&3) were combined and compared with C2 for primary dosing completion before and during COVID according to infant/caregiver characteristics. Full completion (FC) was defined as receipt of 3 doses of PCV13 within 8 months of birth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare FC vs. partial completion or no vaccine. Descriptive analyses were used to compare FC before and during COVID within subgroups. Figure 1: Study population and inclusion criteria [Image: see text] RESULTS: A total of 132,183 and 16,522 infants with at least 8 months of follow up time were enrolled in C1&3 and C2, respectively. FC was significantly higher before COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17). Adjusting for COVID, FC was significantly lower in infants who were Black, with co-morbidities or risk factors, living in households with >1 children or no children, household annual income < &99k, residing in a neighborhood with median education of high school or below, and whose primary caregiver was aged <25 years (Table 1). Comparing FC before and during COVID, the % decline relative to pre-COVID was > 2% among infants who were White, residing in the Mountain, New England or Pacific regions, in a household with 2 children, >&100k annual income, employer-based insurance or HMO, and median neighborhood education of bachelor degree plus (Table 2).

Across three studies, we developed an 8-item measure of unnerved feelings, finding that it was discriminable from other affective experiences. In Study 1, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis that yielded two factors; an unnerved factor, which connects to emotional reactions to the uncanny, and a disoriented factor, which connects to mental state changes more distally following uncanny experiences. Focusing on the unnerved measure, Study 2 tests the scale's convergent and discriminant validity, concluding that participants who watched an uncanny video were more unnerved than those who watched a disgusting, fearful, or a neutral video. In Study 3, we determined that our scale detects unnerved feelings created during early 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic; a distinct source of uncanniness.

This has led to the discovery that many respiratory infections are caused by more than one virus. Antiviral treatment of viral coinfections can be complex because treatment of one virus will affect the time course of the other virus. Since effective antivirals are only available for some respiratory viruses, careful consideration needs to be given on the effect treating one virus will have on the dynamics of the other virus, which might not have available antiviral treatment. In this study, we use mathematical models of viral coinfections to assess the effect of antiviral treatment on coinfections. We examine the effect of the mechanism of action, relative growth rates of the viruses, and the assumptions underlying the interaction of the viruses. We find that high antiviral efficacy is needed to suppress both infections. If high doses of both antivirals are not achieved, then we run the risk of lengthening the duration of coinfection or even of allowing a suppressed virus to replicate to higher viral titers.","output":"Treatment of Respiratory Viral Coinfections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose an out-of-sample prediction approach that combines unrestricted mixed-data sampling with machine learning (mixed-frequency machine learning, MFML).

The messenger has also been crucial to protest movements in several countries in 2019-2020, including Belarus, Russia and Hong Kong. Yet, to date only few studies examined online activities on Telegram and none have analyzed the platform with regard to the protest mobilization. In the present study, we address the existing gap by examining Telegram-based activities related to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. With this paper we aim to provide an example of methodological tools that can be used to study protest mobilization and coordination on Telegram. We also contribute to the research on computational text analysis in Cantoneseone of the low-resource Asian languages,as well as to the scholarship on Hong Kong protests and research on social media-based protest mobilization in general. For that, we rely on the data collected through Telegrams API and a combination of network analysis and computational text analysis. We find that the Telegram-based network was cohesive ensuring efficient spread of protest-related information. Content spread through Telegram predominantly concerned discussions of future actions and protest-related on-site information (i.e., police presence in certain areas). We find that the Telegram network was dominated by different actors each month of the observation suggesting the absence of one single leader. Further, traditional protest leadersthose prominent during the 2014 Umbrella Movement,such as media and civic organisations were less prominent in the network than local communities. Finally, we observe a cooldown in the level of Telegram activity after the enactment of the harsh National Security Law in July 2020.

The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.","output":"Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases: A data-driven analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This collection of contributions from the European Network on Understanding Gastrointestinal Absorption-related Processes (UNGAP) community assembly aims to provide information on some of the current and newer methods employed to study the behaviour of medicines. It is the product of interactions in the immediate pre-Covid period when UNGAP members were able to meet and set up workshops and to discuss progress across the disciplines. UNGAP activities are divided into work packages that cover special treatment populations, absorption processes in different regions of the gut, the development of advanced formulations and the integration of food and pharmaceutical scientists in the food-drug interface. This involves both new and established technical approaches in which we have attempted to define best practice and highlight areas where further research is needed. Over the last months we have been able to reflect on some of the key innovative approaches which we were tasked with mapping, including theoretical, in silico, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo, preclinical and clinical approaches. This is the product of some of us in a snapshot of where UNGAP has travelled and what aspects of innovative technologies are important. It is not a comprehensive review of all methods used in research to study drug dissolution and absorption, but provides an ample panorama of current and advanced methods generally and potentially useful in this area. This collection starts from a consideration of advances in a priori approaches: an understanding of the molecular properties of the compound to predict biological characteristics relevant to absorption. The next four sections discuss a major activity in the UNGAP initiative, the pursuit of more representative conditions to study lumenal dissolution of drug formulations developed independently by academic teams. They are important because they illustrate examples of in vitro simulation systems that have begun to provide a useful understanding of formulation behaviour in the upper GI tract for industry. The Leuven team highlights the importance of the physiology of the digestive tract, as they describe the relevance of gastric and intestinal fluids on the behaviour of drugs along the tract. This provides the introduction to microdosing as an early tool to study drug disposition. Microdosing in oncology is starting to use gamma-emitting tracers, which provides a link through SPECT to the next section on nuclear medicine.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a recurrent aneurysm treated with a Willis covered stent because of a membrane partially isolated with the stent. This case suggests that an aneurysm that is treated with a Willis covered stent might recanalise, and the risk of aneurysm rupture persists when the membrane of the stent is isolated with the stent. Therefore, follow-up angiography is necessary, even if an immediate angiogram shows complete aneurysm occlusion.

Descriptive and comparative statistical approaches were applied to summarize the data and to determine differences in scores between diagnoses, gender, and developmental functioning. RESULTS Two hundred patients and caregivers participated in BMP during the study period. PSS scores were significantly higher for caregivers of patients with IC than ARM. Statistical differences in SDQ were found for patients with IC versus those with ARM, male versus female patients, and patients with developmental delays versus those without delays. No significant differences were found in SDQ-S scores between these groups. CONCLUSION Key findings suggest that level of parental stress and behavioral concerns were significantly influenced by diagnoses, and partly by gender and presence of developmental delay.

This study aims at estimating the prevalence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and their associated factors among health professionals (HPs) vaccinated with COVISHIELD(TM) vaccine in Togo. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 13th to 19th, 2021 in Togo among HPs who received the first dose of vaccine. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination. SAEs were defined as one resulting in hospitalization, medical consultation, or inability to work the day following the administration of the vaccine. Regression analysis were performed to assess factors associated with SAEs. Results: A total of 1,639 HP (70.2% male) with a median age [IQR] of 32 years [27-40] participated. At least one AE was reported among 71.6% (95%CI= [69.3-73.8]). The most commonly reported AEs were pain at the injection site (91.0%), asthenia (74.3%), headache (68.7%), soreness (55.0%), and fever (47.5%). An increased libido was also reported in 3.0% of HP. Among HP who experienced AEs, 18.2% were unable to go to work the day after vaccination, 10.5% consulted a medical doctor, and 1.0% were hospitalized. The SAE prevalence was 23.8% (95%CI= [21.8-25.9]). Being <30 years (aOR=5.54; p<0.001), or 30-49 years (aOR=3.62; p<0.001) and being female (aOR=1.97; p<0.001) were associated with SAEs.

METHODS: All patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department, Dijon University Hospital, Dijon, France between 27 February and 30 April 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Clinical, biological and radiological data were collected, as well as treatment and outcome data. An unfavourable outcome was defined as death or transfer to the intensive care unit. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients who did and did not receive antibiotic therapy using propensity score matching. FINDINGS: Among the 222 patients included, 174 (78%) received antibiotic therapy. The univariate analysis showed that patients who received antibiotic therapy were significantly older, frailer and had more severe presentation at admission compared with patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy. Unfavourable outcomes were more common in patients who received antibiotic therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-8.11; P = 0.04]. Multi-variate analysis and propensity score matching indicated that antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with outcome (HR 1.612, 95% CI 0.562-4.629; P = 0.37).

The current surge in infection rates around the globe is driven by the variant of concern (VoC) omicron (B.1.1.529). Here, we evaluated the performance of nine SARS-CoV-2 RATs in a single-centre laboratory study. We examined a total of 115 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative and 166 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive respiratory swab samples (101 omicron, 65 delta (B.1.617.2)) collected from October 2021 until January 2022 as well as cell culture-expanded clinical isolates of both VoCs. In an assessment of the analytical sensitivity in clinical specimen, the 50% limit of detection (LoD50) ranged from 1.77  10(6) to 7.03  10(7) RNA copies subjected to the RAT for omicron compared to 1.32  10(5) to 2.05  10(6) for delta. To score positive in these point-of-care tests, up to 10-fold (LoD50) or 101-fold (LoD95) higher virus loads were required for omicron- compared to delta-containing samples. The rates of true positive test results for omicron samples in the highest virus load category (Ct values < 25) ranged between 31.4 and 77.8%, while they dropped to 0C8.3% for samples with intermediate Ct values (25C30). Of note, testing of expanded virus stocks suggested a comparable RAT sensitivity of both VoCs, questioning the predictive value of this type of in vitro-studies for clinical performance. Given their importance for national test strategies in the current omicron wave, awareness must be increased for the reduced detection rate of omicron infections by RATs and a short list of suitable RATs that fulfill the minimal requirements of performance should be rapidly disclosed.

The high recurrence rate and metastasis after surgery reduce the survival time of patients. Therefore, assessing the overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy is critical to clinicians clinical decision-making. Conventional hepatocellular carcinoma assessment systems (such as tumor lymph node metastasis and Barcelona clinical hepatocellular carcinoma) are obviously insufficient in assessing the overall survival rate of patients. This research is devoted to the development of nomogram assessment tools to assess the overall survival probability of patients undergoing liver resection. METHODS: We collected the clinical and pathological information of 438 hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing surgery from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, then excluded 87 patients who did not meet inclusion criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on patient characteristics and related pathological factors. Finally, we developed a nomogram model to predict patients prognosis. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of 438 consecutive samples from the TCGA database of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent potentially curative liver resections. Six risk factors were included in the final model. In the training set, the discriminative ability of the nomogram was very good (concordance index = 0.944), and the external verification method (concordance index = 0.962) was used for verification. At the same time, the internal and external calibration of the model was verified, showing that the model was well calibrated. The calibration between the evaluation of the nomogram and the actual observations was good. According to the patients risk factors, we determined the patients Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis curve. Finally, the clinical decision curve was used to compare the benefits of two different models in evaluating patients clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram can be used to evaluate the post-hepatectomy 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers > 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for > 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg/dL vs. 1.63 mg/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng/mL vs. 0.13 ng/mL).

Preoperative demographic features, imaging characteristics, and laboratory indexes of the patients were collected. Five machine learning algorithms were used: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multilayer perception. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We also determined the Shapley Additive exPlanation value to explain the influence of each feature on the MVI prediction model. RESULTS: The top six important preoperative factors associated with MVI were the maximum image diameter, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, -fetoprotein level, satellite nodules, alanine aminotransferase (AST)/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and AST level, according to the XGBoost model. The XGBoost model for preoperative prediction of MVI exhibited a better AUC (0.8, 95% confidence interval: 0.74C0.83) than the other prediction models. Furthermore, to facilitate use of the model in clinical settings, we developed a user-friendly online calculator for MVI risk prediction based on the XGBoost model. CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model achieved outstanding performance for non-invasive preoperative prediction of MVI based on big data. Moreover, the MVI risk calculator would assist clinicians in conveniently determining the optimal therapeutic remedy and ameliorating the prognosis of patients with HCC.","output":"A Promising Preoperative Prediction Model for Microvascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on an Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Co-occurring substance use disorder is common among pregnant and parenting women with mental illness, but their engagement with and utilization of relevant services and treatment is low. Social media has the potential to convey benefits and facilitate engagement among this target group. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the reach and engagement of specific social media posts among pregnant women and mothers with substance use disorders. METHODS: Eighteen posts providing content related to substance use (cannabis, opioids, or alcohol), varying in type of content (informational or experiential) and target (policy-, practice-, or perception-related), were posted in a closed Facebook community page comprising over 33,000 pregnant women and mothers between May 2019 and October 2019. RESULTS: The overall level of reach of these Facebook posts ranged from 453 to 3045 community members. Engagement levels, measured via the number of likes, comments, or posts shared, varied based on the type of post content (ie, informational or experiential).

Yet, opportunities to perform both functions concurrently for the same population are scarce. Residents must also master the art of preventive medicine, but they often lack an established community of practice that provides a continuous forum to do so. This project explored Population Health Rounds as a novel vehicle to optimize preventive medicine residency training. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Modeled after traditional medical rounds, Population Health Rounds consist of a 1-hour weekly meeting engaging preventive medicine residents and supervising attendings at Stony Brook Medicine in both population medicine and clinical preventive medicine concurrently, including patient case discussions and targeted population health analytics. EVALUATION AND RESULTS: Because of the pandemic, the rounds have predominantly focused on COVID-19 and its effects on the hospital employee population. In addition to providing direct patient care to COVID-19-positive and exposed employees, residents have analyzed data on this population and made recommendations to hospital leadership based on COVID-19's institutional epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors. A formative qualitative survey of resident perceptions offers insights on the value and learning outcomes of this new model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Factors that may impact the implementation, sustainability, and feasibility of this model are discussed. The preventive medicine residency program is commissioned to address gaps in clinical preventive services for the patient-centered medical home tied to the sponsoring institution's family medicine practice. Additional plans are underway to expand the rounds to other clinical contexts, such as lifestyle medicine in the occupational setting, and for targeted populations, such as the underserved. Replication of the Population Health Rounds model is recommended to determine its effectiveness.","output":"Population Health Rounds: A Novel Vehicle for Training in Population Medicine and Clinical Preventive Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Reconstruction of the digestive tract involving esophageal anastomosis after laparoscopic gastrectomy is a surgically difficult procedure. In this study, a newly developed transoral pretilted circular anvil, a \\"the oral to the abdomen\\" method, was proven to be effective. METHOD A total of 34 consecutive patients underwent esophageal anastomosis using the OrVil in our hospital from July 2009 to February 2011. The esophagus was transected and a small hole was then made in the esophageal stump through which the nasogastric tube of the OrVil was passed to insert the anvil into the abdominal cavity. After fixation with a stapler and a glove at the jejunal loop or the remnant stomach, the abdominal cavity was entered through the minilaparotomy. Pneumoperitoneum and airtightness were reestablished after the glove edge was turned over to seal off the protector. Eventually, intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy was accomplished under the guidance of laparoscopy. RESULTS There were 34 patients in the study: 1 with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 7 with stromal tumors in cardia, 23 with adenocarcinoma in the stomach, and 3 with cardia adenocarcinoma involving the lower esophagus. The surgical margins for all tumor patients were negative for tumor cells. The mean operative time was 175.0 minutes (90 to 240 min) and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 195.6 mL (50 to 800 mL). The 34 patients underwent successful laparoscopic surgeries with no open conversions. For 32 patients, there were no technological complications in the transoral insertion of the anvil to the esophageal stump. There were no anastomotic leaks after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS The use of the OrVil device, a \\"the oral to the abdomen\\" method, changes the direction of the anvil insertion and significantly decreases both difficulty and duration of the laparoscopic surgery. More importantly, if the mass is at a higher position, this approach can achieve a higher surgical margin compared with the hand-sewn purse-string suture technique, thus avoiding the need to undergo a thoracotomy (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLE/A83).","output":"A modified technique for esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy after laparoscopic gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Management of cancer patients in the current era of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses significant challenges on health-care systems. However, it is mandatory to keep the required level of care of cancer patients while taking the necessary precautions to maintain the safety of both patients and health-care professionals (HCPs). The present survey explores suggested modifications of inpatient oncology/hematology care during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire using SurveyMonkey was distributed to HCPs taking care of inpatient hematology/oncology service including oncologists, hematologists, and inpatient nurses in Saudi Arabia. The 25 items selected for the survey focused on five domains including characteristics of HCPs, COVID-19 infection risk among admitted patients, possible modifications related to physicians/nursing practice, and suggested infection control measures. Clinical sensibility assessment was conducted to evaluate the comprehensiveness, clarity, and face validity of our instrument on a scale of 1C5. The percentages of HCP responses to the suggested modifications in the survey were assessed in descriptive statistics to summarize data and report views of participants. RESULTS: Of 215 HCPs, 195 responded and completed the survey. Of the respondents, 30.4% were medical oncologists, whereas hematologists and nurses constituted 6.7% and 62.9% of the participants, respectively. The majority of respondents (87.6%) work in governmental hospitals. The majority of participants (82%) have diagnosed patients with COVID-19 in their hospitals and modifications in inpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic were supported by 95% of respondents. The supported modifications by participants include enhanced use of oral medications (83.5%), phone calls to admitted stable patients by physicians, instead of physical interview (77%), decreasing frequency of vital signs assessment in stable patients (91%), decreasing the duration of stay in patients rooms (89%), using peripheral instead of central lines (76%), using video-based educational materials to patients through hospital TV network (91%), testing for COVID -19 before scheduled radiology imaging and procedures (74%), and performing routine nasopharyngeal swabs for HCPs (67%). CONCLUSION: Several modifications in inpatient oncology/hematology practice were supported by the survey participants. These suggestions need to be discussed on local basis considering local infrastructure, available resources, and level of required care.","output":"Suggested modifications in oncology/hematology inpatient service in Saudi Arabia during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Previous research has suggested that some COVID-19 infections and deaths have gone unrecorded, especially in the early days of the pandemic. Therefore, it is likely that people in Massachusetts were exposed to, infected with, and died from COVID-19 before the first death was recorded and that other deaths in early 2020 may have been due to COVID-19, but were not coded that way. This study sought to determine the number of deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 that may have been due to COVID-19, by comparing deaths with selected ICD-10 codes to the same time frame in 2019 and 2018. Methods Death certificate information was obtained for the first 21 weeks of 2018, 2019, and 2020. We calculated and compared the number of deaths for specific ICD-10 codes that may be related to COVID-19 during this time period for each year. Results There was a notable increase in deaths potentially related to COVID-19 between the 11th and 17th weeks of 2020 in comparison with the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Conclusions Even after Massachusetts began recording deaths as being due to COVID-19, the number of deaths that may have been due to the disease was higher than would have been expected based on data from the two preceding years. These findings may indicate that some COVID-19 deaths were not being recorded or that the pandemic was exacerbating other health issues.","output":"Increase in Massachusetts deaths with ICD-10 codes associated with COVID-19 during the first four months of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unprecedented workflow shifts during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have contributed to delays in acute care delivery, but whether it adversely affected endovascular thrombectomy metrics in acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of observational data from 14 comprehensive stroke centers in nine US states with acute LVO. EVT metrics were compared between March to July 2019 against March to July 2020 (primary analysis), and between state-specific pre-peak and peak COVID-19 months (secondary analysis), with multivariable adjustment. RESULTS: Of the 1364 patients included in the primary analysis (51% female, median NIHSS 14 [IQR 7-21], and 74% of whom underwent EVT), there was no difference in the primary outcome of door-to-puncture (DTP) time between the 2019 control period and the COVID-19 period (median 71 vs 67 min, P=0.10). After adjustment for variables associated with faster DTP, and clustering by site, there remained a trend toward shorter DTP during the pandemic (?adj=-73.2, 95% CI -153.8-7.4, Pp=0.07). There was no difference in DTP times according to local COVID-19 peaks vs pre-peak months in unadjusted or adjusted multivariable regression (?adj=-3.85, 95% CI -36.9-29.2, P=0.80).

However, the underlying mechanism of the relationship between childhood trauma and NSSI is limited. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for NSSI among Chinese adolescents. Our hypothesis was that psychological sub-health (PSH) played a mediating role between childhood trauma and NSSI. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Sub-health Questionnaire of Adolescent, and the self-report NSSI were used to measure childhood trauma, PSH, and NSSI. Structural equation model (SEM) was performed to verify our hypothesis. The results showed that 33.9% of the participants in our survey had engaged in NSSI in the past year. Adolescents who were left-behind children or in primary schools were more likely to engage in NSSI. Additionally, 56.2% of the participants had moderate to severe childhood trauma, and 26.1% of the participants had PSH. Furthermore, childhood trauma and PSH would increase the risk of NSSI by 2 times (B = 0.79, p < 0.01) and 5 times (B = 1.64, p < 0.01), respectively. SEM was established (p = 0.512) and the goodness-of-fit indices were examined (CMIN/DF = 0.892; GFI = 0.997; AGFI = 0.992; NFI = 0.991; RFI = 0.980; IFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.00; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA < 0.001). The SEM indicated that childhood trauma positively predicted NSSI both directly and indirectly through PSH. PSH has been confirmed to have partial mediating effects between childhood trauma and NSSI. The assessment of PSH may be an operable and effective method to screen and predict NSSI. Meanwhile, the intervention of childhood trauma and PSH may effectively prevent and reduce the occurrence of NSSI among adolescents.","output":"Childhood Trauma and Non-suicidal Self-Injury Among Chinese Adolescents: The Mediating Role of Psychological Sub-health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On September 2015, a century after Einstein's predictions of their existence, the first gravitational waves (GWs) direct detection was performed by LIGO.

In this ecological study, we explored the association of COVID-19 case rates (per 100,000 people) and death rates (per 100,000 people) with country-level population health characteristics, economic and human development indicators, and habitat-related variables. Methods: To calculate country-level COVID-19 case and death rates, the number of cases and deaths were extracted from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 2020. Country-level population health characteristics, economic and human development indicators, and habitat-related variables were extracted from several publicly available online sources of international organizations. Results were tabulated according to world zones and country economies. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to examine determinants of COVID-19 case rates and death rates. Results: : A total of 187 countries and territories were analyzed, with an aggregate COVID-19 case rate of 779 per 100,000 people, a death rate of 19 per 100,000 people, and a case-fatality rate of 2.4%. For country-level population health characteristics, a higher percentage rate of adults with obesity and a higher percentage rate of adults with high blood pressure was independently associated with a higher COVID-19 case rate, and a higher percentage rate of adults with obesity was associated with a higher COVID-19 death rate. For country-level economic and human development indicators, only a higher gross domestic product percentage rate spent on total health expenditure and a higher human development index was independently associated with a higher COVID-19 case rate and death rate. A higher percentage of urban population was independently associated with a higher COVID-19 death rate, whereas a higher income per capita was independently associated with a lower COVID-19 death rate. For country-level habitat-related variables, a higher average household size and a higher percentage rate of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels and technologies was independently associated with a lower COVID-19 case rate and death rate whereas a higher percentage rate of households with at least one-member age 65 years or over was associated with a higher case rate and death rates. Conclusion: This ecological study informs the need to develop country-specific public health interventions to better target populations at high risk for COVID-19, and test environmental interventions to prevent indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2, taking into consideration population health characteristics, economic and human development indicators, and habitat-related variables that are unique to each country.","output":"Determinants of COVID-19 Case and Death Rates: An Ecological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The coexistence of neurological injury and respiratory failure is common in intensive care.

RESULTS: Participants reported sociocultural factors such as reliance on alternative medicine or religion, lack of education, and financial burden as community-level barriers to CRC screening. At the system level, screening was limited by insufficient access to FOBT as well as a perceived lack of national prioritization. This was described as inadequate efforts from the Ministry of Health regarding national education as well as lack of incorporation of CRC screening into the National Health Insurance Scheme.

This study seeks to determine whether secondary polycythemia among men receiving TT confers an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and venous thromboembolic events (VTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a multi-institutional database of 74 million patients, we identified two cohorts of men with low testosterone (Total T <350ng/dl) who received TT and subsequently either developed polycythemia (N=5887) or did not (N=42784). Polycythemia was defined as hematocrit 52%. As a secondary objective, we identified two cohorts of hypogonadal men without polycythemia, who either did (N=26,880) or did not (N=27,430) receive TT. Our primary outcome was the incidence of MACE and VTE in the first year after starting TT. We conducted a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to assess differences in MACE and VTE survival time, and measured associations following propensity score matching. RESULTS 5,842 men who received TT and developed polycythemia were matched and compared to 5,842 men who did not develop polycythemia. Men with polycythemia had a higher risk of MACE/VTE (number of outcomes: 301, 5.15%) than men who had normal hematocrit (N: 226, 3.87%) while on TT (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.61, p <0.001). In hypogonadal men who received testosterone, no increased risk of MACE and VTE was identified as compared to hypogonadal men na?ve to TT.

It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5  107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1  107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h.

Composite degradable flocculant (CDF) was prepared by cationic polyacrylamide (PAM) grafting onto modified starch with a novel initiator, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The microstructure of flocculated sludge was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The study investigated the properties of CDF compared to PAM, which showed that the prepared CDF exhibited a highly effective flocculation on sludge dewatering, a higher transmittance and chemical oxygen demand removal rate, and a lower value of effluent ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus. The fermentation process was also analyzed by testing the performance of dewatered sludge (temperature, pH, ammonia nitrogen, E4/E6 (humic acid absorbance at 465 nm (E4) and 665 nm (E6))). The dehydrated sludge with CDF could be easily compressed into cakes by belt-filter for easy transportation and storage. With the continuous addition of CDF and PAM, the corresponding index of capillary suction time (CST) increased. Moreover, the total value of CST with CDF was low, showing a good dewaterability. In addition, the sludge index of pumping time and moisture content with CDF were low in contrast with PAM. Fermentation experiments demonstrated that sludge with CDF had a comparatively high temperature and low value of E4/E6.

Ownership of small companion animals, including cats and dogs, is popular within the cystic fibrosis (CF) community. These animals require vaccines as part of their routine care, which may involve live viral and bacterial vaccines, with potential for infection in the CF owner. This report examines the scope of current canine and feline vaccines, with particular emphasis on veterinary vaccination strategies against the Gram-negative pathogen, Bordetella bronchiseptica and describes new vaccine innovations offering protection to both pet and CF owner. COMMENT The Gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella bronchoseptica, may cause respiratory disease in small companion animals, as well as in certain human vulnerable groups, including those with CF. Live licenced veterinary bacterial vaccines for Bordetella bronchiseptica (Kennel Cough) are available for cats and dogs, which are an infection concern for humans with CF who may come into contact with vaccinated animals. Live licenced veterinary bacterial vaccines for Bordetella bronchiseptica (Kennel Cough) are available for intranasal administration to cats and dogs. These vaccines require a withdrawal period of vaccinated animal from vulnerable owner, ranging from 35 days - 11 weeks. Recently, a new dead IM vaccine is now available not requiring exclusion of the vaccinated pet from CF owner. WHAT IS NEW & CONCLUSION CF pharmacists, hospital pharmacists and community pharmacists are important custodians of vaccine-related advice to people with CF, who are frequently consulted for such advice. Pharmacists should be aware of the recent innovations in veterinary medicines, so that they can give appropriate advice to people with CF when asked. Immunocompromised patients, that is those with CF or those with any defect in their phagocytic function (chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, myeloperoxidase deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome) should avoid exposure to live veterinary bacterial vaccines and seek animal vaccination utilising non-live vaccines. Most importantly, this manuscript highlights the development of a new veterinary vaccine for dogs, which we want to make the CF healthcare community aware of, which is an acellular dead vaccine, so that those patients with dogs needing annual vaccination can select this vaccine pathway, thereby minimising risk of infection from the vaccine strains and avoiding the social exclusion between CF patient and their pet. CF patients should understand the potential infection implications of live-attenuated viral and bacterial strains as vaccines, whether these are small companion animals, exotic animals or large farm animals. Patients should make their veterinarian aware of their CF status, so that a safe and efficacious vaccine strategy is used, both mitigating the potential infection risks from live vaccine components with the CF patient, but simultaneously offering maximum immunological protection to the animal.","output":"A doggy tale: Risk of zoonotic infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients from live licenced bacterial veterinary vaccines for cats and dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveIn Japan, healthcare workers (HCWs) are vaccinated against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other contagious viruses (measles, rubella, chickenpox, mumps, and hepatitis B) to prevent nosocomial infection. However, some do not produce sufficient antibodies after vaccination (low responders). This study investigated changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody levels among HCWs after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and assessed whether low responders produced adequate SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and neutralizing antibodies. MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of HCWs before and after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a hospital in Tokyo, Japan. The HCWs received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, 3 weeks apart. Those whose antibody levels against previous antiviral vaccines did not reach protective antibody levels after receiving two doses were defined as low responders, whereas those who produced adequate antibodies were defined as normal responders. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies were measured 11 times from before the first BNT162b2 vaccination to 5 months after the second vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity was measured twice in low responders, 1 week to 1 month and 5 months after the second vaccination. ResultsFifty HCWs were included in the analytic cohort. After vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody was detectable in the samples from both responders at each timepoint, but the level was lower at 5 months than at 1 week after the second vaccination. Low responders had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity 1 week to 1 month after the second vaccination, which exceeded the positive threshold after 5 months. ConclusionAfter BNT162b2 vaccination, low responders acquired adequate SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to prevent SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody levels were lower at 5 months than at 1 week after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in low and normal responders. Therefore, low responders should also receive a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine.","output":"Can individuals with low antibody responses to vaccines against other viruses acquire adequate SARS-CoV-2 antibody after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The PLOS Medicine editors discuss the role of the World Health Organization in pandemic responses.","output":"Pandemic preparedness and responses: WHO to turn to in a crisis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier studies demonstrated that Metarhizium brunneum, usually a broad-host pathogen of arthropods, is unable to complete its pathogenic life cycle when inoculated on the fungus-resistant tick, Hyalomma excavatum engorged females. While the fungus penetrates the cuticle of fungus-susceptible tick, Rhipicephalus annulatus females, it is unable to penetrate the cuticle of fungus-resistant tick, and even perishes on its surface. This is probably due to high concentration of antifungal fatty acids and probably also due to a hypersensitive-like response of the tick. To understand the metabolic pathways occurring in the fungal hyphae upon encountering the cuticles, we compared the response of the fungus to cuticle from susceptible and resistant tick cuticles by 2D-gels. The intracellular proteomes of M. brunneum Mb7 exposed to cuticle of the fungus-susceptible tick, R. annulatus, and to the fungus-resistant tick, H. excavatum engorged females were compared after exposure to either cuticles. By means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry we identified in both proteomes common proteins involved in biological processes as well as unique proteins identified only in the proteome of fungus exposed to fungus-resistant tick cuticle.

METHODS: We sought official academic and institutional publications of any type, published in English and analyzed their approaches to communication used during the pandemic. RESULTS: The factors that might undermine appropriate communication include but are not limited to (a) the exponential increase of COVID-19-related publications, often including biases in the peer-review and editorial process; (b) the role of traditional media; (c) politicization of the virus; and (d) the impact of social media.

It can also drive the spread of infectious diseases and transmissible cancers such as the Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). While disrupting this structure can reduce disease spread, it can also impair host resilience by disrupting gene flow and colonisation dynamics. Using an individual-based metapopulation model we investigated the synergistic effects of host dispersal, disease transmission rate and inter-individual contact distance for transmission, on the spread and persistence of DFTD from local to regional scales. Disease spread, and the ensuing population declines, are synergistically determined by individuals dispersal, disease transmission rate and within-population mixing. Transmission rates can be magnified by high dispersal and inter-individual transmission distance. The isolation of local populations effectively reduced metapopulation-level disease prevalence but caused severe declines in metapopulation size and genetic diversity. The relative position of managed (i.e., isolated) local populations had a significant effect on disease prevalence, highlighting the importance of considering metapopulation structure when implementing metapopulation-scale disease control measures.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models.

METHODS: This study involved a cross-sectional survey of 213 women who were seeking infertility management in January 2021 in Jordan. An electronic questionnaire was designed and validated, which was then distributed on social media platforms. RESULTS: Over half of the participants had experienced some form of voluntary or involuntary disruption of their infertility management journey. The decision to postpone treatment was significantly associated with fear of infection (p = 0.009) and was more likely if they had undergone two or more previous cycles of in vitro fertilization treatment (p = 0.004). The majority of participants agreed that infertility services should remain available during the pandemic for those who chose not to delay their treatment journey, as the delay may have negative financial and psychological implications and may affect the chance to achieve a successful pregnancy in the future.

However, despite their state-of-the-art performance in predictive graph-based applications, recent studies have shown that GNNs can raise significant privacy concerns when graph data contain sensitive information. As a result, in this paper, we study the problem of learning GNNs with Differential Privacy (DP). We propose GAP, a novel differentially private GNN that safeguards the privacy of nodes and edges using aggregation perturbation, i.e., adding calibrated stochastic noise to the output of the GNN's aggregation function, which statistically obfuscates the presence of a single edge (edge-level privacy) or a single node and all its adjacent edges (node-level privacy). To circumvent the accumulation of privacy cost at every forward pass of the model, we tailor the GNN architecture to the specifics of private learning. In particular, we first precompute private aggregations by recursively applying neighborhood aggregation and perturbing the output of each aggregation step. Then, we privately train a deep neural network on the resulting perturbed aggregations for any node-wise classification task. A major advantage of GAP over previous approaches is that we guarantee edge-level and node-level DP not only for training, but also at inference time with no additional costs beyond the training's privacy budget. We theoretically analyze the formal privacy guarantees of GAP using R\\\\'enyi DP.

Analysis of mRNA-LNP structures reveals that mRNA, the ionizable cationic lipid and water are present in the LNP core.

It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized.

This study aimed to excavate more information, such as differences in distribution, density, and severity of pneumonia lesions between males and females in a specific age group using artificial intelligence (AI)-based CT metrics. Besides, these metrics were incorporated into a clinical regression model to predict the short-term outcome. Methods: The clinical, laboratory information and a series of HRCT images from 49 patients, aged from 20 to 50 years and confirmed with COVID-19, were collected. The volumes and percentages of infection (POI) among bilateral lungs and each bronchopulmonary segment were extracted using uAI-Discover-NCP software (version R001). The POI in three HU ranges, (i.e. <-300, -300~49 and 50 HU representing ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed opacity and consolidation), were also extracted. Hospital stay was predicted with several POIs after adjusting days from illness onset to admission, leucocytes, lymphocytes, c-reactive protein, age and gender using a multiple linear regression model. Results: Right lower lobes had the highest POI, followed by left lower lobes, right upper lobes, middle lobes and left upper lobes. The distributions in lung lobes and segments were different between the sexes. Men had a higher total POI and GGO of the lungs, but less consolidation than women in initial CT (all p<0.05).

DESIGN: A modified Delphi methodology was utilized, with 3 electronic voting rounds. AGREE II and an adapted COVID-19 survey framework from physiotherapy were used to develop survey statements. Sixty-six statements pertaining to workforce planning and management of communication and swallowing function in the ICU were included. SETTING: Electronic modified Delphi process. PARTICIPANTS: 35 speech-language pathologists (SLPs) from 6 continents representing 12 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was consensus agreement, defined a priori as &#8805;70% of participants with a mean Likert score &#8805;7.0 (11-point scale: \\"0\\" = strongly disagree, \\"10\\" strongly agree). Prioritization rank order of statements in a 4th round was also conducted. RESULTS: SLPs with a median of 15 years ICU experience, working primarily in clinical (54%), in academic (29%) or managerial (17%) positions, completed all voting rounds. After the third round, 64 statements (97%) met criteria. Rank ordering identified issues of high importance. CONCLUSIONS: A set of global consensus statements to facilitate planning and delivery of rehabilitative care for patients admitted to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic were agreed by an international expert SLP group. Statements focus on considerations for workforce preparation, resourcing and training, and the management of communication and swallowing functions. These statements support and provide direction for all members of the rehabilitation team to use for patients admitted to the ICU during a global pandemic.","output":"A consensus statement for the management and rehabilitation of communication and swallowing function in the ICU: A global response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis is a rare, highly morbid pathological syndrome of vascular calcification and tissue necrosis. It is predominantly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic dialysis. There is no definitive standard of care for calciphylaxis, and the overall prognosis for patients, particularly those with ulcerated lesions, is bleak. One important role of wound care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic is to ensure that the continuity of care of an at-risk population is maintained while limiting the patient's potential exposure to the virus. Innovative therapies paired with alternative treatment sites of service are one such method. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old female with ESRD on at-home peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented to the outpatient wound clinic with a punch biopsy-proven calciphylaxis lesion. Within days, state-wide \\"shelter-at-home\\" orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic went into effect. To prevent disruption in care and to minimize risk to the patient, the lesion was treated with bi-weekly self-application of a continuous topical oxygen therapy (cTOT) device paired with weekly telemedicine visits. The wound completely resolved after 9 weeks of topical oxygen therapy with no complications or device malfunctions. CONCLUSIONS: This case, to the authors' knowledge, is the first to document healing in a calciphylaxis wound with the use of cTOT. Topical oxygen therapy may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment of wounds caused by calciphylaxis. Finding creative ways to navigate this current health care crisis is essential to help mitigate risk for vulnerable patients with advanced comorbidities.","output":"The Use of Topical Oxygen Therapy to Treat a Calciphylaxis Wound During a Global Pandemic: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sickness can change our mood for the worse, leaving us sad, lethargic, grumpy and less socially inclined. This mood change is part of a set of behavioral symptoms called sickness behavior and has features in common with core symptoms of depression. Therefore, the physiological changes induced by immune activation, for example following infection, are in the spotlight for explaining mechanisms behind mental health challenges such as depression. While humans may take a day off and isolate themselves until they feel better, farm animals housed in groups have only limited possibilities for social withdrawal. We suggest that immune activation could be a major factor influencing social interactions in pigs, with outbreaks of damaging behavior such as tail biting as a possible result. The hypothesis presented here is that the effects of several known risk factors for tail biting are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteins produced by the immune system, and their effect on neurotransmitter systems.

The primary outcome was peak antibody titer, assessed as a binary variable (1:2880, which was the highest detected titer, versus lower than 1:2880). In patients with positive serology test, peak titer rates were compared between BMI groups (<18.5, 18.5\\\\25, 25\\\\30, 30\\\\40, 40 kg/m(2)).

Although inflammation is protective, uncontrolled excessive inflammation can cause inflammatory diseases and can be detrimental, such as in COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms that control inflammasome activation are incompletely understood. Here we report that the leucine rich repeat (LRR) protein Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1), which shares homology with LRRs of NLRP proteins, attenuates inflammasome activation. Deletion of RNH1 in macrophages increases IL-1 production and caspase-1 activation for inflammasome stimuli. Mechanistically, RNH1 decreases pro-IL-1 expression and induces proteasome-mediated caspase-1 degradation. Corroborating this, mouse models of monosodium urate (MSU)-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxemia, which are dependent on caspase-1, respectively show increased neutrophil infiltration and lethality in Rnh1-/- mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, RNH1 protein levels are negatively correlated with inflammation and disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may increase alcohol consumption and cause alcohol use disorder. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption, risky drinking (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality) and alcohol use disorder (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality). DATA SOURCES We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic bibliographic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and CISDOC on 30 June 2018. Searches on PubMed were updated on 18 April 2020. We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consulted additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We considered for inclusion randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption (in g/week), risky drinking, and alcohol use disorder (prevalence, incidence or mortality). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from publications related to qualifying studies. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. RESULTS Fourteen cohort studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 104,599 participants (52,107 females) in six countries of three WHO regions (Americas, South-East Asia, and Europe). The exposure and outcome were assessed with self-reported measures in most studies. Across included studies, risk of bias was generally probably high, with risk judged high or probably high for detection bias and missing data for alcohol consumption and risky drinking. Compared to working 35-40 h/week, exposure to working 41-48 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 10.4 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.59-15.20; seven studies; 25,904 participants, I2 71%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working 49-54 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 17.69 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.16-26.22; seven studies, 19,158 participants, I2 82%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working 55 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 16.29 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.93-24.65; seven studies; 19,692 participants; I2 82%, low quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of exposure to working 41-48 h/week, compared with working 35-40 h/week on developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.08; 95% CI 0.86-1.36; 12 studies; I2 52%, low certainty evidence). Working 49-54 h/week did not increase the risk of developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.90-1.39; 12 studies; 3832 participants; I2 24%, moderate certainty evidence), nor working 55 h/week (relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.95-1.30; 12 studies; 4525 participants; I2 0%, moderate certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses indicated that age may influence the association between long working hours and both alcohol consumption and risky drinking. We did not identify studies for which we had access to results on alcohol use disorder. CONCLUSIONS Overall, for alcohol consumption in g/week and for risky drinking, we judged this body of evidence to be of low certainty. Exposure to long working hours may have increased alcohol consumption, but we are uncertain about the effect on risky drinking. We found no eligible studies on the effect on alcohol use disorder. Producing estimates for the burden of alcohol use disorder attributable to exposure to long working hours appears to not be evidence-based at this time.

However, to date, there is no epidemiological data regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Mexico. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and define the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with seroprevalence. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey in Ciudad Guadalupe, NL, Mexico. City government employees voluntarily participated during July 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at the time of blood sampling to analyze the associated characteristics. IgM/IgG antibodies were determined using a qualitative chemiluminescent immunoassay. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical and continuous variables. Statistical significance was tested using the Chi-squared test, Students t-test and the MannCWhitney. Logistic regression models and the odds ratios (adjusted and unadjusted) were used to estimate the association of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 3,268 participants included, 193 (5.9%, 95% CI 5.1C6.8) tested positive for IgM/IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Sex, city of residence, and comorbidities did not show any association with having IgM/IgG antibodies.

The local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the two matched therapies were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify risk factors for LTP and RFS. The therapeutic effects and complications of the two treatments were also compared. RESULTS The LTP, IDR, and RFS of MWA and RFA were equivalent (LTP: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.36- 2.07; P = 0.746, IDR: HR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.61-1.73; P = 0.890, RFS: HR = 1.15; 95% CI 0.69-1.91; P = 0.566). Para-vessel lesions was the only risk factor for LTP, whereas age, previous treatment, Albumin-Bilirubin score, and tumor diameter were risk factors for RFS.

Non clinician staff (e.g. research assistants (RAs), study coordinators, or research trainees) with varying levels of clinical training and experience are typically the primary point of contact for research participants. Consequently, they are often the first to encounter suicidality. This highlights the need for robust virtual suicide risk assessment procedures that are at an appropriate level for research staff and optimized for remote clinical research visits. The current procedures for in-person visits conducted by the Geriatric Psychiatry Program at McLean Hospital require non-clinician staff to complete the full Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) in situations of active suicidal ideation (SI) before requiring clinician notification and intervention. However, staff and clinicians both reported that the virtual visit format limited the quality of the assessment and the ability to respond rapidly in situations of passive suicidal ideation, especially when this ideation did not meet the threshold for clinician notification specified in the in-person protocol. Thus, we established the need for a specific virtual suicide risk assessment protocol. Here we present our process for needs assessment and its findings, which in turn have shaped our revised protocol. Methods We surveyed clinicians and social workers affiliated with the Geriatric Psychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital. The first goal of this survey was to collect information on how clinicians respond to situations of suicidality during telehealth assessments, and how clinicians recommend that staff navigate these situations in a virtual research setting. The second goal was to gather qualitative data that would guide preparatory safety planning (PSP) that non-clinician staff could complete prior to research visits. Because there are no standardized instruments for the information we wanted to collect, we developed a survey based on consensus among research staff. Results Of the 19 clinicians surveyed, 11 completed the brief survey. Nine (81.8%) of the eleven clinicians that responded had needed to deal with a patient at imminent risk of suicide in any setting. Only three (27.27%) clinicians were fully comfortable using the in-person SI protocol for virtual encounters. All 11 (100%) of responding clinicians conveyed that PSP should include information on (a) the exact location of the patient's home, (b) contact information for friends and family, and (c) an assessment of firearm access. The PSP should be completed as early as feasible in the research process, prior to formal enrollment, even if there was no reason to suspect SI at the time. Additional qualitative feedback included recommendations for lowering the threshold for enacting the SOP from subjects expressing active SI to passive SI to facilitate earlier intervention. Clinicians also recommended training staff on formal assessment measures such as the combined SAFE-T (Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage) and CSSRS protocol in a structured interview so that they could conduct a more systematic assessment if passive SI was reported. Conclusions As more research encounters are conducted virtually, protocols designed for in-person assessment of suicide risk must be adapted. We found that the most useful addition to a virtual SI protocol may be to lower the threshold for action from active to passive SI and inclusion of PSP. Our findings also indicate that staff should be trained in standardized suicide assessment and that there should be a low threshold for conducting these assessments (i.e. passive ideation) and notifying clinicians. Our findings may be broadly generalizable to all mental health research settings that involve virtual assessment by non-clinician staff.

The detection and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (lineage B.1.1.529) in Botswana and South Africa became a global concern because it contained 15 mutations in the spike protein immunogenic receptor binding domain and was less neutralized by sera derived from vaccinees compared to the previously dominant Delta variant. To investigate if Omicron is more likely than Delta to cause infections in vaccinated persons, we analyzed 37,877 nasal swab PCR tests conducted from 12-26 December 2021 and calculated the test positivity rates for each variant by vaccination status. We found that the positivity rate among unvaccinated persons was higher for Delta (5.2%) than Omicron (4.5%). We found similar results in persons who received a single vaccine dose. Conversely, our results show that Omicron had higher positivity rates than Delta among those who received two doses within five months (Omicron = 4.7% vs. Delta = 2.6%), two doses more than five months ago (4.2% vs. 2.9%), and three vaccine doses (2.2% vs. 0.9%). Our estimates of Omicron positivity rates in persons receiving one or two vaccine doses were not significantly lower than unvaccinated persons but were 49.7% lower after three doses. In comparison, the reduction in Delta positivity rates from unvaccinated to 2 vaccine doses was 45.6-49.6% and to 3 vaccine doses was 83.2%. Despite the higher positivity rates for Omicron in vaccinated persons, we still found that 91.2% of the Omicron infections in our study occurred in persons who were eligible for 1 or more vaccine doses at the time of PCR testing.

We determine the household-level effects of the COVID-19 shock using income sources, types of industries, communities' resilience, household susceptibility, and relevant policy measures. For this purpose, we used primary data of 555 households collected through snowball sampling technique using an online survey questionnaire from different villages mostly located in Sichuan Province, China. Using step-wise binary logistic regression analysis, we estimated and validated the model. Results suggest the use of SES as a better measure for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on different households. We find that households with low SES tend to depend more on farmland income and transfer payments from the government. Contrarily, high SES households focus more on business and local employment as sources of income generation. Poor households were less resilient and more likely to fall back into poverty due to COVID-19, while the opposite stands true for non-poor households with high SES. Based on the estimations, policies encouraging employment and businesses complemented with loans on lower interest rates are recommended, which may increase the SES, thus minimizing vulnerability and enhancing the households' resilience towards poverty alleviation and economic shocks.","output":"Socio-economic status, resilience, and vulnerability of households under COVID-19: Case of village-level data in Sichuan province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: The weekend warrior has long been prey to musculoskeletal injuries as a result of intermittent, high intensity activity. The Achilles tendon is known to be particularly vulnerable in this population cohort but during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Ireland and all over the world there has been a certain level of detraining and deconditioning among all age groups and populations. Throughout the worldwide restrictions, viral internet challenges and dances have encapsulated the spirit of a global community with the Jerusalema dance being no exception. The rise of this particular viral sensation was at the detriment of the Achilles tendons of three middle aged gentlemen on who we base our case series. PRESENTATION OF CASES: Over the space of ten days three cases of Achilles tendon rupture repair presented to the emergency department in Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore (MRHT) with the mechanism of tendon rupture being through the Jerusalema dance. These patients were surgically managed in line with local institution practice and postoperative outcomes were good with no complications noted. Follow up is ongoing. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This retrospective case series is based on the impact of the Jerusalema Dance on presentations of Achilles tendon rupture to the Emergency Department in a single regional hospital from January to March 2021. We used these cases in conjunction with a review of current literature to highlight the benefit of an integrated Achilles Tendon rehabilitation programme in this at-risk patient cohort. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the dangers inherent when well intentioned, but physically deconditioned individuals endeavour to perform a physical exercise which is deceptively demanding. Going forward, viral challenges such as the Jerusalema may contribute to new and interesting mechanisms of injuries in our weekend warrior cohort. In addition to this, given the global deconditioning seen due to the COVID 19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns we may see a higher rate of Achilles tendon injuries in the near future across a multitude of patient cohorts. Level one evidence suggests that conservative treatment is just as effective as surgical treatments in the majority of patients with an Achilles tendon rupture, as long as a protocol of rehabilitation with early weightbearing is performed. Our accelerated rehabilitation programme in MRHT is in line with others however internal audit and new literature in the future may enable us to refine it further.","output":"Achilles' tendon rupture dancing the Jerusalema C A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While we are still learning more about COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, finding alternative and already available methods to reduce the risk and severity of the disease is paramount. One such option is vitamin D, in the form of vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) supplementation, due to its potential antiviral properties. It has become apparent that older individuals have a greater risk of developing severe COVID-19, and compared to younger adults, the elderly have lower levels of vitamin D due to a variety of biological and behavioral factors. Older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinsons disease (PD), with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor. In addition to its immune-system-modulating effects, it has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing PD progression and improving PD-related quality of life. We completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin D, PD, and COVID-19. We concluded that the daily supplementation of 2000C5000 IU/day of vitamin D(3) in older adults with PD has the potential to slow the progression of PD while also potentially offering additional protection against COVID-19.","output":"Potential Role of Vitamin D in the Elderly to Resist COVID-19 and to Slow Progression of Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of swine epidemic diarrhea. In order to study the pathogenic mechanism of PEDV, PEDV was inoculated into Vero cells cultured in vitro, and the total RNA of Vero cells was extracted to construct a library for Illumina high-throughput sequencing and screening of differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05). Five differentially expressed genes for qRT-PCR verification analysis were randomly selected, and the verification results were consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes screened above. The results showed that the target gene annotations of differentially expressed genes in the African green monkey genome were mainly enriched in the TNF signaling pathway, the P53 signaling pathway, the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and immune inflammation. In addition, it has been reported that Puma can promote apoptosis and is a key mediator of P53-dependent and non-dependent apoptosis pathways. However, there is no report that PEDV infection can activate Puma and induce apoptosis in a P53-dependent pathway. It was found by flow cytometry that PEDV infection induced apoptosis, and by Western Blotting detection, PEDV infection significantly increased the expression of p53, BAX, and Puma apoptosis-related proteins. Treatment Vero cells with the p53 inhibitor, PFT-, could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced apoptosis. Studies have shown that PEDV infection can activate Puma and induce apoptosis in a P53-dependent pathway.

The cellular RNAi machinery can inhibit virus replication, but viruses may also exploit the RNAi machinery for their own replication. In addition, viruses can encode proteins or RNA molecules that suppress existing RNAi pathways or trigger the silencing of specific host genes.

Protein factors responsible for ribosome dimerization in bacteria are well characterized, whereas no information is available for the corresponding factors in archaeal and eukaryotic cells.

The ribosome-associated proteins were prepared by high-salt wash of crude ribosomes, and analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS). Of the detected proteins we focused on a protein (PF0560) whose Protein Score was the highest of all of the function-unknown proteins. PF0560 protein had a pronounced effect on the sedimentation pattern of the 30S ribosomal subunit; addition of this protein to isolated 30S subunit reduced the 30S fraction and increased the amount of the 50S fraction. This increase presumably corresponds to the dimer of the 30S subunit. The PF0560-dependent 30S-dimerization, was also observed by gel electrophoretic analysis. This effect was not observed in EDTA-treated 30S subunit, with protein-free 16S rRNA or with bacterial/eukaryotic ribosomal small subunits. Furthermore, PF0560 protein suppressed the formation of functional 70S ribosomes.

An implementation science framework guides the intervention and allows for examination of the multilevel contexts that promote or impede adoption and expansion of EBPs. The primary outcome, number of opioid overdose deaths, will be compared between Wave 1 and Wave 2 communities during Year 2 of the intervention for Wave 1. Numerous secondary outcomes will be examined. DISCUSSION: The HCS is the largest community-based implementation study in the field of addiction with an ambitious goal of significantly reducing fatal opioid overdoses.","output":"The HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-term (SM)) Communities Study: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Trial at the Community Level to Reduce Opioid Overdose Deaths through Implementation of an Integrated Set of Evidence-based Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored rates of premature births and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions at the Mount Sinai Hospital after the implementation of COVID-19 lockdown measures (March 16, 2020) and phase one reopening (June 8, 2020), comparing them to those of the same time periods from 2012-2019.

This study aimed to evaluate the utility of NPWT in chest masculinization with free nipple graft (FNG). Methods All consecutive male patients undergoing chest masculinization with FNG by a single provider at a single center were reviewed. Postoperative treatment with either NPWT or standard wound care (SWC) defined this study's cohorts. Patient characteristics and postoperative complications were compared between patients receiving NPWT versus SWC. Results One hundred thirty-one patients with 262 closed breast incisions (NPWT=72, SWC=190) met inclusion criteria. Overall complications were higher in the SWC cohort (n=80/190, 42%) compared to the NPWT cohort (n = 13/72, 18%, p < 0.001). The NPWT group had significantly lower rates of partial nipple graft loss (9/72, 12.5% versus 47/190, 24.7%, p = 0.031), seroma formation (1/72, 1.4% versus 15/190, 7.9%, p = 0.037), and nipple hypopigmentation (6/72, 8.3% versus 36/190, 18.9%, p = 0.024) when compared to the SWC cohort. Time to drain removal was significantly faster in the NPWT group (NPWT 7 days versus SWC 9 days, p  0.001). Conclusions Patients receiving NPWT over their closed incisions following chest masculinization with FNG were found to have significantly lower rates of partial nipple graft necrosis, seroma formation, and time to drain removal compared to those receiving SWC.

Although RIG-I and MDA5 have similar molecular structures, these two receptors have distinct features during activation. Further, the signaling domains of the N terminal CARD domains (CARDs) in RIG-I and MDA5 share poor similarity. Therefore, we wonder whether the CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 play similar roles in signaling and antiviral function. Here we expressed porcine RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs in 293T cells and porcine alveolar macrophages and found that MDA5 CARDs exhibit higher expression and stronger signaling activity than RIG-I CARDs. Nevertheless, both RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs exert comparable antiviral function against several viruses. Transcriptome analysis showed that MDA5 CARDs are more effective in regulating downstream genes. However, in the presence of virus, both RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs exhibit similar effects on downstream gene transcriptions, reflecting their antiviral function.","output":"Porcine RIG-I and MDA5 Signaling CARD Domains Exert Similar Antiviral Function Against Different Viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the application of plan-do-check-action (PDCA) cycle management model in the management outpatient appointment, and improve the efficiency of outpatient appointment services.

An increasing number of studies have indicated that it can modulate critical parameters surrounding viral infections, and yet its role in viral infectivity, pathogenesis, and evolution is just beginning to be appreciated. Aggregation likely promotes viral infection by increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI), which can help overcome stochastic failures of viral infection and genetic defects and subsequently modulate their fitness, virulence, and host responses. Conversely, aggregation can limit the dispersal of viral particles and hinder the early stages of establishing a successful infection. The costCbenefit of viral aggregation seems to vary not only depending on the viral species and aggregating factors but also on the spatiotemporal context of the viral life cycle. Here, we review the knowns of viral aggregation by focusing on studies with direct observations of viral aggregation and mechanistic studies of the aggregation process. Next, we chart the unknowns and discuss the biological implications of viral aggregation in their infection cycle. We conclude with a perspective on harnessing the therapeutic potential of this phenomenon and highlight several challenging questions that warrant further research for this field to advance.","output":"Viral Aggregation: The Knowns and Unknowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), now named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may change the risk of stroke through an enhanced systemic inflammatory response, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial damage in the cerebrovascular system. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. CONCLUSION: The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis.

The objective of this study was to develop a novel method to rapidly clone the full-length cDNA of a very virulent NDV by only one assembly step. A completely synthetic 15 kb cDNA of a Malaysian genotype VIII NDV known as strain AF2240-I with additional flanking BsmBI sites was synthesised. However, to completely follow the rule-of-six, the additional G residues that are traditionally added after the T7 promoter transcription initiation site were not synthesised. The synthetic fragment was then cloned into low-copy number transcription vector pOLTV5-phiX between the T7 promoter and HDV Rz sequences through digestion with BbsI. The construct was co-transfected with helper plasmids into BSRT7/5 cells. A recombinant NDV called rAF was successfully rescued using transfection supernatant harvested as early as 16 h post-transfection. Virus from each passage showed an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and a mean death time (MDT) similar to the parent strain AF2240-I.

STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was carried out using 375 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89).

Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks.

Both hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is harmful to the host. The inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. All pathogens with sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis, after they succeed to adhere and pass the mucosal barrier of the host. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Through several signaling pathways, overstimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. Hyperinflammation is characterized by activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. The release of endogenous molecules by injured cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, leads to deterioration in a vicious cycle by further stimulation of PRRs. Features of immune suppression are massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes.","output":"Pathogenesis of Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by hyperactive neutrophils is recognized to play an important role in the thromboinflammatory milieu inherent to severe presentations of COVID-19.

We measured anti-NET antibodies in 328 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls.

Both antiCNET IgG and antiCNET IgM tracked with high levels of circulating NETs, impaired oxygenation efficiency, and high circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had a greater burden of anti-NET antibodies than did those not requiring oxygen supplementation. Levels of antiCNET IgG (and, to a lesser extent, antiCNET IgM) demonstrated an inverse correlation with the efficiency of NET degradation by COVID-19 sera. Furthermore, purified IgG from COVID-19 sera with high levels of anti-NET antibodies impaired the ability of healthy control serum to degrade NETs.

In this study, an integrative, participatory research approach was used to elucidate the sanitation and disease prevention practices in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in rural northern Thailand. METHODS: Initial steps included the identification of key stakeholders associated with the meat production chain, development of a research framework, and design of a methodology based on stakeholder consultations. The framework and methodology combine issues in five major areas: (1) public health, (2) socioeconomics, (3) policy, (4) veterinary medicine, and (5) communities and the environment. Methods used include questionnaires, direct observation, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. In addition, a microbiological risk assessment approach was employed to detect Salmonella contamination in meat processing facilities. The microbial risk assessment was combined with stakeholder perceptions to provide an overview of the existing situation, as well as to identify opportunities for upgrading slaughterhouses in order to more effectively address matters of food safety, processing, and government licensing. RESULTS: The conceptual framework developed elucidated the complex factors limiting small-scale slaughterhouse improvement including a lack of appropriate enabling policies and an apparent absence of feasible interventions for improvement. Unhygienic slaughterhouse management was reflected in the incidence of Salmonella contamination in both the meat and the surrounding environment. CONCLUSION: There is potential for the use of an integrative approach to address critical problems at the interface of rural development and public health. The findings of this study could serve as a model for transdisciplinary studies and interventions related to other similar complex challenges.

We evaluated risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized older adults with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of patients admitted to two geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 1st to June 15th, 2020. The difference in incidence, risk factors and adverse outcomes for AKI between patients with or without COVID-19 were examined. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of AKI and in-hospital death were obtained from logistic regression. RESULTS: Three hundred-sixteen older patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 876 patients for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. AKI occurred in 92 (29%) patients with COVID-19 vs. 159 (18%) without COVID-19. The odds for developing AKI were higher in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.76), low baseline kidney function as depicted by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [4.19 (2.48-7.05), for eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min, and 20.3 (9.95-41.3) for eGFR < 30 mL/min], and higher C reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.81 (1.11-2.95) in patients with initial CRP > 10 mg/L).

We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening.

Despite the popularity of robotic surgery across the United States, a national consensus for standardized training and education of robotic surgeons or surgical teams remains absent. In this quality improvement initiative, a novel, stepwise iterative Robotic Assistant Surgical Training (RAST) curriculum was developed to broaden and standardize robotic bedside assistant training. Thirteen voluntary participants, capable of fulfilling the bedside assistant role, were evaluated to determine if RAST enhanced the learners self-perceived level of confidence and comfort in their role as bedside assistant. A pre- and post-RAST training survey and a between-stages repeated-measures survey were conducted. All learner participants reported statistically significant increases in confidence and comfort after RAST training, (p = < 0.001), and between each stage, F (2, 24 = 60.47, p < .001; [Formula: see text] = 0.834). Participant feedback regarding curriculum improvement was obtained, suggesting the desire for more training and practice, in smaller groups of 2C3 participants. One hundred percent of participants felt RAST was beneficial and that it should be implemented as standardized training during onboarding for all robotic bedside assistants. Thus, a standardized, stepwise iterative robotic bedside assistant curriculum increases learner preparedness, comfort, and confidence, safely away from the patient bedside.

An accurate prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms. Methods A total of 1,040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from Sao Paulo, Brazil, were followed from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. Routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data was used to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). A random sample of 70% of patients was used to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other. Results All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale.

Here an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying LRG in human serum is described in which cytochrome c is employed as the capturing ligand and a monoclonal antibody specific for LRG is used to detect the captured glycoprotein. Application of this assay in quantifying LRG in various patients' sera is demonstrated. The concentration of LRG in sera of control subjects as determined by this assay is approximately 50 g/ml.

Here, we offer a new palpation sign for the diagnosis of AA. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the sign for the diagnosis of atypical forms of AA (i.e., in children and women of childbearing age). Methods: We have retrospectively analysed 2245 patients - children (aged 0C12), men (aged 12C18) and women of childbearing age (aged 12C45) with suspected AA, 401 of whom underwent surgery. Patients were divided into one of three age categories and, based on clinical data and histological findings, were defined as either false negative, false positive, or positive. Confirmed positive AA was defined based on histological findings, and confirmed negative AA was defined by histological findings as well as on clinical follow-up. Pearsons correlation analysis was used for the assessment of the correlation between the patients gender, age as well as their clinical and histological findings. Results: Based on these statistical results, we came to the following results. In children (aged 0C12, male/female) and in women of childbearing age (aged 12C45), we observed 14 (3,46%) false negative clinical findings for the palpation sign. In children and women of childbearing age, we observed a higher percentage of palpation sign positivity compared to false positivity. The new palpation sign minimizes unindicated revisions of the abdominal cavity, serves as a reliable indicator for surgery and is suitable for the diagnosis of AA in atypical forms (i.e., in children and women of childbearing age) with a sensitivity of 95,57%, a specificity of 95,78%, a positive predictive value of 67,86%, a negative predictive value of 99,50%, a positive likelihood ratio of 24,28, a negative likelihood ratio of 0,05 and an accuracy of 95,9%. The negative appendectomy rate in women of childbearing age was 9.22% and in children 6,72%. Conclusion: We conclude that the new palpation sign is effective (r > 0.95) for the diagnosis of atypical forms of AA (i.e., in children and women of childbearing age). It is aimed principally at the medical practitioners in different parts of the world and in a state of emergency (Covid-19 pandemic, wars, etc.) where the diagnostic facilities and technological resources are limited.","output":"A New Palpation Sign for the Diagnosis of Atypical Forms of Acute Appendicitis (Children and Women of Childbearing Age)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged pandemic leading to a state of international alert and leaving millions of infections and thousands of deaths all over the world. Analysis of statistics and epidemiological data for the pandemic outcome pinpointed a puzzling influence of human sex on the heterogeneous outcome of COVID-19, where hospital admissions and mortality were higher among males than females. Two theories explained the observed male-biased COVID-19 mortality based on either dosage of immunoregulatory genes coded in X- chromosomes, or on the abundance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme two (ACE2) receptors in males than females.Objective: In our study, we propose a third scenario through virtual screening of direct antiviral effects of sex hormones.Materials and Methods: Updated screening statistics from 47 countries displaying sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 were employed and visualized in the form of heatmaps depicting sex difference effects on statistics of cases and deaths. Molecular docking and binding simulations of investigated sex steroids against COVID-19 specific proteins were investigated.Results: Analysis of COVID-19 sex-disaggregated data confirmed that male-biased mortality and computer-aided docking found unexpected female sex hormones biased binding against key targets implicated in the life cycle of COVID-19 compared to the male sex hormone testosterone. Other investigated steroids showed promising docking scores, while the male sex hormone exhibited the lowest affinity.Conclusion: Female sex hormones virtually exhibit direct anti-COVID-19 effect, the proposed antiviral effect of sex hormones should be considered to explain the outcomes of mortality. Moreover, the fluctuation of sex hormones influences sex and personal derived-differential response to COVID-19 infection. ? 2021, Bentham Science Publishers.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. RESULTS: 15 International publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients' COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation management and outcomes of acute appendicitis (AA) in different centers in the Middle East. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study compared the presentation and outcomes of patients with AA who presented during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to patients who presented before the onset of the pandemic. Demographic data, clinical presentation, management strategy, and outcomes were prospectively collected and compared. RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy-one patients presented with AA during the COVID pandemic versus 1174 in the pre-COVID period. Delayed and complex presentation of AA was significantly more observed during the pandemic period. Seventy-six percent of patients underwent CT scanning to confirm the diagnosis of AA during the pandemic period, compared to 62.7% in the pre-COVID period. Non-operative management (NOM) was more frequently employed in the pandemic period. Postoperative complications were higher amid the pandemic as compared to before its onset. Reoperation and readmission rates were significantly higher in the COVID period, whereas the negative appendicectomy rate was significantly lower in the pandemic period (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a remarkable decrease in the number of patients with AA was seen along with a higher incidence of complex AA, greater use of CT scanning, and more application of NOM.

Clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and liver parameters and clinical events recorded during follow-up. Transient elastography [with Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) measurements] was performed at admission in 98 patients. All patients were followed up until day 28 or death. The two main outcomes of the study were 28-day mortality and the occurrence of the composite endpoint intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were elevated at admission in 130 patients (35%) and 167 (45%) patients, respectively. Overall, 14.6% of patients presented the composite endpoint ICU and/or death. Neither ALT elevations, prior liver disease, liver stiffness nor liver steatosis (assessed with CAP) had any effect on outcomes. However, patients with abnormal baseline AST had a higher occurrence of the composite ICU/death (21% versus 9.5%, p = 0.002).

In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men.

These dressings consist of a skin interface layer that absorbs fluid from the skin surface and reduces the potential for microbial colonization within the dressing by means of ionic silver. This study examines the ability of silver to reduce the bioburden within the dressing as well as the localized effect due to potential silver mobility. Approach: Ability of silver to reduce bioburden within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was assessed using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. Furthermore, silver mobility was assessed using an in vitro skin model to study the zone of inhibition along with released silver quantification. Using a porcine model, diffusion of silver into blood and tissue was studied using emission spectrometry and histology. Results: Microbial growth in the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was significantly reduced (2.7-4.9 log reduction) compared to a silver-free negative control. No zone of inhibition was observed for microbial colonies for up to 7 days with minimal localized silver release (<5.5 ppm release). In vivo studies demonstrated no measurable concentration (<0.2 g/g) of silver in the blood, urine, feces, kidney, and liver tissue biopsy. Innovation: This study provides an important insight into silver concentration and mobility within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing, given emerging concerns associated with potential silver cytotoxicity. Conclusion: These results indicate the concentration of silver (0.019% silver by weight) in the ROCF-ciNPT dressings has been adequate to reduce bioburden within the skin interface layer, while severely limiting the amount of silver leaching out.","output":"Assessment of Silver Levels in a Closed-Incision Negative Pressure Therapy Dressing: In Vitro and In Vivo Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This is mainly because the restrictive condition of intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy number (IHFN) is relaxed by the membership functions of Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy number (PyPHFN), so the range of domain value of PyPHFN is greatly expanded.

METHODOLOGY: In the academic year 2020, the first module examinations of the 2nd-year MBBS anatomy course was conducted on-campus via multiple-choice questions, short answer questions, and viva-voce. Owing to the COVID-19 lockdown, the following two module examinations were held online. The effectiveness of different assessment tools in the three module examinations was compared by calculating the discrimination indices and the area under the curve (AUC), using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: SAQs showed the highest discrimination index (0.38) compared to MCQs and viva-voce in the on-campus module examinations but dropped to the lowest in the subsequent online modules (0.24 and 0.18). In contrast, the discriminating power of the viva-voce increased from marginally (0.23) to very good (0.47 and 0.49) as the mode of assessment shifted to online examinations.

The incidence and prevalence in the general population is unknown. However, most cases occur in adults aged 40 years and older. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old woman presented to our primary care clinic for a hypertension and diabetes followup visit. The doctor, who had never seen the patient before, noticed several small lumps over the patients eyebrows. After she removed her headscarf and face mask for a thorough examination, numerous skin-colored papules and nodules were seen on her nose, nasal bridge, forehead, and around her eyebrows. She was referred to a dermatologist, and a skin biopsy showed well-circumscribed dermal nests of basaloid cells, with peripheral palisading, and keratin horn cysts surrounded by dense fibrous stroma. These features were consistent with trichoblastoma. She was then referred to a plastic surgeon to discuss further management options. The patient finally chose laser ablation as she was fearful of the other more invasive surgical options. CONCLUSIONS: This is a very rare case of extensive facial trichoblastoma. It highlights the need for clinicians to ensure optimal exposure when examining patients. It also highlights the role of biopsies for skin lesions of uncertain etiology. In this case, it helped to rule out basal cell carcinoma, which can be a more locally destructive condition than trichoblastoma.

This paper uses data from the American Time Use Survey to explore the relationship between daily work locations and travel in the United States from 2003 to 2017. Outcome variables include travel duration and travel during peak periods. Home is by far the most common non-office work location, but working from other peoples homes, cafs/libraries, vehicles, and combinations of multiple locations are also measured. Findings show that working from home only on a day (full-day telework) decreases daily travel duration and increases the likelihood of avoiding peak hour travel for both work and non-work related travel. However, for homeworkers who also conduct work from their workplace on the same day (part-day telework), there is no reduction in daily travel time, and avoiding peak hour travel is limited to work-related travel. Working from other locations such as cafs/libraries or vehicles increases the likelihood of not traveling at peak hours. Findings also indicate that morning peak periods are more affected by work location decisions than evening peak periods. A survival analysis of daily departure times for both full-day and part-day homeworkers provides insight into this mechanism. We conclude on the basis of these findings that demand management policies and peak avoidance incentives would be more effective if they encourage both temporal and spatial flexibility for employees when partnering with regional employers.","output":"Working at home and elsewhere: daily work location, telework, and travel among United States knowledge workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has been known to damage multiple organs; however, little is known about its impact on the reproductive system.

Materials Histological, biochemical, molecular, and functional aspects were evaluated in 1) Culture of mouse BV-2 glial cells subjected to oxidative-inflammatory damage by lipopolysaccharides (100 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of 40 M indole-3-carbinol (n = 5); 2) Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats receiving indole-3-carbinol (2000 ppm/day, orally) during the first 8 weeks of life (n = 15); 3) Isolated rat hearts were submitted to 10 min regional ischemia and 10 min reperfusion. Results 1) lipopolysaccharides induced oxidative stress and increased inflammatory markers; indole-3-carbinol reversed both conditions (interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor , the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, heat shock protein 70, all p < 0.01 vs lipopolysaccharides). 2) SHR rats showed histological, structural, and functional changes with increasing systolic blood pressure (154  8 mmHg vs. 122  7 mmHg in Wistar Kyoto rats, p < 0.01); Inflammatory-oxidative markers also increased, and nitric oxide and heat shock protein 70 decreased. Conversely, indole-3-carbinol reduced oxidative-inflammatory markers and systolic blood pressure (133  8 mmHg, p < 0.01 vs. SHR). 3) indole-3-carbinol reduced reperfusion arrhythmias from 8/10 in SHR to 0/10 (p = 0.0007 by Fisher's exact test). Conclusions Indole-3-carbinol reduces the inflammatory-oxidative-proarrhythmic process of hypertension. The nitric oxide and heat shock protein 70 are relevant mechanisms of indole-3-carbinol protective actions. Further studies with this pleiotropic phytochemical as a promising cardioprotective are guaranteed.","output":"Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and antiarrhythmic effect of indole-3-carbinol, a phytochemical derived from cruciferous vegetables."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The poultry industry faces challenge amidst global food security crisis.

The very high mortality rate in Central Sulawesi (3.36%) poses a challenge for health workers;therefore, they should be well informed and with up- to-date information about correct therapeutic decisions. One of the most common comorbidities that often occurs with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is hypertension. This study aims to determine the clinical characteristics and severity profile and their relationship with the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension in Palu, Central Sulawesi. A total of 185 data on COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment at the Palu City Hospital during 2021 and meeting the criteria were recruited as research samples. Patients were divided into hypertensive (43%) and non-hypertensive (57%). The results showed that the age group, comorbid diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels showed a significant relationship between the two groups (p < 0.05). The median length of stay was 12 days, with conditions leading to discharge (83%) and death (17%);patients who died were hospitalized in moderate and severe clinical conditions.

Ineffective clearance of Bpm by antibiotics is believed to be due to persistence, a hibernation-like survival mechanism modulated, in part, by toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS). Several organisms possess a repertoire of TASs but defining environmental cues eliciting their activity is hindered by laborious in vitro experiments, especially when there are many toxins with redundant function. Here, we identified which of 103 proteins in Bpm that share features found in toxins of the TAS and repurposed transcriptional data to identify which ones play a role in surviving intracellular host defenses. Putative toxins with the strongest transcriptional response were found to have low conservation between Bpm strains, while toxins that were constitutively expressed were highly conserved. Further examination of highly conserved toxins BPSS0899, BPSS1321, and BPSL1494 showed that they were functional, and their mutation led to reduce survival within macrophages and reduced in vivo persistence-associated pathology (abscesses) during treatment, but did not affect macrophages persistence. These findings highlight the utility of a data-driven approach to select putative toxins and suggests a selective role for some TAS in host survival.","output":"Predicting toxins found in toxin-antitoxin systems with a role in host-induced Burkholderia pseudomallei persistence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, approximately 11 million people are currently being held in prison, a number that has steadily grown since the turn of the 21st century.

The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)].

It provides a structured discussion around the need for curricula and framework which individual training programs in neuroanesthesiology can use to meet defined educational standards thus meeting criteria for accreditation. RECENT FINDINGS: Neuroanesthesiology training has traditionally been heterogenous around the world but international efforts from the community of neuroanesthesiology have culminated in the development of an international council for perioperative training in neuroscience in anesthesiology(ICPNT). This serves not only as an accrediting body but also creates a platform through their neuroanesthesia program relations committee for collaboration and engagement between various training programs internationally, increasing the educational standards of the individual programs and collectively increasing the overall level of standards for neuroanesthesia training. Standardized curriculum and competency-based assessments and milestones would help with narrowing the focus to quality education in neuroanesthesiology. SUMMARY: Structured training around the three pillars of neuroanesthesiology with concomitant accreditation is expected to lead to higher education standards with better patient care. The SNACC created milestones for neuroanesthesiology training during residency and the ICPNT can now use this as a foundation for fellowship training. Having a council to accredit and standardize will likely become indispensable in creating a set path for training in neuroanesthesiology. Additionally, the flexibility built in due to the international nature would allow modified and variable pathways depending upon individual capabilities and interests. The path forward will include widespread adoption of standardization supporting the overarching goal of excellent patient outcomes around the world.","output":"Standardization of Neuroanesthesia Education: Need of the Hour and the Way Forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many proactive steps have been taken worldwide to fight against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to prevent COVID-19 spread with realistic approaches.

Methods: A total of 230 cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 134 negative controls were recruited for a case-control analysis. Symptoms were analysed using the Acute Respiratory Tract Infections Questionnaire, while other symptoms were investigated by ad hoc questions. Results: Among the study samples (n = 364), 149 were males and 215 were females with age ranging from 20 to 89 years (mean 52.3). Four main groups of symptoms were obtained: influenza-like symptoms, ENT-symptoms, breathing issues and asthenia-related symptoms, representing 72%, 69%, 64% and 53% of overall referred clinical manifestations, respectively. ENT symptoms, breathing issues and influenza-like symptoms were associated with positivity to SARS-CoV-2, whereas asthenia-related symptoms did not show a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for other symptoms, comorbidities and demographic characteristics.

Nevertheless, perhaps the most crucial criticism comes from learners' difficulty in interpreting and making meaningful use of summative scores and the potentially detrimental impact these scores have on learners. The term \\"post-psychometric era\\" has become popular, despite persisting calls for the sensible use of modern psychometrics. In recent years, cognitive diagnostic modelling has emerged as a new psychometric paradigm capable of providing meaningful diagnostic feedback. Cognitive diagnostic modelling allows the classification of examinees in multiple cognitive attributes. This measurement is obtained by modelling these attributes as categorical, discrete latent variables. Furthermore, items can reflect more than one latent variable simultaneously. The interactions between latent variables can be modelled with flexibility, allowing a unique perspective on complex cognitive processes. These characteristic features of cognitive diagnostic modelling enable diagnostic classification over a large number of constructs of interest, preventing the necessity of providing numerical scores as feedback to test takers. This paper provides an overview of cognitive diagnostic modelling, including an introduction to its foundations and illustrating potential applications, to help teachers be involved in developing and evaluating assessment tools used in healthcare professions education. Cognitive diagnosis may represent a revolutionary new psychometric paradigm, overcoming the known limitations found in frequently used psychometric approaches, offering the possibility of robust qualitative feedback and better alignment with competency-based curricula and modern programmatic assessment frameworks.","output":"Cognitive diagnostic modelling in healthcare professions education: an eye-opener"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim: This study was targeted to see the correlation between D-Dimer level and severity of lung injury evaluated by CT scan to prevent major complications in early of disease.

To meet the demand in our institution, our surge plan included rapid mobilization of a novel continuous renal replacement treatment (CRRT) machine named SAMI. The SAMI is a push-pull filtration enhanced dialysis machine that can conjugate extremely high single-pass solute removal efficiency with very precise fluid balance control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Machine assembly was conducted on-site by local biomedical engineers with remote assistance by the vendor. One 3-h virtual training session of 3 dialysis nurses was conducted before SAMI deployment. The SAMI was deployed in prolonged intermittent replacement therapy (PIRRT) mode to maximize patients covered per machine per day. Live on-demand vendor support was provided to troubleshoot any issues for the first few cases. After 4 weeks of the SAMI implementation, data on treatments with the SAMI were collected, and a questionnaire was provided to the nurse trainees to assess device usability. RESULTS: On-site installation of the SAMI was accomplished with remote assistance. Delivery of remote training was successfully achieved. 23 PIRRT treatments were conducted in 10 patients. 7/10 of patients had CO-VID-19. The median PIRRT dose was 50 mL/kg/h (IQR [interquartile range] 44 - 62 mL/kg/h), and duration of the treatment was 8 h (IQR 6.3 - 8 h). Solute control was adequate. The user response was favorable to the set of usability questions involving user interface, on-screen instructions, machine setup, troubleshooting, and the ease of moving the machine. CONCLUSION: Assembly of the SAMI and training of nurses remotely are possible when access to vendor employees is restricted during states of emergency. The successful deployment of the SAMI in our institution during the pandemic with only 3-h virtual training supports that operating the SAMI is simple and safe.","output":"Deployment of a New CRRT/PIRRT Device during the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency: Organizational Challenges and Implementation Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives of the study: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the media has often mentioned the presence of quinine in tonic water. Media accounts of quinine's antiviral effect in vitro, as well as press reports about quinine-based compounds, such as hydroxychloroquine, have sparked renewed public interest in drinking tonic water, which could perhaps result in an increase in allergic phenomena. On the 200th anniversary of the discovery of quinine, our main objective was to analyze hypersensitivity reactions, related to the consumption of beverages containing quinine, described in the literature. Patients and methods: We analyzed case reports indexed on Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A quinine causality score was calculated for each of the observations. A quinine assay was performed on several beverages for which the quinine content had not been published. Results: In parallel with related pharmacokinetic studies, these case reports consist of 26 observations. The case reports mainly related to young men, with symptoms of varying severity, mainly dermatological, with fixed drug eruption, generalized rashes, hives; hematological, with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy; more rarely ocular, cardiac or auditory. The level of causality of quinine is certain for three cases, probable for twenty-two, possible for two. The levels of quinine, all conforming to the standards, were lower in the spirits and the cooked wine than those of tonic water.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid, efficient trials to rigorously evaluate new therapies for hospitalized patients with acute lung injury. Oxygen-free days (OFDs) is a novel outcome for clinical trials that is a composite of mortality and duration of new supplemental oxygen use. It is designed to characterize recovery from acute lung injury in populations with a high prevalence of new hypoxemia and supplemental oxygen use. In these populations, OFDs captures two patient-centered consequences of acute lung injury, including mortality and hypoxemic lung dysfunction. Power to detect differences in OFDs is typically greater than that for other clinical trial outcomes such as mortality and ventilator-free days. OFDs is the primary outcome for the ACTIV-4 Host Tissue platform, which evaluates novel therapies targeting the host response to COVID-19 among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and new hypoxemia.

Yet, few interventions exist for older PLWH that address psychological and physical symptoms combined, both prevalent in this population. There is a need to find innovative and accessible interventions that can help older PLWH to manage their symptoms. Mind-body interventions, like tai chi/qigong (TCQ), improve both physical and psychological health. TCQ is a series of slow, low-impact meditative movements that integrates breathwork, meditation, and stances. METHODS: The present study is an exploratory clinical trial that will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a 12-week, small group TCQ intervention (n = 24), a sham qigong control condition (n = 24), and a standard of care control condition (n = 24) for older people living with HIV/AIDS. It will also explore any preliminary associations between the TCQ intervention and symptom alleviation. Participants will be recruited from community-based health and social services organizations in Miami, FL, and randomized to one of the 3 conditions. DISCUSSION: We will assess feasibility and acceptability through questionnaires and adherence to TCQ. We will assess preliminary associations with symptoms such as depression, anxiety, social support, chronic HIV-related fatigue, and clinical outcomes. These will be described through proportions, means, and changes over time through graphing techniques. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up. These preliminary analyses also will provide information necessary to estimate effect size and power needed for a larger clinical trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03840525.

This multinational study of LATAM youth examined the distinguishing features of acute or late multisystem SARS COV2 with versus without cardiac involvement. A consecutive sample of youth 0-18 years old (N = 98;50% male) presenting with multisystem SARS COV2 to 32 centers in 10 Latin American countries participating in a pediatric cardiac multi-imaging society were grouped as with versus without cardiac involvement, defined as abnormal echocardiographic findings or arrhythmia. Collected clinical data were analyzed by Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test. Cardiac (N = 48, 50% male) versus no cardiac (N = 50, 50% male) were similar in age; weight; nonrespiratory symptoms; and medical history. The cardiac group had 1 death and symptoms including coronary artery dilation, ejection fraction <50%, pericardial effusion, peripheral edema, arrhythmia, and pulmonary artery thrombus. The cardiac group had higher risk of ICU admission (77% vs 54%, p = 0.02); invasive ventilation (23% vs 4%,p = 0.007); vasoactive infusions (27% vs 4%, p = 0.002); prominent respiratory symptoms (60% vs 36%, p < 0.03); abnormal chest imaging (69% vs 34%, p = 0.001); troponin (33% vs 12%, p = 0.01); alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 12%, p = 0.02); and thrombocytopenia (46% vs 22%, p = 0.02). Receiver operating curve analysis showed that abnormal laboratories had 94% sensitivity and 98% negative predictive value on the need for ICU interventions.Conclusion: In LATAM children with multisystem SARS COV2, cardiac involvement was prevalent. Cardiac involvement was more likely to require ICU interventions, certain abnormal labs, and respiratory involvement. What is Known: a? SARS COV2 can be asymptomatic in children but in some cases can have serious multisystemic involvement. a? Hispanic ethnicity is purportedly at high risk of SARS COV2 in nations where they are often disadvantaged minority populations. What is New: a? Latin American children presenting with multisystem SARS COV2 frequently have cardiac involvement which was associated with ICU interventions; prominent respiratory symptoms; abnormal chest X-ray; elevated troponin, ALT, and thrombocytopenia. a?

Here, we characterize change in neuro-ophthalmic care delivery during the early COVID-19 PHE, including a comparison of care delivered via telemedicine and in office. METHODS: Neuro-ophthalmology outpatient encounters from 3 practices in the United States (4 providers) were studied during the early COVID-19 PHE (March 15, 2020-June 15, 2020) and during the same dates 1 year prior. For unique patient visits, patient demographics, visit types, visit format, and diagnosis were compared between years and between synchronous telehealth and in-office formats for 2020. RESULTS: There were 1,276 encounters for 1,167 patients. There were 30% fewer unique patient visits in 2020 vs 2019 (477 vs 670) and 55% fewer in-office visits (299 vs 670).

Treatment with lithium can give rise to various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including thyroid dysfunction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypercalcaemia. Lithium may induce hypercalcaemia through both acute and chronic effects. The initial acute effects are potentially reversible and occur as a result of lithium's action on the calcium-sensing receptor pathway and glycogen synthase kinase 3, giving rise to a biochemical picture similar to that seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. In the long term, chronic lithium therapy leads to permanent changes within the parathyroid glands by either unmasking hyperparathyroidism in patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular hyperparathyroidism. The latter biochemical picture is identical to that of primary hyperparathyroidism. Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients on chronic lithium therapy, is associated with increased morbidity. Hence, regular monitoring of calcium levels in patients on lithium therapy is of paramount importance as early recognition of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism can improve outcomes.

Vaccine hesitancy and vaccine rates vary widely across countries and populations and are influenced by complex socio-cultural, political, economic, and psychological factors. Community engagement is an integral strategy within immunisation campaigns and has been shown to improve vaccine acceptance. As evidence on community engagement to support COVID-19 vaccine uptake is emerging, this review aims to lessen the knowledge-to-practice gap by providing regular evidence on current best-practice. Methodology A living systematic review will be conducted which includes an initial systematic review and bi-monthly review updates. Searching and screening for the review and subsequent updates will be done in four streams: a systematic search of six databases, grey literature review, preprint review, and citizen sourcing. All returned articles will be collated into Covidence, where screening will be done by a minimum of two reviewers at title/abstract and full-text. Data will be extracted across pre-defined data extraction tables, and synthesis will occur using the convergent integrated approach. Updates to the review resulting from the subsequent bi-monthly searches will be shared in an open-access platform. The protocol has been registered with PROSPERO: CRD42022301996. Discussion Given the variation in vaccination rates across different contexts and the recognition that high vaccination coverage is required to reduce COVID-19 transmission and to stop the emergence of new variants, it is imperative the global community implements strategies that will improve uptake and that this work is widely shared and contextualised. Community engagement to promote vaccine uptake is highly encouraged, and recent studies highlight its potential to influence vaccine rates, particularly across populations that are marginalised.

This this study aimed to investigate the influence of RAS blockers on the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing nationwide claims data of 215,184 adults who underwent SARS-CoV-2 tests in South Korea. The SARS-CoV-2 positive rates and clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the use of RAS blockers in patients with hypertension (n = 64,243). RESULTS: In total, 38,919 patients with hypertension were on RAS blockers. The SARS-CoV-2 positive rates were significantly higher in the RAS blocker group than in the control group after adjustments (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 1.36; p < 0.001), and matching by propensity score (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32; p = 0.017). Among the 1,609 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with hypertension, the use of RAS blockers was not associated with poor outcomes, such as mortality (adjusted OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.17; p = 0.265), and a composite of admission to the intensive care unit and mortality (adjusted OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.22; p = 0.669).

A single cell therapy laboratory was selected to function as the central cryopreservation hub for all European registry donor transplants intended for the Australian-Pacific region. We examined properties of these transplants to ascertain how quality is maintained. METHODS: We analyzed 100 pandemic-related allogeneic mobilized blood-derived stem cell apheresis products generated at 30 collection sites throughout Europe, shipped to and cryopreserved at our center between April and November of 2020. Products were shipped in the cool, subsequently frozen with DMSO as cryoprotectant. Irrespective of origin, all products were frozen within the prescribed shelf-life of 72 h. RESULTS: Prior to cryopreservation, viable stem cell and leukocyte count according to the collection site and our reference laboratory were highly concordant (r2 = 0.96 and 0.93, respectively) and viability was > 90% in all instances. Median nominal post-thaw recovery of viable CD34+ cells was 42%. Weakly associated with poorer CD34+ cell recovery was higher leukocyte concentration, but not time lag between apheresis or addition of cryopreservant, respectively, and start of freezing. The correlation between pre- and post-thaw CD34+ cell dose was high (r2 = 0.85), hence predictable. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were prompt with no evidence of dose dependency within the range of administered cell doses (1.31-15.56  106 CD34+ cells/kg). CONCLUSIONS: General cryopreservation of allogeneic stem cell transplants is feasible.

METHODS We investigated the association between peak systolic velocity of the mitral plane (s') and six-month neurological outcome in a population of 99 patients from a randomised controlled trial comparing TTM at 33  1 C for 24 h (h) (n = 47) vs. 48 h (n = 52) following OHCA (TTH48-trial). TTE was conducted at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after reaching target temperature. The primary outcome was 180 days neurological outcome assessed by Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC180) and the primary TTE outcome measure was s'. Secondary outcome measures were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), e', E/e' and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). RESULTS Across all three scan time points s' was not associated with neurological outcome (ORs: 24 h: 1.0 (95%CI: 0.7-1.4, p = 0.98), 48 h: 1.13 (95%CI: 0.9-1.4, p = 0.34), 72 h: 1.04 (95%CI: 0.8-1.4, p = 0.76)). LVEF, GLS, E/e', and TAPSE recorded on serial TTEs following OHCA were neither associated with nor did they predict CPC180. Estimated median e' at 48 h following TTM was 5.74 cm/s (95%CI: 5.27-6.22) in patients with good outcome (CPC180 1-2) vs. 4.95 cm/s (95%CI: 4.37-5.54) in patients with poor outcome (CPC180 3-5) (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS s' assessed on serial TTEs in comatose survivors of OHCA treated with TTM was not associated with CPC180.

Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model we report here the proinflammatory role of Spike (S) proteins from different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern after injection into the hindbrain ventricle, a cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid to which immune cells can be easily recruited and that mimics the alveolar environment of the human lung. We found that wild type/Wuhan variant S1 (S1WT) protein promoted neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, local and systemic hyperinflammation, emergency myelopoiesis, and hemorrhages. In addition, S1 protein was more proinflammatory and S1 was less proinflammatory than S1WT and, strikingly, S1 promoted delayed and long-lasting inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of the canonical inflammasome robustly alleviated S1 protein-induced inflammation and emergency myelopoiesis. In contrast, genetic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 strengthened the proinflammatory activity of S1, and the administration of angiopoietin (1-7) fully rescued S1-induced hyperinflammation and hemorrhages. These results shed light into the mechanisms orchestrating the COVID-19-associated CSS and the host immune response to different SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants. Highlights S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 promote hyperinflammation, neutrophilia, monocytosis and hemorrhages in zebrafish.

All HIV patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were included and compared with COVID-19 patients without HIV infection. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with HIV infection and confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were analyzed. The median age was 46 years (IQR: 37-56 years), and 88.9% were men. The median duration of HIV infection was 10.8 years (IQR: 6.5-16.8 years), and 96.8% were on antiretroviral therapy. 84.1% had previous comorbidities. The most common symptoms were fever (66.1%), cough (66.1%) and dyspnea (46.8%). Pneumonia was found in 47.5%, 28.6% of patients had severe disease, and 32.3% were admitted to hospital. The ICU admission rate and the mortality rate were both 3.17%. A significant association was observed between age, arterial hypertension, overweight, and diabetes mellitus and the severity of COVID-19. No association was observed between HIV-related factors and the severity of COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 in HIV-patients was 1.68%. Similar hospitalization (31.74% vs 32.57%) and ICU admission (3.17% vs 2%) rates were observed with non-HIV infected patients. A lower mortality rate during hospitalization (10% vs 21.37%) and a lower global mortality rate (3.17% vs 6.96%) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Established poor prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients, such as age and comorbidities, remain the main determinants for PLHIV. Neither the HIV severity nor the type of ARV treatment seem to influence the outcome of COVID-19. Large prospective cohorts are needed in order to establish the differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.","output":"COVID-19 in people living with HIV: A multicenter case-series study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Chronic inflammatory disorders of the placenta, in particular villitis of unknown etiology (VUE), chronic deciduitis (CD), chronic chorioamnionitis (CC), chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI), and eosinophilic/T-cell chorionic vasculitis (ETCV) can exclusively be diagnosed histologically. Using a standardized procedure for submission and pathological-anatomical examination of placentas in a single perinatal care center, we analyzed the association of chronic placental lesions to perinatal complications. METHODS We reviewed all singleton placentas and miscarriages that were examined histologically over a period of ten years after having implemented a standardized protocol for placental submission in our hospital. Cases with chronic inflammatory lesions were identified, and clinical data were analyzed and compared with a focus on preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, and fetal growth restriction and/or fetal demise. RESULTS In 174 placentas, at least one of the chronic inflammatory entities was diagnosed. CD was the most frequent disorder (n = 95), and had strong associations with preterm birth (47.3% of all cases with CD) and intrauterine fetal demise. VUE (n = 74) was exclusively diagnosed in the third trimester. This disorder was associated with a birth weight below the 10th percentile (45% of the cases) and hypertensive disease in pregnancy. Miscarriage and intrauterine fetal demise were associated with CHI (in 66.7% of cases, n = 18). CONCLUSIONS Chronic inflammatory disorders are frequently observed and contribute to major obstetric and perinatal complications. Further studies are needed to get a better picture of the connection between adverse obstetric outcomes and chronic inflammation to aid in the better counseling of patients.","output":"Hypertensive disease, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and chronic inflammatory disorders of the placenta: experiences in a single institution with a standardized protocol of investigation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Older?Rachel Zack Ishikawa and Jennifer Gatchel are joint co-authors adults are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 They are more likely than younger adults to be hospitalized with the illness and more likely to die from it, with 8 out of 10 deaths due to COVID-19 occurring among adults aged 65+ 1 Patients with psychiatric disorders have also been particularly impacted, with higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, anger, insomnia and suicidal ideation, compared with those without psychiatric disorders 2 Understanding specific pandemic-related concerns of older adults with psychiatric comorbidity is essential to providing appropriate treatment and to preventing illness onset or exacerbation in this vulnerable population Methods The study involved design and administration of a brief survey, the Older Adult Pandemic Inventory (OAPI), to patients aged 60 years and above in the outpatient psychiatry clinic of a large urban general hospital The OAPI was developed by geriatric psychiatry outpatient clinicians, and additional input was provided by the hospital's Quality Improvement (QI) committee The OAPI consisted of 6 question domains related to pandemic-related challenges and unmet needs around mental health, physical health, psychosocial and financial well-being, as well as positive changes (e g , growth, coping, self-efficacy) Clinicians administered the survey to patients on a rolling basis during telehealth visits in October and November 2020 and entered responses using the REDCap online survey data collection platform Results Survey data were collected from thirty patients between October and November 2020 67% of patients were female, and 96% identified as non-Hispanic white, with a mean age of 75 years (Range: 60-78y) Primary diagnostic classes included depressive (60%) and anxiety disorders (57%);co-morbidity/multiple diagnoses were permitted The majority of respondents endorsed at least one pandemic-related challenge in each category The most common mental health or emotional challenges were anxiety (93%), depression (77%), uncertainty about the trajectory of the pandemic (70%) and boredom (67%) The most common physical health challenge was difficulty maintaining physical activity (62%) Problems related to psychosocial well-being included discomfort seeing others who are unmasked (73%) and feeling unsafe in places of business (53%) 61% of participants denied financial challenges 69% identified access to friends and family as their primary unmet need 67% of participants reported that the pandemic has brought positive changes, including improved coping ability, increased comfort with technology, and spiritual growth Clinicians reported that the time required to administer the survey (10 minutes) was a major barrier to asking the questions, given limited visit encounter times Conclusions Older adult patients in a general outpatient psychiatric clinic reported pandemic-related challenges in mental and physical health and social well-being as well as unmet needs on the OAPI survey The most prominent themes centered on anxiety, uncertainty, challenges maintaining physical activity and social connection, and feeling uncomfortable with mitigation behaviors of others A majority of respondents also endorsed positive changes resulting from the pandemic Ongoing development and revision and broader administration of the OAPI to diverse populations will clarify the specific concerns and needs of older psychiatric patients during the pandemic Alternative approaches for administering the survey, including options for online patient self-administration, are currently being explored Funding Not applicable","output":"The Older Adult Pandemic Inventory: Preliminary Findings from an Outpatient Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing number of digital solutions developed for use in clinical health care settings is accompanied by new challenges to develop and conduct clinical studies that include eHealth technologies.

EVs with different protein contents are released into circulation in different diseases. Recent studies have identified proteins in adenomyosis (AM)-derived EVs (AMEVs) from blood as biomarkers for this disease. AM is an extension of endometrial tissue into the uterine myometrium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging tool for identifying adenomyosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of EVs in diagnosing AM. In the present study, tissue AMEVs (T-AMEVs) were isolated from lesion homogenates of patients with adenomyosis, and blood AMEVs (B-AMEVs) were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with AM via differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation. T-AMEVs and B-AMEVs were characterized by electron microscopy, western blotting and mass spectrometry and analysed using FunRich3.1.3 software. T-AMEVs (average diameter, 150.9102.2 nm) and B-AMEVs (194.166.81 nm) expressed the CD9, CD63 and flotillin-2 EV markers. A total of 211 proteins expressed in T-AMEVs and B-AMEVs overlapped with Vesiclepedia database entries, including 2 epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins and 6 invasion-associated proteins.

However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and their institutions should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","output":"COVID-19 Hangover: A Rising Tide of Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relato de caso Mulher, 47 anos, secretria, proveniente de uma cidade no oeste do Paran, veio encaminhada por meio do SAMU para o Hospital do Pblico do Oeste do Paran em Cascavel, devido a complica??es pela Covid-19.

The role of viral infections in the etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) was prospectively evaluated from 2008 to 2012 at a university-level intensive care unit. Methods. Clinical data and microbiological tests were assessed: blood cultures, urine pneumococcal and legionella antigens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies from paired serums, and respiratory virus detection by multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower tracheal specimens via intubation tube. Results. Of 49 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients (21 men and 28 women; median age, 54 years), the etiology was identified in 45 cases (92%). There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterialCviral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterialCviral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25thC75th percentiles, 294C416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25thC75th percentiles, 1.6C1.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterialCviral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02). Conclusions. Viral findings were demonstrated in almost half of the SCAP patients. Clinical characteristics were similar between the pure bacterial and mixed bacterialCviral infections groups.

PROCEDURE: A retrospective French study was conducted on infants with severe bronchiolitis ventilated by nCPAP in the PED at the Ambroise Par Hospital, from winter 2009 to winter 2011. RESULTS: Out of the 31 infants, 16% were formerly prematurely born with otherwise no significant medical history. Postnatal age was 2 months. The rate of nCPAP performed for apneas (single indication of nCPAP for severe bronchiolitis according to the 2006 French medical consensus) was 17%. At least two indications of nCPAP used in the PICU were found for every patient. Babies were transferred within 2 h of nCPAP to the PICU. Clinical improvement was already observed with significantly slower respiratory rate and normalization of capnia and pH (P < 0.001) and without any complication at the PED. NCPAP was pursued in the PICU in 84% of the cases. The average duration of nCPAP was of 2.7 days, with the duration of hospitalization in the PICU of 4.2 days.

However, little is known on the impact of anti-CD20 pre-exposition and the use of different sources of plasma (convalescent versus vaccinated) on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and viral evolution after plasma therapy. Methods: Eligible COVID-19 patients (n = 36), half of them after anti-CD20 targeted therapy, were treated with therapeutic plasma from convalescent (n = 17) or mRNA-vaccinated (n = 19) donors. Each plasma-transfused patient was thoroughly monitored over time by anti-S IgG quantification and whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Results: The majority of anti-CD20 pre-exposed patients (15/18) showed progressive declines of anti-S protein IgG titers following plasma therapy, indicating that they mostly relied on the passive transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Such antibody kinetics correlated with prolonged infection before virus clearance, contrasting with the endogenous humoral response predominantly present in patients who had not received B-cell depleting agents (15/18). No relevant differences were observed between patients treated with plasma from convalescent and/or vaccinated donors. Finally, 4/30 genotyped patients showed increased intra-host viral evolution and 3/30 included 1 to 4 spike mutations, potentially associated to immune escape.

However, placental transfer of particles is often highly limited, and evidence is growing that NMs can also indirectly interfere with fetal development. Here, we outline current knowledge on potential indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of NMs. SHORT CONCLUSION: Until now, research on developmental toxicity has mainly focused on the biodistribution and placental translocation of NMs to the fetus to delineate underlying processes. Systematic research addressing NM impact on maternal and placental tissues as potential contributors to mechanistic pathways in developmental toxicity is only slowly gathering momentum. So far, maternal and placental oxidative stress and inflammation, activation of placental toll-like receptors (TLRs), impairment of placental growth and secretion of placental hormones, and vascular factors have been suggested to mediate indirect developmental toxicity of NMs. Therefore, NM effects on maternal and placental tissue function ought to be comprehensively evaluated in addition to placental transfer in the design of future studies of developmental toxicity and risk assessment of NM exposure during pregnancy.","output":"Recent insights on indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of nanomaterials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation.

Furthermore, scientists have developed several vaccinations, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged governments and people to get vaccinated to eradicate this pandemic. Consequently, the findings of any scientific research into this phenomenon are highly interesting. Problem Statement. To enhance individual protection, it is now critical to analyze and compare the percentage of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19. It is constantly of interest in the field of big data science and other related disciplines to provide the best analysis and modeling of COVID-19 data. Methodology. Through this paper, we aimed to compare individuals who have been completely vaccinated against COVID-19 in two locations: North American countries and Arabian Peninsula countries. Simple techniques for comparing individuals who have been completely vaccinated against COVID-19 have been applied, which may be used to generate the foundation for conclusions. Most significantly, a modern statistical model was created to present the best assessment of individuals completely vaccinated against COVID-19 data in nations in North America and the Arabian Peninsula. Some of the suggested statistical model features were proposed. Furthermore, the estimate of the model parameters was driven using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Results. The flexibility provided by the proposed statistical model is useful for describing the percentage of the individuals completely vaccinated against COVID-19, which provides a close fit with the COVID-19 data. Implications. The proposed statistical model can be used for statistics and generate new statistical distributions that can be used to compare and predict the process of people's willingness to vaccinate and take the vaccine to try to eliminate COVID-19.","output":"Statistical Analysis of the People Fully Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Two Different Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3D\\\\printing technology provided numerous contributions to the health sector during the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

Abnormal liver chemistry tests of varying severities occur in a majority of patients. However, there is a dearth of accompanying liver histologic studies in these patients. Methods: The current report details the clinical courses of two patients having severe COVID-19 hepatitis. Liver biopsies were analyzed under light microscopy, portions of liver tissue were hybridized with a target probe to the SARS-CoV-2 S gene, and small sections from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver tissue were processed for electron microscopy. Results The liver histology of both cases showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with prominent bile duct damage, endotheliitis and many apoptotic bodies. In-situ hybridization and electron microscopy suggest the intrahepatic presence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the findings of which may indicate the possibility of direct cell injury. Conclusions Based on the abundant apoptosis and severe cholangiocyte injury, these histopathological changes suggest a direct cytopathic injury. Furthermore, some of the histopathological changes may resemble acute cellular rejection occurring after liver transplantation.

RECENT FINDINGS Studies of central nervous system (CNS) tissue in brain model systems and from adults with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have begun to uncover potential mechanisms for neurological damage during COVID-19. These studies suggest that direct viral invasion of the CNS occurs in a subset of cases but does not frequently cause overt viral meningoencephalitis. Vascular abnormalities including microvascular thrombi and endothelial activation, as well as parainfectious processes, including CNS specific immune responses, may contribute to neurological symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. SUMMARY Neuroimmune perturbations and vascular inflammation observed in people with COVID-19 may warrant investigation of immune-modulating interventions to ameliorate neurological complications associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We paired the rental listings with census tract information from the American Community Survey in order to investigate economic and racial/ethnic patterns in the spatial distribution of the properties. We find that less expensive pet-friendly listings were more likely to have pet fees charged on top of rent than rental units that were more expensive. Additionally, when pet fee burden was defined as a function of average income by census tract, low-income communities and communities of color were more likely than higher income and predominantly White communities to pay disproportionately higher fees to keep pets in their homes. We also find patterns of spatial inequalities related to pet fee burden by a metric of income inequality by city. The burden of pet rental fees may contribute to both housing insecurity and companion animal relinquishment.

Moreover, threshold guards can be found in recent blockchain algorithms such as Tendermint consensus. In this tutorial, we give an overview of the techniques implemented in Byzantine Model Checker (ByMC). ByMC implements several techniques for automatic verification of threshold-guarded distributed algorithms. These algorithms have the following features: (1) up to t of processes may crash or behave Byzantine; (2) the correct processes count messages and make progress when they receive sufficiently many messages, e.g., at least [Formula: see text]; (3) the number n of processes in the system is a parameter, as well as t; (4) and the parameters are restricted by a resilience condition, e.g., [Formula: see text]. Traditionally, these algorithms were implemented in distributed systems with up to ten participating processes. Nowadays, they are implemented in distributed systems that involve hundreds or thousands of processes. To make sure that these algorithms are still correct for that scale, it is imperative to verify them for all possible values of the parameters.","output":"Tutorial: Parameterized Verification with Byzantine Model Checker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its COVID-19 disease on mothers and their offspring are less known.

This review showed the influence of COVID-19 disease on the neonatal neurogenesis. Owing to no specific vaccines or medicines that were reported for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, this review suggested some control strategies like treatments (medicinal plants, antiviral therapy, cellular therapy, and immunotherapy), nutrition uptake, prevention, and recommendations. DISCUSSION This overview showed in severely states that SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early stage of pregnancy might increase the risk of stress, panic, and anxiety. This disorder can disturb the maternal immune system, and thus causing a neurodevelopmental disturbance. This hypothesis may be depending on the severity and intensity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dams to their fetuses is absent until now.

METHODS: We used multiple strategies to develop a patient-centered, tailored decision aid. We began by forming a Patient and Family Advisory Council to provide continuous input to our multidisciplinary team on the development of the tool. Additionally, focus groups consisting of nurses, therapists, social workers, physicians, stroke survivors, and family members reviewed key elements of the tool, including prognostic information, graphical displays, and values clarification exercise. To design the values clarification exercise, we asked focus groups to provide feedback on a list of important activities of daily living. An ordinal prognostic model was developed for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage using data taken from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive Plus, and incorporated into the tool. RESULTS: Focus group participants recommended making numeric prognostic information optional due to possible emotional distress. Pie charts were generally favored by participants for graphical presentation of prognostic information, though a horizontal stacked bar chart was also added due to its prevalence in stroke literature. Plain language descriptions of the modified Rankin Scale were created to accompany the prognostic information. A values clarification exercise was developed consisting of a list of 13 situations that may make an individual consider comfort measures only. The final version of the web based tool (which can be viewed on tablets) included the following sections: general introduction to stroke, outcomes (prognostic information and recovery), in-hospital and life-sustaining treatments, decision making and values clarification, post-hospital care, tips for talking to the health care team, and a summary report.

So far, simulation has only been carried out in a static way, thereby omitting dynamic effects of coughing or vomiting. We developed a dynamic model of the anterior abdominal wall. MATERIALS AND METHODS An aluminium cylinder was equipped with a pressure controlled, fluid-filled plastic bag, simulating the abdominal viscera. A computer-controlled system allowed the control of influx and efflux, thus creating pressure peaks of up to 200 mmHg to simulate coughing and 290 mmHg to simulate vomiting. We tested fixation with tacks (Absorbatack, Covidien Deutschland, Neustadt a. D., Germany). The model was controlled for the friction coefficient of the tissue against the mesh and the physiologic elasticity of the abdominal wall surrogate. RESULTS The model was able to create pressure peaks equivalent to physiologic coughs or vomiting. Physiologic elasticity was thereby maintained. We could show that the friction coefficient is crucial to achieve a physiologic situation. The meshes showed a tendency to dislocate with an increasing number of coughs (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, when applied in a plain manner, the meshes withstood more cough cycles than when applied with a bulge as in laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS The dynamic movement of the abdominal wall, the friction between tissue and mesh and the way of mesh application are crucial factors that have to be controlled for in simulation of ventral abdominal hernia closure. We could demonstrate that patient specific factors such as the frequency of coughing as well as the application technique influence the long term stability of the mesh.","output":"Development of a dynamic model for ventral hernia mesh repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The negative impacts of spousal bereavement on the emotional health of the elderly (e.g., depression and anxiety) have been revealed.

Multidisciplinary collaboration from the Detroit Health Department (DHD), academic centers, along with interim guidance from the CDC provided a structured approach to control SARS-CoV-2 in Detroit skilled nursing facilities (SNF). We aim to describe this model. METHODS: There were 26 SNF prioritized by the DHD over a 13-month period from 3/2020 - 4/2021. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 occurred biweekly, on average, at each facility for staff and residents. Any staff or resident cases were investigated by a specialized investigations team to determine outbreak status. Any resident that was identified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 was moved to a designated in-house quarantine unit or specific COVID-19 designated nursing homes within the City of Detroit, and cohorting guidance was provided. Facilities were evaluated for environmental controls, PPE provided as needed and infection prevention guidance was provided. COVID-19 vaccination was conducted by pharmaceutical chains or the DHD and vaccine education sessions were conducted for nursing home staff and residents. RESULTS: On average, SNF facilities served a total of 2,262 residents (2031-2367 range) and employed a total of 2,965 staff (1034-3124 range) during the period from 7/2020 - 4/2021.

Beginning 3/2020, the majority of cases were residents, whereas after 10/2020, staff cases exceeded resident cases. Immunization rates were 63% (partial) and 58% (complete) for residents, and 26% and 23% for staff, respectively. Measures to reduce vaccine hesitancy included organized education sessions, messaging from trusted leaders and organized mass vaccination schedules. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We describe the effectiveness of multidisciplinary interventions to control dissemination, morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 amongst SNF residents in Detroit. We emphasize the continued need to address vaccine hesitancy and importance of this model as successful interventions to decrease infection rates. DISCLOSURES: Paul E.

Therapeutics for such illnesses can be developed using traditional medicine. However, it is not an easy path from natural products to Western pharmacological and pharmaceutical methods. For several decades, chronic inflammatory disorders, especially in Westernized countries, have increased incidence and prevalence. Several NSAIDs are used to decrease inflammation and pain; however, there are numerous negative consequences of these anti-inflammatory medications, whereas plant-based natural products have anti-inflammatory therapeutic benefits that have little or no adverse effects. Nanoparticles are a new type of drug delivery device that may be designed to provide excellent target selectivity for certain cells and tissues while also having a high drug loading capacity, resulting in better pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PKPD), and therapeutic bioavailability. The size and polarity of phytochemical compounds make it hard to pass the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB), blood-vessel endothelial lining, gastrointestinal tract and mucosa. In addition, the gastrointestinal system is enzymatically destroyed. Therefore, nanoparticles or nanocrystals might also be used for encapsulation or conjugation of these chemicals as a method to improve their organic effectiveness through their gastrointestinal stability, absorption rate and dispersion. The therapy of numerous inflammatory illnesses, including arthritis, gastritis, Nephritis, Hepatitis (Type A, B &C), ulcerative colitis, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, allergic responses (asthma, eczema) or autoimmune disorders, is characterised by nanoparticles.

However, it is less well known if stroke lesions in different brain regions are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). We therefore investigated this association by multivariate lesion-symptom mapping. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the WAKE-UP trial. European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level questionnaires were completed 90 days after stroke. Lesion symptom mapping was performed using a multivariate machine learning algorithm (support vector regression) based on stroke lesions 22-36 h after stroke. Brain regions with significant associations were explored in reference to white matter tracts. Of 503 randomized patients, 329 were included in the analysis (mean age 65.4 years, SD 11.5; median NIHSS = 6, IQR 4-9; median EQ-5D score 90 days after stroke 1, IQR 0-4, median lesion volume 3.3 ml, IQR 1.1-16.9 ml). After controlling for lesion volume, significant associations between lesions and EQ-5D score were detected for the right putamen, and internal capsules of both hemispheres. Multivariate lesion inference analysis revealed an association between injuries of the cortico-spinal tracts with worse self-reported quality of life 90 days after stroke in comparably small stroke lesions, extending previous reports of the association of striato-capsular lesions with worse functional outcome.

Myoglobin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most severe complications of RM. Based on our previous research, exogenous biological renal support alleviates renal ischemiaCreperfusion injury in elderly mice. This study aimed to determine whether exogenous biological renal support promotes renal recovery from RM-induced AKI and to preliminarily explore the mechanisms involved. Methods: A parabiosis animal model was established to investigate the effects of exogenous biological renal support on RM-induced AKI. Mice were divided into three groups: the control group (in which mice were injected with sterile saline), the RM group (in which mice were injected with 8 mL/kg glycerol), and the parabiosis + RM group (in which recipient mice were injected with glycerol 3 weeks after parabiosis model establishment). Blood samples and kidney tissue were collected for further processing 48 h after RM induction. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted via Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and clustering analysis. Results: No mice died within 48 h after the procedure. Exogenous biological renal support attenuated the histological and functional deterioration in mice with RM-induced AKI. Bioinformatics analysis identified key pathways and proteins involved in this process. We further demonstrated that exogenous biological renal support ameliorated AKI through multiple mechanisms, including by suppressing the complement system; attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death; and increasing proliferation. Conclusions: Exogenous biological renal support provided by parabiosis can improve renal function in RM-induced AKI by suppressing the complement system; decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death; and promoting tubular cell proliferation. Our study provides basic research evidence for the use of bioartificial kidneys to treat RM-induced AKI.","output":"Exogenous Biological Renal Support Improves Kidney Function in Mice With Rhabdomyolysis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new coronavirus (named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) spread from China, causing a pandemic in a very short time. The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019) is pneumonia, but several cardiovascular complications may also occur (e.g., acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiogenic shock). Direct or indirect mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 could be implicated in the pathogenesis of these events.

EMH, states that in an efficient market current prices of securities reflect all publicly available information, and shares are traded at their fair values. Anomalies in information availability are not possible and no individual investor can get superior returns. Hence, prices/stocks move in random, supporting Random Walk Theory. Timing of investment also would not fetch better returns than market returns. Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH), contrary to EMH, argues that stock/index returns do not follow a random walk process, rather follow a trend, and predictions can be made concerning stocks /index returns. It also asserts that financial markets are neither efficient nor inefficient, but they shift between efficient and inefficient. Thus, markets are adaptive and will have frictions. Further, AMH will also assume that the risk-reward of investors changes over a while, historical prices influence current prices and constant arbitrage opportunities are created.COVID-19 like crisis provided an opportunity to generate excess returns as stocks trading below their fair value.

Here, additional roles/benefits of FS/FG in spine surgery are explored; these include increased hemostasis, reduction of scar, reduction of the risk of infection if impregnated with antibiotics, and its application to restrict diffusion and limit some of the major complications attributed to the controversial \\"off-label\\" use of bone morphogeneitc protein (rhBMP-2/INFUSE). METHODS We reviewed multiple studies, focusing not just on the utility of FS/FG in the treatment of CSF fistulas, but on its other applications. RESULTS FS/FG have been primarily used to supplement elective/traumatic dural closure in spinal surgery. However, FS/FG also contribute to; hemostasis, reducing intraoperative/postoperative bleeding/transfusion requirements, length of stay (LOS)/costs, reduced postoperative scar/radiculitis, and infection when impregnated with antibiotics. Nevertheless, one should seriously question whether FS/FG should be applied to prevent diffusion and limit major complications attributed to the \\"off-label\\" use of BMP/INFUSE (e.g., limit/prevent heterotopic ossification, dysphagia/respiratory decompensation, and new neurological deficits).

Mammogenesis refers to the growth and development of mammary gland, which begins at puberty and ends after lactation. Pregnancy is regulated by various cytokines, which further contributes to mammary gland development. Epithelial cells, including basal and luminal cells, are one of the major components of mammary gland cells. The development of basal and luminal cells has been observed to significantly differ at different stages. However, the underlying mechanisms for differences between basal and luminal cells have not been fully studied. To explore the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of mammary progenitors or their offspring into luminal and myoepithelial cells, the single-cell sequencing data on mammary epithelia cells of virgin and pregnant mouse was deeply investigated in this work. We evaluated features by using Monte Carlo feature selection and plotted the incremental feature selection curve with support vector machine or RIPPER to find the optimal gene features and rules that can divide epithelial cells into four clusters with different cell subtypes like basal and luminal cells and different phases like pregnancy and virginity. As representations, the feature genes Cldn7, Gjb6, Sparc, Cldn3, Cited1, Krt17, Spp1, Cldn4, Gjb2 and Cldn19 might play an important role in classifying the epithelial mammary cells.

Epidemiological models play a crucial role, thereby assisting policymakers to predict the future course of infections and hospitalizations. One difficulty with current models is the existence of exogenous and unmeasurable variables and their significant effect on the infection dynamics. In this paper, we show how a method from nonlinear control theory can complement common compartmental epidemiological models. As a result, one can estimate and predict these exogenous variables requiring the reported infection cases as the only data source. The method allows to investigate how the estimates of exogenous variables are influenced by non-pharmaceutical interventions and how imminent epidemic waves could already be predicted at an early stage. In this way, the concept can serve as an epidemometer and guide the optimal timing of interventions. Analyses of the COVID-19 epidemic in various countries demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed approach.

In mammals, mutations in polyQ segments (and CAG repeats at the nucleotide level) have been linked to neural disorders and ataxias. PolyQ regions in normal human proteins have documented functional roles, in transcription factors and, more recently, in regulating autophagy. Despite the high frequency of polyQ repeats in eukaryotic genomes, little attention has been given to the presence or possible role of polyQ sequences in virus genomes. A survey described here revealed that polyQ repeats occur rarely in RNA viruses, suggesting that they have detrimental effects on virus replication at the nucleotide or protein level. However, there have been sporadic reports of polyQ segments in potyviruses and in reptilian nidoviruses (among the largest RNA viruses known). Conserved polyQ segments are found in the regulatory control proteins of many DNA viruses. Variable length polyQ tracts are found in proteins that contribute to transmissibility (cowpox A-type inclusion protein (ATI)) and control of latency (herpes viruses). New longer-read sequencing methods, using original biological samples, should reveal more details on the presence and functional role of polyQ in viruses, as well as the nucleotide regions that encode them. Given the known toxic effects of polyQ repeats, the role of these segments in neurovirulent and tumorigenic viruses should be further explored.

The present case illustrates that C. rectus can be a cause of not only periodontal disease but also pulmonary infection.","output":"A Rare Case of Pleural Empyema Caused by Campylobacter rectus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the practice of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy units and may increase the risk of digestive disorders. We described the situational changes in GI endoscopy and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) proportion during COVID-19 in Vietnam and examined the associated factors. METHODS: A retrospective ecological study was conducted on data of Hanoi Medical University Hospital, Vietnam. The number of upper GI endoscopy and the proportion of GI emergency endoscopy and PUD were compared between 2019 and 2020 by month (January to June). Log-binomial regression was used to explore associated factors of GI emergency endoscopy and PUD. RESULTS: The number of endoscopies decreased remarkably during the nationwide social distancing in April 2020. Compared to April 2019, the proportion in April 2020 of both GI emergency endoscopy [4.1 vs. 9.8%, proportion ratio (PR) 2.39, 95% CI 2, 2.87], and PUD [13.9 vs. 15.8%; PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.29] was significantly higher. In log-binomial models, the proportion of GI emergency endoscopy was higher in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (adjusted PR, 2.41; 95% CI, 2.01, 2.88). Male sex and age of 50 years were associated with an increased PUD and GI emergency conditions. CONCLUSION: The proportion of both GI emergency endoscopy and PUD was significantly higher during the time of the state of emergency due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when compared to 2019 at the same health facility in Vietnam. The findings suggest that healthcare delivery reforms during the era of an emerging pandemic are required to reduce digestive disorders, in particular, and chronic diseases in general.","output":"Changes in the Proportion of Gastrointestinal Emergency Endoscopy and Peptic Ulcer Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Local Retrospective Observational Study From Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To experience an epidemic while lying on a sickbed opens up other ways of thinking through time, epidemics, and sequence from those developed by Charles Rosenberg in his 1989 essay, \\"What Is an Epidemic?\\".

Seasonality of gene expression in immune cells from blood could be a consequence of within-host seasonal immunity interacting with the seasonal pandemics of influenza (flu) in temperate regions and, thus, with potential valuable analogy transfer to the proposed seasonal development of covid-19. Here we operationalized within-host immunity as genes with both a significant seasonal term and a significant flu term in the sine-cosine model. Information on gene expression was based on microarray using RNase buffered blood samples collected randomly from a population-based cohort of Norwegian middle-aged women in 2003-2006, The Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. The unique discovery (N=425) and replication (N=432) design were based on identical sampling and preprocessing. Data on proportion of sick leaves due to flu, and the flu intensities per week was obtained from the National Institute of Public Health, giving a semi-ecological analysis. The discovery analysis found 2942 (48.1%) significant genes in a generalized seasonal model over four years. For 1051 within-host genes both the seasonal and the flu term were significant. These genes followed closely the flu intensities. The trajectories showed slightly more genes with a maximum in early winter than in late summer. Moving the flu intensity forward in time indicated a better fit 3-4 weeks before the observed influenza. In the replication analyses, 369 genes (35.1% of 1051) were significant. Exclusion of genes with unknown functions and with more than a season in difference reduced the number of genes in the discovery dataset to 305, illustrating the variability in the measurements and the problem in assessing weak biological relationships. Thus, we found for the first time a clear seasonality in gene expression with marked responses to the annual seasonal influenza in a unique discovery - replication design.

Lower prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children, in addition to higher numbers of mild and asymptomatic cases, continues to provide challenges in determining appropriate prevention and treatment courses. Here, we summarize the current evidence on the transmission, clinical presentation, complications and risk factors in regard to SARS-CoV-2 in children, and highlight crucial gaps in knowledge going forward. Based on current evidence, children are rarely the primary source of secondary transmission in the household or in child care and school settings and are more likely to contract the virus from an adult household member. Higher transmission rates are observed in older children (10-19 years old) compared with younger children ( <10 years old). While increasing incidence of COVID-19 in neonates raises the suspicion of vertical transmission, it is unlikely that breast milk is a vehicle for transmission from mother to infant. The vast majority of clinical cases of COVID-19 in children are mild, but there are rare cases that have developed complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which often presents with severe cardiac symptoms requiring intensive care. Childhood obesity is associated with a higher risk of infection and a more severe clinical presentation.

Transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) offers a non-invasive alternative to implanted VNS and may provide similar therapeutic benefit. There is much discussion about the optimal approach for combining VNS and physical therapy, as such we sought to determine whether taVNS administered during robotic training, specifically delivered during the premotor planning stage for arm extension movements, would confer additional motor improvement in patients with chronic stroke. Thirty-six patients with chronic, moderate-severe upper limb hemiparesis (>6 months; mean Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer score = 25  2, range 13C48), were randomized to receive 9 sessions (1 h in length, 3x/week for 3 weeks) of active (N = 18) or sham (N = 18) taVNS (500 ms bursts, frequency 30 Hz, pulse width 0.3 ms, max intensity 5 mA, 250 stimulated movements per session) delivered during robotic training. taVNS was triggered by the onset of a visual cue prior to center-out arm extension movements. Clinical assessments and surface electromyography (sEMG) measures of the biceps and triceps brachii were collected during separate test sessions. Significant motor improvements were measured for both the active and sham taVNS groups, and these improvements were robust at 3 month follow-up. Compared to the sham group, the active taVNS group showed a significant reduction in spasticity of the wrist and hand at discharge (Modified Tardieu Scale; taVNS = C8.94% vs. sham = + 2.97%, p < 0.05). The EMG results also demonstrated significantly increased variance for the bicep peak sEMG amplitude during extension for the active taVNS group compared to the sham group at discharge (active = 26.29% MVC  3.89, sham = 10.63% MVC  3.10, mean absolute change admission to discharge, p < 0.01), and at 3-month follow-up, the bicep peak sEMG amplitude was significantly reduced in the active taVNS group (P < 0.05). Thus, robot training improved the motor capacity of both groups, and taVNS, decreased spasticity. taVNS administered during premotor planning of movement may play a role in improving coordinated activation of the agonist-antagonist upper arm muscle groups by mitigating spasticity and increasing motor control following stroke.

CVST usually occurs young adults with a female predominance. The current mainstay for treating CVST is anticoagulation with heparin. However, more aggressive interventions, endovascular treatment as an example, may be indicated in selected patients who are non-responsive to heparin and other anticoagulants. Endovascular approaches include catheter-based local chemical thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty and mechanical thrombectomy, all of which may rapidly recanalize the occluded venous sinus, restore the blood flow, reduce the increased intracranial pressure, and subsequently relieve the corresponding symptoms. However, as an invasive strategy, endovascular procedures per se may cause complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, vessel dissection and pulmonary embolization, which may substantially decrease the benefit-risk ratio of the treatment. Due to the rareness of the condition and the limited indication of this invasive strategy, safety and efficacy of endovascular procedures in treating CVST are less feasible to be evaluated in large randomized clinical trails. Therefore, the evidences for justifying this treatment strategy are largely derived from case reports, cohort studies and clinical observations.","output":"Endovascular treatments for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1055/s-011-50355.].","output":"Erratum: Special Virtual Symposium of the North American Skull Base Society."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted wellness strategies aimed at mitigating the pre-existing epidemic of burnout in radiology.

Based on analysis of 185 picture books published in the U.S. between 1999 and 2019, I argue that home as typically represented in childrens picture books presents a limited and privileged view that normalizes single-family homes, material possessions, and related middle-class experiences.

It included the brief illness perception questionnaire, items assessing sociodemographic, lifestyle and health factors and a discrete choice experiment incorporating six attributes of health checks (written results, notification method, consultation time, waiting time, lifestyle recommendation and cost). Associations between illness perceptions and sociodemographic- and cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed using multivariate linear regression. Preference data were analyzed with a mixed multinomial logit model. Presence of smoking, hypertension, obesity and lack of physical activity were associated with weaker causal beliefs for the relevant risk factor, while presence of a high stress level was associated with stronger causal beliefs for stress. Low control predicted unwillingness to receive lifestyle recommendations. Attributing family history as the most important personal cause of MI predicted unwillingness to participate in health checks. Illness perceptions differed due to presence of risk factors, age, sex and health literacy. Furthermore, illness perceptions influenced preferences for health check test results and willingness to participate in health checks.

Firstly, considering that a linguistic term means different things to different decision makers (DMs), a new definition of distance between probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is defined considering the PIS of a DM. Then, a consistency-driven optimization model is built to determine the PIS of linguistic terms in a PLPR of a DM by maximizing the consistency of a PLPR. DMs weights can be acquired through a programming model by minimizing the distance between the individual semantic and the collective semantic. Besides, a clustering algorithm based on PIS is devised for dividing DMs into several subgroups with similar semantic. Based on the obtained subgroups, the corresponding moderators can be identified by DMs with unacceptable consensus level (CL). Several minimum preference adjustment models are constructed to obtain the adjusted PLPRs. These models not only can sufficiently consider the willingness of DMs to modify their preferences but also can improve their CLs in CRP. Finally, an illustration example of selection of college COVID-19 surveillance plans with exemplary data is offered to demonstrate the proposed method and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.","output":"Personalized individual semantics based consensus reaching process for large-scale group decision making with probabilistic linguistic preference relations and application to COVID-19 surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombotic occlusions of blood vessels are responsible for life-threatening cardiovascular disorders such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism.

Numerous randomized trials have required changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but guidance for reporting such modifications is incomplete. Objective As a joint extension for the CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting guidelines, CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances) aims to improve reporting of trial protocols and completed trials that undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances. Evidence A panel of 37 international trial investigators, patient representatives, methodologists and statisticians, ethicists, funders, regulators, and journal editors convened to develop the guideline. The panel developed CONSERVE following an accelerated, iterative process between June 2020 and February 2021 involving (1) a rapid literature review of multiple databases (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL) and gray literature sources from 2003 to March 2021; (2) consensus-based panelist meetings using a modified Delphi process and surveys; and (3) a global survey of trial stakeholders. Findings The rapid review yielded 41 673 citations, of which 38 titles were relevant, including emerging guidance from regulatory and funding agencies for managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trials. However, no generalizable guidance for all circumstances in which trials and trial protocols might face unanticipated modifications were identified. The CONSERVE panel used these findings to develop a consensus reporting guidelines following 4 rounds of meetings and surveys. Responses were received from 198 professionals from 34 countries, of whom 90% (n = 178) indicated that they understood the concept definitions and 85.4% (n = 169) indicated that they understood and could use the implementation tool. Feedback from survey respondents was used to finalize the guideline and confirm that the guideline's core concepts were applicable and had utility for the trial community. CONSERVE incorporates an implementation tool and checklists tailored to trial reports and trial protocols for which extenuating circumstances have resulted in important modifications to the intended study procedures. The checklists include 4 sections capturing extenuating circumstances, important modifications, responsible parties, and interim data analyses.

The objective of this systematic review was to examine how combinations of physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep duration relate to depressive symptoms and other mental health indicators among children and adolescents. METHODS Literature was obtained through searching Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus up to September 30, 2019. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included if they met the following criteria: population (apparently healthy children and adolescents with a mean age of 5-17 years), intervention/exposure (combinations of physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep duration), and outcomes (depressive symptoms and other mental health indicators). A risk of bias assessment was completed for all included studies using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence for each health indicator. Narrative syntheses were employed to describe the results due to high levels of heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS A total of 13 cross-sectional studies comprised in 10 papers met inclusion criteria. Data across studies involved 115,540 children and adolescents from 12 countries. Overall, the findings indicated favourable associations between meeting all 3 recommendations and better mental health indicators among children and adolescents when compared with meeting none of the recommendations.

The analysis was conducted in Smart PLS 3.0, and the goodness of fit (GoF) calculated for this model was 0.63, larger than the required 0.38 for a robust and accurate result. This model was implemented in a sample manufacturing company to seek improvement. Regarding this effort, several improvements were added as input by the manufacturing players to enhance the model. ? 2021.

Workers were forced to minimize commuting to their workplaces, older adults were banned from using meeting facilities, and children were prohibited from going to school. The consequent lack of exercise, accumulated stress, and reduced well-being are likely to have become problems, which may be improved by using urban green spaces (UGS). This study clarified the characteristics of users of UGS in Tokyo during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on telecommuters, older adults, and families with children. An online questionnaire survey was conducted among Tokyo residents, and 3085 responses were obtained. A binomial logistic regression analysis was conducted with the use and evaluation of UGS as the objective variables. The results showed that older adults and families with children who had been using UGS before the pandemic and telecommuters who newly started using UGS during the pandemic used UGS differently. Older adults and families with children tended to use small parks and appreciated human connections. Telecommuters often used greenways, temples, and shrines, valuing stress-reducing functions. Given that a changing lifestyle brings new UGS users new preferences, urban planners should consider that UGS require change with the time.","output":"Use of Urban Green Spaces in the Context of Lifestyle Changes during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Tokyo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the final months of 2019 had the health officials declare a public emergency raising a global response. In response to the burden of the current pandemic, strict measurements were globally implemented to stop further transmission of the virus. These Measurements rely on an accurate diagnosis of individuals infected with the virus by using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The goal of our study is to relate the fundamental clinical and analytical performance of chosen kits of RT-PCR from distinct manufacturers. Methods: A total of 94 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal clinical samples were selected randomly, these samples were previously confirmed as 64 positives, and 30 negatives for SARS-COV-2. Generally, 400 l of each respiratory specimen was subjected to extraction using ExiPrep 96 Viral RNA Kit with the ExiPrep 96 Lite Automated NA Purification System. All kits master mix preparation, cycling protocol, and results interpretation were carried out according to the manufactures instructions of use and recommendations. Results: In our study, we were able to evaluate the performance of 12 commercial kits in detecting SARS-COV-2 using 5 different targets. The performance of the kits was comparable except for LYRA kit as it was less sensitive (F=67, P <0.001). Particularly, the performance of RealStar, BGI, DiaPlexQ, Genesig, LightMix, TaqPath, and RADI kits were the most sensitive. Moreover, the performance of these commercial kits by gene target showed no significant change in Ct values which indicates that kits disparities are mainly linked to the choice of the gene target (F=0.49, P=0.73). Conclusion: We believe that most of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 patients. Moreover, we recommend that regardless of the laboratory choice of diagnostic commercial kit for the clinical detection of COVID-19 patients the need a for good plan for validation and collaboration with exterior laboratories is essential in order to monitor the virus changes overtime, procedures, technicians, and the different kits performances.","output":"Assessment of 12 Quantitative RT-PCR Commercial Kits for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antecedentes: Tanto la sobreinfeccin bacteriana como la neumona asociada a la ventilacin (NAV) son eventos frecuentes en los cuidados crticos.

The time and location of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds officially confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health from 2005 to 2019 were collected. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and multidistance spatial agglomeration analysis methods were used to analyze the global outbreak sites of H5N1. Combined with remote sensing data, the correlation between H5N1 outbreaks and environmental factors was analyzed using binary logistic regression methods. We analyzed the correlation between the H5N1 outbreak and environmental factors and finally made a risk prediction for the global H5N1 outbreaks. The results show that the peak of the H5N1 outbreaks occurs in winter and spring. H5N1 outbreaks exhibit aggregation, and a weak aggregation phenomenon is noted on the scale close to 5000 km.

The mechanisms underlying its development remain poorly understood. Usually neurotropic viruses trigger acute host immune response by engaging cell surface or intracellular receptors. Here, we show that EV71 engagement with intracellular receptor TLR9 elicits IL-12p40-iNOS signaling causing encephalitis in mice. We identified IL-12p40 to be the only prominent cytokine-induced at the early infection stage in the brainstem of mice subjected to a lethal dose of EV71. The upregulated IL-12p40 proteins were expressed in glial cells but not neuronal cells. To better understand the role of IL-12p40 in severe EV71 infection, we treated the EV71-infected mice with an antibody against IL-12p40 and found the mortality rate, brainstem inflammation, and gliosis to be markedly reduced, suggesting that the acute IL-12p40 response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of brainstem encephalitis. Mechanistically, intracellular TLR9 was found essential to the activation of the IL-12p40 response. Blocking TLR9 signaling with CpG-ODN antagonist ameliorated IL-12p40 response, brainstem inflammation, and limb paralysis in mice with EV71-induced encephalitis. We further found the glial IL-12p40 response might damage neurons by inducing excess production of neurotoxic NO by iNOS. Overall, EV71 engagement with intracellular TLR9 was found to elicit a neurotoxic glial response via IL12p40-iNOS signaling contributing to the neurological manifestation of EV71 infection.

To date, no uniform recommendations or diagnostic protocols for long-COVID patients have been developed. This article presents the preliminary results of the examination of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection who were provided with medical telemonitoring devices in order to oversee their pulmonological and cardiological health. Three cases have been analyzed. Each patient underwent a 10-day registration of basic vital signs, in three 15-min sessions daily: RR (respiratory rate), ECG (electrocardiogram), HR (pulse), SPO(2) (saturation), body temperature and cough. Rule methods and machine learning were employed to automatically detect events. As a result, serious disorders of all the three patients were detected: cardiological and respiratory disorders that required extended diagnostics. Furthermore, average values of the selected parameters (RR, HR, SPO(2)) were calculated for every patient, including an indication of how often they exceeded the alarm thresholds. In conclusion, monitoring parameters in patients using telemedicine, especially in a time of limited access to the healthcare system, is a valuable clinical instrument. It enables medical professionals to recognize conditions which may endanger a patients health or life. Telemedicine provides a reliable assessment of a patients health status made over a distance, which can alleviate a patients stress caused by long-COVID syndrome.

Only high negative schizotypal individuals were compared with controls due to the limited number of participants falling in the other schizotypal groups at follow-up. Seventy participants (mean age: 36.17; 70% females) were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Schizotypal traits were evaluated with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. We found that schizotypal traits decreased over time, except in a sub-group of participants (schizotypy congruent) that includes individuals who consistently meet normative criteria of inclusion in either a schizotypal or control group. In these individuals, negative schizotypy and aspects of cognitive-perceptual and disorganized schizotypy remained stable. The stability of cognitive functioning also varied over time: response inhibition, aspects of cued attention switching, set-shifting and phonemic/semantic verbal fluency improved at follow-up. High negative schizotypy at baseline predicted poorer response inhibition and semantic switching at follow-up while high disorganized schizotypy predicted poorer semantic processing and complex processing speed/set-shifting. The between-group analyses revealed that response inhibition, set-shifting and complex processing speed/set-shifting were poorer in negative schizotypals compared with controls at both time points, while maintaining set and semantic switching were poorer only at follow-up. Taken together, the findings show differential stability of the schizotypal traits over time and indicate that different aspects of schizotypy predict a different pattern of neuropsychological task performance during a 4-years time window.

Although promising, the efficiency of Fenton reaction in tumor regions is highly limited by the inefficient delivery of Fenton reagents and the restrictive conditions of tumor microenvironment. One promising strategy against the above limitations is to specifically increase the temperature around the tumor regions. In this study, a novel NIR light-mediated tumor-specific nanoplatform based on magnetic iron oxide nanoclusters (MNCs) was rationally designed and well developed for photothermally enhanced Fenton reaction-assisted oncotherapy. MNCs could accumulate into the tumor regions with the help of an external magnet field to enable T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of tumors and MR imaging-guided combined antitumor therapy. Our well-prepared MNCs also revealed excellent photothermal effect upon a NIR light irradiation, promising their further important role as a photothermal therapy (PTT) agent. More importantly, heat induced by the PTT of MNCs could accelerate the release of Fe from MNCs and enhance the efficiency of Fenton reaction under H(2)O(2)-enriched acidic tumor microenvironment. Results based on long-term toxicity investigations demonstrated the overall safety of MNCs after intravenous injection.

Operando synchrotron long-duration X-ray diffraction enabled by a laser-thinned coin cell shows the emergence and growth in the concentration of this fatigued phase with cycle number. This degradation is structure driven and is not solely due to kinetic limitations or intergranular cracking: no bulk phase transformations, no increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing and no notable changes in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk are seen in aged NMCs. Instead, we propose that this degradation stems from the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure that develops when the latter is at states of charge above a distinct threshold of approximately 75%.

Our study of covalent inhibitors of cysteine proteases indicates that in the choice of an effective warhead it is crucial to focus on the exothermicity of the point on the free energy surface of a peptide cleavage that connects the acylation and deacylation steps. Overall, we believe that our approach should provide a powerful and effective method for in silico design of covalent drugs.","output":"Exploring the Mechanism of Covalent Inhibition: Simulating the Binding Free Energy of -Ketoamide Inhibitors of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a need to introduce video telemedicine for outpatients as an emergency measure without widespread stakeholder consultation. The patient and clinician experience of video outpatient consultation during the peak of the pandemic was studied for acceptability and to gather recommendations to improve the service during continuing infection control measures. Methods Outpatient video telemedicine was introduced over a 14-day period including the provision of equipment, systems integration and stakeholder communication. Patient and clinician experience were measured between 15 April 2020 and 5 May 2020. Results A total of 43 patients and 79 clinicians provided feedback. Of the patients, 86% were above the age of 30 years, with the largest patient group aged 51-70 years. Patient experience was positive. All (100%) patients found joining the video consultation easy; 93% of them recommended to use it for future consultations. Clinician satisfaction was >90% with sound and video quality. Patients were less satisfied than clinicians in that they had communicated everything they wanted to (86% versus 95%). All (100%) patients thought that the video telemedicine solution met their needs, but 25% of clinicians believed that the patient experience of a video consultation was worse than a face-to-face clinic appointment. The three significant factors identified for introducing video consultations were successful IT, improved patient experience and digital healthcare records. Conclusions In the COVID-19 crisis, video telemedicine played a central role in outpatient consultations with excellent levels of success. With some differences in satisfaction level, clinicians significantly underestimate the level of patient satisfaction with outpatient video consultation.","output":"Agile Application of Video Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the initial COVID-19 outbreak up to 28.4 million elective operations were cancelled worldwide, in part owing to concerns that it would be unsustainable to maintain elective surgery capacity because of COVID-19-related surgeon absence. Although many hospitals are now recovering, surgical teams need strategies to prepare for future outbreaks. This study aimed to develop a framework to predict elective surgery capacity during future COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: An international cross-sectional study determined real-world COVID-19-related absence rates among surgeons. COVID-19-related absences included sickness, self-isolation, shielding, and caring for family. To estimate elective surgical capacity during future outbreaks, an expert elicitation study was undertaken with senior surgeons to determine the minimum surgical staff required to provide surgical services while maintaining a range of elective surgery volumes (0, 25, 50 or 75 per cent). RESULTS: Based on data from 364 hospitals across 65 countries, the COVID-19-related absence rate during the initial 6 weeks of the outbreak ranged from 20.5 to 24.7 per cent (mean average fortnightly). In weeks 7C12, this decreased to 9.2C13.8 per cent. At all times during the COVID-19 outbreak there was predicted to be sufficient surgical staff available to maintain at least 75 per cent of regular elective surgical volume. Overall, there was predicted capacity for surgeon redeployment to support the wider hospital response to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This framework will inform elective surgical service planning during future COVID-19 outbreaks. In most settings, surgeon absence is unlikely to be the factor limiting elective surgery capacity.","output":"COVID-19-related absence among surgeons: development of an international surgical workforce prediction model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, reminiscent of cytokine release syndrome, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ damage in patients with COVID-19. Agents that inhibit components of the pro-inflammatory cascade have garnered interest as potential treatment options with hopes that dampening the pro-inflammatory process may improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib is a reversible Janus-associated kinase (JAK)-inhibitor that interrupts the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in COVID-19 immunopathology. It may also have antiviral effects by targeting host factors that viruses rely for cell entry and by suppressing type I interferon driven angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 up regulation. However, baricitinib's immunosuppressive effects may be detrimental during acute viral infections by delaying viral clearance and increasing vulnerability to secondary opportunistic infections. The lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor patients' immune status as illness evolves complicates deployment of immunosuppressive drugs like baricitinib. Furthermore, baricitinib carries the risk of increased thromboembolic events which is concerning given the proclivity towards a hyper-coagulable state in COVID-19 patients. In this article we review available data on baricitinib with an emphasis on immunosuppressive and antiviral pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.","output":"Baricitinib: A review of pharmacology, safety and emerging clinical experience in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults are at greater risk for becoming severely ill from COVID-19; however, the impact of the pandemic on their economic activity and non-COVID-19-related healthcare utilisation is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related unemployment and healthcare utilisation in a sample of older adults across 27 European countries. METHODS: We used data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe COVID-19 Survey, collected between June and August 2020. Participants (n=52 061) reported whether they lost a job, forwent medical treatment and whether their appointment was postponed due to COVID-19. Three-level models were estimated for each outcome to test the effects of individual, household and country-level characteristics. RESULTS: The mean prevalence of reported job loss, and forgone and postponed medical care was 19%, 12% and 26%, respectively. Job loss was associated with female sex, lower education and household income, and older age in women. For example, the OR of job loss, comparing primary versus tertiary (college) education, was 1.89 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.26). Forgone and postponed medical care was associated with older age in men, female sex and higher education. At the country level, postponed medical care was associated with more stringent governmental anti-COVID measures. CONCLUSION: Job loss and lower healthcare utilisation for non-COVID-19-related reasons were common among older adults and were associated with several sociodemographic characteristics. Job loss appeared to disproportionally affect already economically vulnerable individuals, raising concerns about the exacerbation of social inequalities.","output":"Job loss and lower healthcare utilisation due to COVID-19 among older adults across 27 European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The furin cleavage site plays an important role in virus pathogenicity. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site insertion in contrast to SARS-CoV, which may be related to its stronger communicability. An avian coronavirus with an extra furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2' site) infected monocyte cells and neuron cells leading to viremia or encephalitis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells. TNF-&#945;, which has a key role in blood-brain barrier permeability, was highly induced by avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site compared with the parent avian coronavirus. We demonstrated the process involved in mutant avian coronavirus-induced disease and that the addition of a furin-S2' site changed the virus cell tropism.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses have broken out three times in two decades. Spike (S) protein plays a key role in the process of infection. To clarify importance of furin cleavage site in spike protein for coronavirus, we investigated the pathogenesis of neurotropic avian coronavirus whose spike protein contains an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2' site). By combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects brain instead of trachea when its S protein contains furin-S2' site. Moreover, the virus was shown to increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, infect neuron cells and induce high expression of TNF-&#945;. Based on these results we further show that furin cleavage site in S protein plays an important role in coronavirus pathogenicity and cell tropism.

RNAs prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT) allow transient expression of proteins of interest, conferring safety over DNA- or virus-mediated gene delivery systems. However, in vitro-transcribed RNAs should be used with caution because of their immunogenicity, which is in part triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) byproducts during IVT. Cellular innate immune response to dsRNA byproducts can lead to undesirable consequences, including suppression of protein synthesis and cell death, which in turn can detrimentally impact the efficacy of mRNA therapy. Thus, it is critical to understand the nature of IVT byproducts and the mechanisms by which they trigger innate immune responses.Our lab has been investigating the mechanisms by which the innate immune system discriminates between \\"self\\" and \\"nonself\\" RNA, with the focus on the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated 5 (MDA5). We have biochemically and structurally characterized critical events involving RNA discrimination and signal transduction by RIG-I or MDA5. We have used in vitro-transcribed RNAs as tools to investigate RNA specificity of RIG-I and MDA5, which required optimization of the IVT reaction and purification processes to eliminate the effect of IVT byproducts.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize changes in the clinical content of ambulatory care among office-based vs telemedicine encounters in the US before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis of serial cross-sectional data from the IQVIA National Disease and Therapeutic Index was a 2-stage, stratified nationally representative audit of outpatient care in the US from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020. The National Disease and Therapeutic Index generates approximately 33 617 quarterly visits that are projected to 306.7 million national visits based on the survey design. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: (1) Prevalence of common diagnoses and (2) mix of long-term, short-term, and preventive care. RESULTS: The mean (SD) number of projected quarterly, in-person, office-based visits was 282.1 (1.4) million in 2018 and 284.7 (10.3) in 2019 before declining to 250.8 million in quarter 1 of 2020 and 147.8 million in quarter 2 of 2020 and then increasing moderately to 181.5 million in quarter 3 of 2020 and 180.2 million in quarter 4 of 2020. The mean (SD) number of telemedicine visits was 2.8 (0.4) million in 2018 and 3.0 (0.1) million in 2019 before increasing to 8.6 million in quarter 1 of 2020 and 72.2 million in quarter 2 of 2020 and then declining notably to 43.8 million in quarter 3 of 2020 and 44.2 million in quarter 4 of 2020. Office-based care during the second through fourth quarters of 2020 involved 58.0% long-term, 23.0% short-term, and 25.6% preventive care. In contrast to office-based care, 4 of the top 10 diagnoses that were treated by telemedicine during 2020 were for psychiatric or behavioral conditions: depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Throughout this period, approximately half of office-based visits and nearly two-thirds of telemedicine visits were for established rather than new patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional studys findings suggest that while telemedicine rapidly increased early during course of the COVID-19 pandemic, its use declined modestly since then. In contrast to office-based care, telemedicine was more commonly used for established patients and substantially greater delivery of psychiatric or behavioral treatments rather than preventive care.","output":"Changes in Short-term, Long-term, and Preventive Care Delivery in US Office-Based and Telemedicine Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Mexicos public hospitals are experiencing major operational problems which seriously affect the care of Mexican citizens.

Yet, existing systematic reviews of garden-based interventions often focus on one particular health outcome or setting, creating a need to holistically summarize review-level evidence on the role of garden-based interventions in early childhood. To fill this gap, we performed an umbrella review of garden-based interventions to examine their role in early childhood health promotion for children ages 6 years and younger, examining effective components of garden-based interventions and critically evaluating existing evidence. METHODS We searched the following databases: PubMed, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, OVID-Agricola, and CAB Direct, limiting to reviews published from 1990 to August 2019. Of the 9457 references identified, we included a total of 16 unique reviews for analysis. RESULTS Across reviews, garden based-interventions were most effective at improving nutrition-related outcomes for children, including nutritional status and fruit and vegetable consumption. Few reviews examined child health outcomes of garden-based interventions that were not nutrition related, such as physical activity, or academic performance. Across settings, there was the most evidence in support of garden-based interventions conducted in home gardens, compared to evidence from early care and education or community settings. We were unable to report on most effective components of garden-based interventions due to limitations of included reviews. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence is difficult to interpret due to methodological limitations at both the review and primary study level. Therefore, the lack of evidence for certain child health outcomes should not necessarily be interpreted as an absence of an effect of garden-based interventions for specific outcomes, but as a product of these limitations. Given the breadth of evidence for garden-based interventions to improve a number of dimensions of health with older children and adult populations, we highlight areas of future research to address evidence gaps identified in this umbrella review. Further research on the role of garden-based interventions, including their impact on non-nutrition early childhood health outcomes and how effectiveness differs by setting type is necessary to fully understand their role in early childhood health promotion.

We postulate that group-based Sleep Apnea Management (SAM) clinic, which harnesses the benefits of providing mutual support as well as facilitates access to system-based resources and education, will confer improvements in PAP adherence. METHODS: Data from SAM clinic attendees from January 2017 to June 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Adherence data at SAM baseline visit and 1-3 months follow-up were collected. Average PAP usage from all-days and days used were analyzed along with demographics, co-morbidities, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Adherence was defined as >4 hours a night for 70% of nights over a 30-day period. Key structural elements of the SAM group clinic model were co-presence of the OSA care team members and peer group support. Key efficiency elements were group education and the prompt-to-patient multidisciplinary troubleshooting adherence barriers. RESULTS: Of 110 SAM clinic attendees, average age was 60.912.7 years, 53% were men, and 46% Caucasian. At baseline, the mean for average-all-days usage was 4.2 hours, mean average-days-used usage was 5.2 hours, and mean percentage-of-days usage 4 hours was 57%. At follow-up, the mean average-all-days usage increased 1.2 hours (p<0.001), mean average-days-used usage increased 0.8 hours (p<0.001), and the mean percentage-of-days with usage 4 hours increased 16% (p<0.001).

During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals' adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups. A sample of 1000 adults aged &#8805;18 years who are representative of the population of the United States by gender, race and ethnicity, and age will be randomly assigned (via a 1:1 allocation) to an intervention or a placebo-control arm. The intervention will be a digital infographic with content based on principles of trust in science, developed by a health communications expert. The intervention will then be both pretested and pilot-tested to determine its viability. Study outcomes will include trust in science, a COVID-19 narrative belief latent profile membership, and the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors, which will be controlled by 8 theoretically selected covariates.

We categorized patients into receiving either aggressive local therapy (ALT) or non-aggressive treatment (NT). We identified borough of residence through NYSPACED and used Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) designation to define neighborhood characteristics using United States Census data. We hypothesized that differences exist in use of ALT according to county of residence and neighborhood characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to test the association between county of residence and ALT as well as between ALT and PUMA characteristics. RESULTS Our cohort included 40,668 patients. Overall, 80% had ALT, and 21% had NT. NT use increased over time from 16% in 2004 to 32% in 2016 (P < .001).

RESULTS: Four themes were identified with respect to HCWs' experience of pandemic PPE: 1. Risk, fear and uncertainty: HCWs experienced considerable fear and heightened personal and professional risk, reporting anxiety about the adequacy of PPE and the resultant risk to themselves and their families. 2. Evidence and the ambiguities of evolving guidelines: forms of evidence, its interpretation, and the perception of rapidly changing guidelines heightened distress amongst HCWs. 3. Trust and care: Access to PPE signified organisational support and care, and restrictions on PPE use were considered a breach of trust. 4. Non-compliant practice in the context of social upheaval: despite communication of evidence-based guidelines, an environment of mistrust, personal risk, and organisational uncertainty resulted in variable compliance. CONCLUSION: PPE preferences and usage offer a material signifier of the broader, evolving pandemic context, reflecting HCWs' fear, mistrust, sense of inequity and social solidarity (or breakdown). PPE therefore represents the affective (emotional) demands of professional care, as well as a technical challenge of infection prevention and control. If rationing of PPE is necessary, policymakers need to take account of how HCWs will perceive restrictions or conflicting recommendations and build trust through effective communication (including of uncertainty).","output":"One minute it's an airborne virus, then it's a droplet virus, and then it's like nobody really knows: Experiences of pandemic PPE amongst Australian healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic presents a unique set of risk exposures to populations, which may lead to an increase in suicide While large-scale traumatic events are known to increase psychological disorders, thus far the science has not shown a clear link between these events and suicide In their paper in this issue, Elbogen and colleagues (Am J Epidemiol 2020;(XX):XXXX-XXXX) use representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to show that four dimensions of financial strain-financial debt/crisis, unemployment, past homelessness, lower income-are associated with subsequent suicide attempts There are three main learnings we may take from Elbogen et al: first, with populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic Second, these data show the centrality of financial stressors, marking the current moment as distinct from other disasters or large-scale trauma Third, the data teach us that financial stressors are linked, and cumulative In this way, the paper is a sobering harbinger of the potential effects on suicide of the collective stressors borne by the Covid-19 pandemic and other mass traumatic events that are accompanied by substantial financial stressors","output":"Reckoning With the Relation Between Stressors and Suicide Attempts in a Time of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The suppressing effects of inert nanoparticles on methane-air explosion, in an obstructed chamber with internal dimensions of 150 mm  150 mm  500 mm, were experimentally investigated. To this end, the flame behaviors in the presence of obstacles as well as overpressure transients during the explosions with and without nanoparticles were compared. Additionally, the effects of density, diameter, and material of nanoparticles on the suppressing behaviors were analyzed as well. The results showed that the methane-air deflagrating flame remains generally light blue if the nanoparticles are added. In particular, the flame obstacle interaction may enhance the suppression effect of the nanoparticles, and the flame acceleration rate and the peak overpressure decrease significantly. Increasing explosion suppression is seen up to about 100 g m-3 particle density, but further increase in particle density, up to 150 g m-3, yields no further increase in the explosion suppression ability. And as the particle size decreases, the suppressing effect is more evident. The experiments also showed that Al(OH)3, Mg(OH)2, and SiO2 all can be used to suppress the flame propagation and overpressure. However, the metal hydroxides suppress the methane explosions even more efficiently than SiO2 particles; Al(OH)3 particles have a slightly better inhibiting effect than Mg(OH)2.

In response to these needs, we codeveloped the Healthy Parent Carers (HPC) programme. This study examined the views and experiences of participants in the HPC feasibility trial to inform programme refinement. INTERVENTION, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: HPC is a peer-led group-based intervention (supported by online materials) for primary carers of disabled children, encouraging behaviours linked with health and well-being. It was delivered by two lead and six assistant peer facilitators in six community sites (one lead and one assistant per group) in South West England over six or 12 sessions. Control participants had online materials only. The trial involved 47 intervention and 45 control parent carers (97% female and 97% white) and eight facilitators (one male). DESIGN: A preplanned mixed methods process evaluation using questionnaires and checklists (during and after the intervention), qualitative interviews with participants after intervention (n=18) and a focus group with facilitators after trial. RESULTS: HPC was highly acceptable to participants and facilitators and experiences were very positive. Participants reported that the programme increased awareness of what parent carers could and could not change and their self-efficacy to engage in health-promoting behaviours. The intended mechanisms of action (social identification and peer support) matched participants expectations and experiences. Control participants found the online-only programme flexible but isolating, as there were no opportunities to share ideas and problem solve with peers, the key function of the programme. Areas for improvement were identified for programme content, facilitator training and delivery. CONCLUSION: HPC was acceptable, well received and offers considerable potential to improve the health of parent carers. Under the pandemic, the challenge going forward is how best to maintain reach and fidelity to function while delivering a more virtual programme.

Accurate knowledge of their structure is central to understanding their antigen-binding function. The key area for antigen binding and the main area of structural variation in antibodies are concentrated in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the most important for binding and most variable being the CDR-H3 loop. The sequence and structural variability of CDR-H3 make it particularly challenging to model. Recently deep learning methods have offered a step change in our ability to predict protein structures. RESULTS: In this work, we present ABlooper, an end-to-end equivariant deep learning-based CDR loop structure prediction tool. ABlooper rapidly predicts the structure of CDR loops with high accuracy and provides a confidence estimate for each of its predictions. On the models of the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, ABlooper makes predictions with an average CDR-H3 RMSD of 2.49 ?, which drops to 2.05 ? when considering only its 75% most confident predictions.

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","output":"Prediction of Personal Protective Equipment Use in Hospitals During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives. The study is aimed at evaluating knowledge, attitude, and barriers to telemedicine among the general population in Egypt. Methods. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional design was carried out among the general Egyptian population. A convenience sampling method was used to approach the eligible participants from University Teaching Hospitals of eight governorates from May to July 2020. Results. A total of 686 participants filled the questionnaire (49.4% were males, mean age 36.711.2 years old). Half of the participants stated that they previously used a telemedicine tool, mainly to follow up laboratory results (67.3%). Video or phone calls (39.3%) and mobile applications (23.7%) were the most commonly recognized telemedicine tools by the participants. The included participants exhibited a high level of knowledge and attitude towards telemedicine. On the other hand, 21.9% stated that telemedicine services could jeopardize patient privacy. 32.8% reported that telemedicine service could lead to disclosing medical information to people who are not authorized to do so. Almost half of the participants agreed to strongly agreed that telemedicine service could increase medical errors. 60.80% of the participants said that they are more likely to prefer telemedicine than traditional ways. However, 13.70% stated that telemedicine is more likely to be challenging to use. Conclusion. The Egyptian population has high knowledge about the applications of telemedicine. In addition, the vast majority of Egyptians appear to perceive the benefits of telemedicine positively and are willing to use it. However, some barriers that have been found must be taken into consideration to adopt telemedicine successfully, especially for people who are old, are low educated, and live in remote areas.

This study was done to estimate the prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 using various screening questionnaires and to assess effect of OSA on outcome of disease. METHODOLOGY: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 were screened for OSA by different questionnaires (STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire, NoSAS, and Epworth Scale). Association between OSA, outcome (mortality) and requirement for respiratory support was assessed. RESULTS: In study of 213 patients; screening questionnaires for OSA [STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), NoSAS] were more likely to be positive in patients who died compared to patients who survived. On binary logistic regression analysis, age  55 and STOPBANG score  5 were found to have small positive but independent effect on mortality even after adjusting for other variables. Proportion of patients who were classified as high risk for OSA by various OSA screening tools significantly increased with increasing respiratory support (p < 0.001 for STOPBANG, BQ, ESS and p = 0.004 for NoSAS).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted and conducted on 200 actively working physicians in Izmir/Turkey. Personal Information Form and Maslach Burnout Inventory were used in the survey. RESULTS: The findings showed that the emotional exhaustion level of the physicians was medium, the levels of depersonalization and personal accomplishment were low, and the level of total burnout was low. It was observed that the burnout levels of males and females, and married and single physicians were similar. The emotional exhaustion level of 18C23-year-old physicians was lower than the rest of the physicians. Physicians level of satisfaction with their income is not effective on burnout. The burnout level of physicians who did not choose their profession willingly was determined to be higher than the burnout level of the physicians who chose their profession willingly. One important finding showed that the burnout level of physicians who actively involved in the fight against COVID-19 was lower than the burnout level of the physicians who did not actively involve in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although the impact of some demographic variables, such as gender, marital status and satisfaction of income on burnout, was similar among the groups, total burnout level was lower in physicians who actively fought with the virus. This result may suggest that those physicians who were actively involved in the fight against COVID-19 had a high sense of meaningfulness of work which will result in high satisfaction with the work itself and, thus, creating less burnout.

We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies - primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic - weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states.

Results: During the pandemic restrictions 61.6% were limited or non-users of the Internet. The majority had access to the Internet and digital devices but around half reported knowledge deficits. Most common activities were accessing information and entertainment (88.9%), staying in touch with friends and families (84.8%), and purchasing goods (other than food) (84.3%).

This study aimed to evaluate both the association of social frailty with the physical function and the efficacy of intradialytic exercise as a therapy for social frailty among hemodialysis patients. Methods: : A total of 16 hemodialysis patients in the hemodialysis department of a single medical center were enrolled in this single-center prospective single-arm interventional study. Patients received five questions which asked about going out infrequently, lack of visiting friends, feeling unhelpful to friends or family, living alone, and lack of talking with someone. Those to whom two or more of the above were applicable were categorized as socially frail. All patients were placed into exercise therapy to be performed during their thrice-weekly hemodialysis visits. Participants physical function (walking speed), muscle strength (grip strength), muscle mass (appendicular skeletal muscle mass index), and social frailty were evaluated at baseline and after three months of therapy. Results: : Four (25%) of the 16 participants (median age 71.5 years, 8 women) were categorized as being socially frail. In comparison to the non-socially frail group (non-SF), the socially frail group (SF) had a significantly lower walking speed (0.70  0.12 m/s vs 1.15  0.26 m/s, p = 0.005) and significantly worse performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery.

CASE PRESENTATION A 73-year-old male former smoker with diagnosis of right lower lobe of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) with multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cT4N2M0, stage IIIB, received salvage right lower lobe + right middle lobe bilobectomy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after dCRT and adjuvant CRT to a total of 9000 cGy dosage of radiation. The interval from the 1st and 2nd ends of radiation to the salvage surgery was 980 and 164 days, respectively. The pre-operative forced expiratory volume in the first second was 2.33 L (101% predicted) and the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide was 56% predicted. The operating time was 6.5 h, and the total estimated blood loss was 50 ml. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day without major complications or bronchopleural fistulas. The patient was still alive 42 months after the initial diagnosis of advanced N2 lung SqCC, and kept progression-free for 7 months after salvage lung resection. CONCLUSIONS Salvage lung resection performed long after high-dose radiation therapy of dCRT is technically feasible through VATS approach in a patient with initially inoperable cT4N2M0 stage IIIB NSCLC, and can be an alternative consolidative treatment for locally advanced NSCLC.","output":"Salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy through VATS for an initial unresectable locally advanced lung cancer: an alternative consolidative modality to radiotherapy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has long been known that Bacillus CalmetteGurin (BCG) vaccine provides nonspecific protection against many non-mycobacterial infections, which has been discussed in the last decade through the prism of the concept of trained immunity. Within the framework of this concept, a persistent increase in resistance to various pathogens, which occurs after an infectious disease or exposure to certain microbial agents, is associated with epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention of scientists and practitioners to BCG as an inducer of trained immunity. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested a negative association between the coverage of the population with BCG vaccination and the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A series of independent clinical studies of the effectiveness of this vaccine in non-specific prevention of COVID-19 has been initiated in different countries. Recently, the key role of cytosolic NOD2 receptors in BCG-induced trained immunity has been proven. This actualizes the search for effective immunoactive preparations for prevention of respiratory infections in the pandemic among low molecular weight peptidoglycan fragments of the bacterial cell wall, muramylpeptides (MPs), which are known to be NOD2 agonists. The review highlights the proven and proposed linkages between BCG, MPs, NOD2 and trained immunity in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the data presented indicates the prospects for preclinical and clinical studies of MPs as potential drugs for nonspecific prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or other respiratory infections in risk groups during the pandemic. First of all, attention should be paid to glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide, approved for clinical use in Russia and a number of post-Soviet countries for the complex treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent respiratory infections.","output":"[BCG, muramylpeptides, trained immunity (part I): linkages in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although nurses struggle with the decision to report for work during disaster events, there are no instruments to measure nurses' duty to care for disaster situations.

PURPOSE: This case report describes utilization of thromboelastography (TEG) in the setting of an acute major bleed in a patient on dabigatran who had concomitant acute kidney injury. SUMMARY: An 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a fall with complaints of pain in her knee, shoulder, and hip. Her medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, for which she took clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and atrial fibrillation, for which she took dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The physical exam was remarkable for pain within the shoulder, hip, and knee, which had swelling and ecchymosis that extended into the right thigh. Given the possibility of compartment syndrome with multiple possible etiologies of coagulopathy, TEG and computed tomography angiography (CTa) of the right lower extremity were performed. The initial TEG showed prolonged R time and activated clotting time, indicating clotting factor dysfunction with no additional coagulopathy noted, including antiplatelet effects. On the basis of the TEG and CTa findings, it was decided to reverse dabigatran with 5 grams of idarucizumab. Approximately 1 hour after administration of idarucizumab, the patient was taken to interventional radiology where a limited angiogram of the right lower extremity showed no active extravasation. Because of the patient's renal dysfunction and the possibility of rebound hypercoaguability, repeat TEG tests were ordered at 4 and 8 hours after the initial reversal to ensure clearance of idarucizumab-dabigatran complexes. The repeat TEG values showed complete reversal of the initial coagulopathy noted. During the admission, the patient required no blood transfusions or surgical interventions and all her initial laboratory results improved. CONCLUSION: Serial TEG testing was successful at managing multiple coagulopathies in a patient at risk for trauma-induced compartment syndrome.","output":"Thromboelastography utilization for dabigatran reversal in a patient with acute kidney injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic pain is of significant global concern. There is growing evidence that bodyCmind therapies and psychological approaches can contribute toward changing chronic pain perceptions. This is the first model described in the literature that combines a mindfulness-based approach with dance movement therapy and explores the potential psychological and pain-related changes for this client population. In this paper, the results from the pilot study are presented involving patients with chronic headache recruited in an outpatient rehabilitation setting. Methods: In this pilot study, 29 patients (n = 29) with chronic headache were randomized to either the Mindful-Based Dance Movement Therapy (MBDMT) group or the waiting list control group (treatment as usual, TAU). The MBDMT group was offered 10 sessions in a clinical outpatient rehabilitation setting for 5 weeks. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention and 16 weeks after the intervention was finished. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire?9 (PHQ-9), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) were used as outcome measures. Results: The working model of MBDMT identifies nine therapeutic mechanisms (safe therapeutic environment, mindfulness skills, body awareness, relaxation/releasing, distancing and staying with discomfort, meaning making, self-regulation, acceptance and integration, creative process). Per-protocol analysis reveals statistically significant reduction of pain intensity and depression scores in favor of the MBDMT group, and these improvements were maintained in the follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The results suggest that MBDMT is a feasible and promising therapy approach for chronic pain patients. The pilot study offered sufficient information and preliminary results in the desirable direction to enable the researchers to move to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) stage in order to establish the efficacy of the intervention.

Sequencing the viral genome as the outbreak progresses is important, particularly in the identification of emerging isolates with different pathogenic potential and to identify whether nucleotide changes in the genome will impair clinical diagnostic tools such as real-time PCR assays. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms and point mutations occur during the replication of coronaviruses, one of the biggest drivers in genetic change is recombination. This can manifest itself in insertions and/or deletions in the viral genome. Therefore, sequencing strategies that underpin molecular epidemiology and inform virus biology in patients should take these factors into account. A long amplicon/read length-based RT-PCR sequencing approach focused on the Oxford Nanopore MinION/GridION platforms was developed to identify and sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome in samples from patients with or suspected of COVID-19. The protocol, termed Rapid Sequencing Long Amplicons (RSLAs) used random primers to generate cDNA from RNA purified from a sample from a patient, followed by single or multiplex PCRs to generate longer amplicons of the viral genome. The base protocol was used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of clinical samples and proved sensitive in identifying viral RNA in samples from patients that had been declared negative using other nucleic acid-based assays (false negative).

Findings: A significant body of literature clearly demonstrates that tourism cannot be viewed simply from an economic point of view as it has a great influence on sociocultural and environmental dimensions. The impact of tourism and how to ensure its long-term success has been invoked for the last few decades, leading to the direct consideration of sustainability indicators in a wide array of scientific publications. However, despite significant advances, the lack of funding, lack of support or interest from the political community, bureaucracies or lack of methodological guidance and of technical skills along the entire value chain pose clear challenges to the development and adoption of wide data systems to support sustainable tourism policies.

This study aims to assess changes in lifestyle and health-related behaviors such as daily habits, dietary habits, physical activity, sleep patterns, psychological problems, and sexual behaviors among the general population in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional web-based survey conducted between January 9 and January 28, 2021, enrolled 403 Lebanese adults. The study questionnaire was developed on Google forms in English and Arabic. It included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19, and behavior changes (smoking, alcohol consumption, sexual and hygiene behaviors, and intake of nutritional supplements and immunity-boosting foods), in addition to three scales, i.e., the Lifestyle and Health Behaviors Changes (LHBC-17), WHO-5 Well-being Index, and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). Data analysis was done on SPSS software version 21. Results The mean age of participants was 29.74  10.81 years, with 51.2% of females. Most participants reported that COVID-19 has profoundly affected their LHBs, whether positively or negatively. Female gender (Beta=-2.336), living in Lebanon (Beta=-7.502), smoking nargileh (Beta=-3.433), having a high BMI (Beta=-0.263), and spending more hours per day using electronic devices during the COVID-19 lockdown (Beta=-0.853) were significantly associated with lower LHBC-17 scores (negative LHB changes).

Mutations in genes encoding components of the Z-disk or Z-disk-associated proteins occur in some patients whereas in most of the cases, the causative gene defect is still unknown. We aimed to search for pathogenic mutations in genes not previously associated with MFM phenotype. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in four patients from three unrelated families who were diagnosed with PAM without aberrations in causative genes for MFM. RESULTS: In the first patient and her affected daughter, we identified a heterozygous p.(Arg89Cys) missense mutation in LMNA gene which has not been linked with PAM pathology before. In the second patient, a heterozygous p.(Asn4807Phe) mutation in RYR1 not previously described in PAM represents a novel, candidate gene with a possible causative role in the disease. Finally, in the third patient and his symptomatic daughter, we found a previously reported heterozygous p.(Cys30071Arg) mutation in TTN gene that was clinically associated with cardiac involvement.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of seven dimensions of safety culture on nurse-rated patient safety and identify the relative importance of these dimensions for predicting patient safety. This correlational study used data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitys 2018 Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Data from 13,031 nurses working in surgical areas of 443 hospitals in the United States were examined using logistic regression and dominance analysis. Staffing adequacy was the strongest predictor of patient safety, followed by hospital management support for patient safety and organizational learning/continuous improvement. However, dominance analysis showed that hospital management support for patient safety was the most important predictor rather than staffing adequacy. Nurse managers and hospital administrators should role model a culture of safety and demonstrate their valuing of patient safety by providing sufficient resources, listening to and valuing staff suggestions regarding patient safety, and providing feedback about organizational changes to improve patient safety.","output":"Using Dominance Analysis to Identify the Most Important Dimensions of Safety Culture for Predicting Patient Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies can significantly improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

For two decades, the medical education establishment in the UK has been challenged to remedy these failings, but little has changed. Meanwhile, there has been an exponential increase in biomedical research and an international paradigm shift in the literature, which defines ME/CFS as a multisystem disease, replacing the psychogenic narrative. This study was designed to explore the current UK medical school education on ME/CFS and to identify challenges and opportunities relating to future ME/CFS medical education. Materials and methods: A questionnaire, developed under the guidance of the Medical Schools Council, was sent to all 34 UK medical schools to collect data for the academic year 2018C2019. Results: Responses were provided by 22 out of a total of 34 medical schools (65%); of these 13/22 (59%) taught ME/CFS, and teaching was led by lecturers from ten medical specialties. Teaching delivery was usually by lecture; discussion, case studies and e-learning were also used. Questions on ME/CFS were included by seven schools in their examinations and three schools reported likely clinical exposure to ME/CFS patients. Two-thirds of respondents were interested in receiving further teaching aids in ME/CFS. None of the schools shared details of their teaching syllabus, so it was not possible to ascertain what the students were being taught. Conclusions: This exploratory study reveals inadequacies in medical school teaching on ME/CFS. Many medical schools (64% of respondents) acknowledge the need to update ME/CFS education by expressing an appetite for further educational materials. The General Medical Council (GMC) and Medical Schools Council (MSC) are called upon to use their considerable influence to bring about the appropriate changes to medical school curricula so future doctors can recognise, diagnose and treat ME/CFS.

Three mutant helicase proteins (two with single point mutations and one with dual mutations) were expressed in Escherichia coli and evaluated for their ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. Both L1110F and V1120I helicase mutants showed marginal decrease in ATPase activity, while L1110F/V1120I dual mutant showed normal ATPase activity. All three mutants proteins showed RNA unwinding activities comparable to wild type protein. Corresponding mutations were made in the helicase domain of HEV RLuc replicon and replication efficiencies were tested in the S10-3 (Huh 7) cells. The mutant replicon V1120I showed lower replication as compared to L1110F and L1110F/V1120I mutants.

LAY SUMMARY: In COVID-19 patients who need medical care in an intensive care unit, the risk of developing bloodstream Candida infection is higher in older patients and in those who have a more severe critical illness. Treatment with steroids or tocilizumab does not seem to affect the risk of candida bloodstream infection in these patients.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for COVID-19-associated Candidemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we propose a mathematical model -- based on a cellular automaton -- for the redistribution of patients within a network of hospitals with limited available resources, in order to reduce the risks of a local/global collapse of the healthcare system. We attempt at developing a conceptual tool to support making rational decisions relevant to the optimisation of the allocation of patients into accessible medical facilities. The strategy is based on a version of the Abelian Sandpile model for the Self-Organised Criticality, with the idea of testing the paradigm for the management of patients among the COVID-19 hospitals in Italian regions. In particular, we compare the novel proposal to the standard management of connections between hospitals, showing a number of advantages at a local and global level, by means of a reliable indicator function introduced for measuring the effectiveness of the allocation strategies.","output":"Hospital management in the COVID-19 emergency: Abelian Sandpile paradigm and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about widespread infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in educational settings. In June 2020, Public Health England (PHE) initiated prospective national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in primary schools across England (sKIDs). We used this opportunity to assess the feasibility and agreeability of large-scale surveillance and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections in school among staff, parents and students. METHODS: Staff and students in 131 primary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire at recruitment and provide weekly nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing (n = 86) or swabs with blood samples for antibody testing (n = 45) at the beginning and end the summer half-term. In six blood sampling schools, students were asked to complete a pictorial questionnaire before and after their investigations. RESULTS: In total, 135 children aged 4C7 years (n = 40) or 8C11 years (n = 95) completed the pictorial questionnaire fully or partially. Prior to sampling, oral fluid sampling was the most acceptable test (107/132, 81%) followed by throat swabs (80/134, 59%), nose swabs (77/132, 58%), and blood tests (48/130, 37%). Younger students were more nervous about all tests than older students but, after completing their tests, most children reported a better than expected experience with all the investigations. Students were more likely to agree to additional testing for nose swabs (93/113, 82%) and oral fluid (93/114, 82%), followed by throat swabs (85/113, 75%) and blood tests (72/108, 67%). Parents (n = 3,994) and staff (n = 2,580) selected a preference for weekly testing with nose swabs, throat swabs or oral fluid sampling, although staff were more flexible about testing frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Primary school staff and parents were supportive of regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and selected a preference for weekly testing. Children preferred nose swabs and oral fluids over throat swabs or blood sampling.","output":"Feasibility and acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance in primary school children in England: Prospective, cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, hundreds of thousands of patients have been treated in ICUs across the globe. The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and activates several distinct inflammatory pathways, resulting in hematologic abnormalities and dysfunction in respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal renal, endocrine, dermatologic, and neurologic systems. This review summarizes the current state of research in coronavirus disease 2019 pathophysiology within the context of potential organ-based disease mechanisms and opportunities for translational research. Data Sources: Investigators from the Research Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine were selected based on expertise in specific organ systems and research focus. Data were obtained from searches conducted in Medline via the PubMed portal, Directory of Open Access Journals, Excerpta Medica database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, and Web of Science from an initial search from December 2019 to October 15, 2020, with a revised search to February 3, 2021. The medRxiv, Research Square, and clinical trial registries preprint servers also were searched to limit publication bias.

We reviewed methods for estimation of national or subnational coverage of RMNCH interventions using HMIS data exclusively or in conjunction with survey data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of studies indexed in PubMed and Scopus to identify potential papers based on predefined search terms. Two reviewers screened the papers using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following sequences of title, abstract and full paper reviews, we retained 18 relevant papers. RESULTS: 12 papers used only HMIS data and 6 used both HMIS and survey data. There is enormous lack of standards in the existing methods for estimating RMNCH intervention coverage; all appearing to be highly author dependent. The denominators for coverage measures were estimated using census, non-census and combined projection-based methods. No satisfactory methods were found for treatment-based coverage indicators for which the estimation of target population requires the population prevalence of underlying conditions. The estimates of numerators for the coverage measures were obtained from the count of users or visits and in some cases correction for completeness of reporting in the HMIS following an assessment of data quality. CONCLUSIONS: Standard methods for correcting numerators from HMIS data for accurate estimation of coverage of RMNCH interventions are needed to expand the use of these data. More research and investments are required to improve denominators for health facility-derived statistics. Improvement in routine data quality and analytical methods would allow for timely estimation of RMNCH intervention coverage at the national and subnational levels.","output":"Estimating population-based coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) interventions from health management information systems: a comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A laboratory experiment was led to examine the lead bioaccumulation capacity of Ludwigia stolonifera (Guill. & Perr.) exposed to various Pb concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L) for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. The lead accumulation increased as the metal concentrations in the solution increased and over time, to an extreme accretion of 6840 mg/kg DW(dry weight) at 100 mg/L of lead on the 10 days exposure. The proportion removal efficiency, translocation factor, and bioconcentration factor of the plant were assessed. The maximum bioconcentration factor values (1981.13) indicate that the plant was a Pb hyperaccumulator, and translocation factor values (1.85), which are >1, indicate fit of L. stolonifera for eliminating Pb in Pb-contaminated water. Photosynthetic pigments were decreased with increase of Pb concentration and time exposure. Total chlorophyll content and Chl a/b ratio lowered to between 46 and 62% at 100 mg/L Pb after 10 days exposure.

A survey was administered to patients who had used a teleconsultation platform during the pandemic period. As one of the largest studies to date, a sample of 1233 respondents was collected and analyzed using a partial least squares approach, often mobilized in the information systems (IS) domain. Furthermore, a deep analysis using all recommended metrics was performed. The results highlight the significance of trusting beliefs, and self-efficacy in the adoption of digital healthcare services.

Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. Setting: The Louisiana Health Sciences Center - New Orleans Institutional Review Board and the University Medical Center Clinical Research Review Committee approved the study protocol. Data acquisition: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during March (March 1st through March 31st) 2020 at the University Medical Center New Orleans (UMCNO), who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same hospitalization. The EMR team generated a list of 257 patients admitted for COVID-19. We excluded seven patients because of a negative COVID-19 test result or incomplete medical record documentation. Three neurology residents (DC, MS, DB) reviewed the EMR in detail to capture the relevant medical history, clinical course, and laboratory test results and abstracted data into an electronic data collection spreadsheet.We recorded the presentation or development of the following neurological complaints: headache, syncope, altered mental status, seizure, status epilepticus, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Statistical analysis: We used \\"R\\" (statistics software) and Microsoft Excel to generate summary tables. To analyse hospital length of stay or death, we fitted a competing risks proportional hazards model for time to discharge or death using the crr() function in R version 4.0.0. The competing risks model allowed the analysis of hospital stay, taking into account that the censoring of cases due to death was not random. To predict the likelihood of intubation, we used the glm() function in R to fit a logistic regression model. For each model, we determined baseline demographic variables predictive of the outcomes and generated adjusted models.

Factors potentially influencing normal development of neurons and glial cells in the DG during its maturation can exert long-lasting effects on brain functions. Early life stress may modify maturation of the DG and induce lifelong alterations in its structure and functioning, underlying brain pathologies in adults. In this paper, maturation of neurons and glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) and the effects of early life events on maturation processes in the DG have been comprehensively reviewed. Early postnatal interventions affecting the DG eventually result in an altered number of granule neurons in the DG, ectopic location of neurons and changes in adult neurogenesis. Adverse events in early life provoke proinflammatory changes in hippocampal glia at cellular and molecular levels immediately after stress exposure. Later, the cellular changes may disappear, though alterations in gene expression pattern persist. Additional stressful events later in life contribute to manifestation of glial changes and behavioral deficits. Alterations in the maturation of neuronal and glial cells induced by early life stress are interdependent and influence the development of neural nets, thus predisposing the brain to the development of cognitive and psychiatric disorders.","output":"Early Life Events and Maturation of the Dentate Gyrus: Implications for Neurons and Glial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As SARS-CoV-2 spreads around the world, various hypotheses about factors involved in the spread of the virus are emerging, including the protective role of nicotine However, it has been known for decades that patients with chronic psychiatric conditions are much more likely to smoke It also appears that patients hospitalized in psychiatric institutions were, at the end of the lockdown period, much less affected by the coronavirus at the national level than professionals had feared An observationwas carried out in a unit dedicated to the care of infected patients in a hospital with psychiatric and follow-up care and rehabilitation activities, in a region severely impacted by the disease (?le-de-France): the nicotine theory is discussed and confirms the interest of including in research programs the examination of the specificities of patients under psychiatric care, as well as sustained attention to their somatic health condition Psychotropic treatments could play a role in the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 ? 2020 John Libbey Eurotext All rights reserved  mesure que le SARS-CoV-2 se propage au niveau mondial, diverses hypothses sur les facteurs de diffusion apparaissent parmi lesquelles le r?le protecteur de la nicotine Or, il est avr depuis des dcennies que les patients souffrant de pathologies psychiatriques chroniques sont beaucoup plus fumeurs que la moyenne Il appara?t galement que les patients hospitaliss en psychiatrie ont t, au terme de la priode de confinement, beaucoup moins atteints par le coronavirus au niveau national que ne le craignaient les professionnels Une observation est mene dans une unit ddie  la prise en charge de patients contamins au sein d'un h?pital ayant une activit psychiatrique et de SSR, dans une rgion fortement impacte (?le-de-France): la thorie nicotinique est discute et confirme l'intrt d'inclure au sein des programmes de recherche l'examen des spcificits des patients suivis en psychiatrie et une attention soutenue pour leur tat de sant somatique Les traitements psychotropes pourraient jouer un r?le dans le mode d'action du SARS-CoV-2 ? 2020 John Libbey Eurotext All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19 and the role of nicotine: Observations in hospital psychiatry and avenues of research on protective factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The purpose was to explore the experience, information and support needs, and decision-making of parents of children with congenital heart disease (CHD), as well as the children/young people themselves, during the COVID-19 crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey study of parents of children with CHD, children and young people, capturing experiences, decision-making, information, and support needs during the COVID-19 crisis was conducted. The survey launched for one month (April 9, 2020) during the first infection wave in the United Kingdom and subsequent restriction of free movement under lockdown rules from March 23, 2020, until May 31, 2020. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four parents and 36 children/young people completed the survey. Parents were more likely to worry about the virus (86.4%) than children/young people (69.4%), while (89%) parents were more vigilant for symptoms of the virus versus children/young people (69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight overarching themes: Virus-(1) risk of infection; (2)information, guidance, and advice; (3) change in health care provision; and (4) fears and anxieties, and lockdown and isolation-(5) psychological and social impact, (6) keeping safe under lockdown, (7) provisions and dependence on others, and (8) employment and income. CONCLUSIONS: There was widespread concern over the virus especially among parents.

The neurological complications in these patients vary based on patient age and underlying comorbidities. Data on clinical features, particularly neurological features, and prognostic factors in children and adolescents are limited. The present study provides a concise overview of neurological complications in pediatric COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study reviewed medical records of all patients who were admitted to our hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay between March 11, 2020 and January 30, 2021. Patients with a positive PCR result were categorized into two groups: Out Patient Departments (OPD) patients and In Patient Departments (IPD). RESULTS: Of the 2,530 children who underwent RT-PCR during the study period, 382 (8.6%) were confirmed as COVID-19 positive, comprising 188 (49.2%) girls and 194 (50.8%) boys with a mean age of 7.145.84 (range, 0-17) years. Neurological complications that required hospitalization were present in 34 (8.9%) patients, including seizure (52.9%), headache (38.2%), dizziness (11.1%) and meningoencephalitis (%5.8).

Here, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients up to 15 months after symptoms onset. Methods The levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies and neutralizing activities were tested in a total of 188 samples from 136 convalescent patients who experience mild to critical COVID-19. Specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in 76 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from 54 patients. Twenty-three vaccinated individuals were included for comparison. Findings Following a peak at day 15-28 post-infection, the IgG antibody response and plasma neutralizing titers gradually decreased over time but stabilized after 6 months. Plasma neutralizing activity against G614 was still detected in 87% of the patients at 6-15 months. Compared to G614, the median neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants in plasma collected at early (15-103 days) and late (9-15 month) convalescence were 16- and 8-fold lower, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cells reached a peak at 3-6 months and persisted in the majority of patients up to 15 months although a significant decrease in specific T cells was observed between 6 and 15 months. Conclusion The data suggest that antiviral specific immunity especially memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients is long-lasting, but some variants of concern, including the fast-spreading Delta variant, may at least partially escape the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies.

In this context, government of Bangladesh uses fixed staffing norms for its health facilities. These norms do not always reflect the actual requirement in reality. This study was conducted in public sector health facilities in two selected districts to assess the existing staffing norms with the purpose of adopting better norms and a more efficient utilization of the existing workforce. METHODS: To carry out this assessment, WHOs Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method was applied. Selection of the two districts out of 64 and a total of 24 health facilities were made in consultation with the formally established steering committee of the Ministry of Health. Health facilities, which were performing well in serving the patients during 2016C2017, were selected. This assessment examined staffing requirement of 20 staff categories. RESULTS: Based on the computer-generated WISN results, most of the staff categories were found to have a workload pressure of Very High (seven out of 20 staff categories), followed by Extremely High (five staff categories). Two staff categories had high, three had moderately high, two normal, and one low workload. Nurses were found to be predominantly occupied with support activities (50C60% of working time), instead of actual nursing care. Regarding vacancy, if all the vacant posts were filled, understandably, the workload would reduce, but not yet sufficient to meet the existing staff requirements such as consultants, general physicians and nurses at the district and sub-district/upazila-based hospitals. CONCLUSION: The existing staffing norms fall short of the WISN staffing requirement. The results provide evidence to prompt a revisit of the staffing policies and adopt workload-based norms. This can be supplemented by reviewing the scope of practice of the staff categories in their respective health facilities. In the short term, government might consider redistributing existing workforce as per workload.

To determine whether the intergenic sequence (IS) involved in sg mRNA synthesis could affect the transcription efficiencies of other ISs and in this way regulate transcription levels, we inserted multiple ISs at different positions into a mouse hepatitis virus defective interfering RNA. Quantitation of the sg RNAs produced by identical ISs in different sequence contexts led to the following conclusions: (i) transcription efficiency depends on the location of the IS in the defective interfering virus genome, (ii) downstream ISs have a negative effect on transcription levels from upstream ISs, and (iii) upstream ISs have little or no effect on downstream ISs. The observation that a downstream IS downregulates the amounts of sg RNA produced by an upstream IS explains why the smaller sg RNAs are, in general, produced in larger quantities than the larger sg RNAs. Our data are consistent with coronavirus transcription models in which ISs attenuate transcription. In these models, larger sg RNAs are synthesized in smaller amounts because they encounter more attenuating ISs during their synthesis.","output":"Regulation of coronavirus mRNA transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In this moments, of extreme gravity in which we find ourselves, and in the uncertainty face about the most effective treatment against COVID-19 disease and with the aim of find the evidence that support the chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine use recommendation to treat COVID-19 disease, a systematic review of published studies and RCT studies publishes until April 28, 2020 was carried out.

Chitin is a major component of the cuticle and it is synthesized by the enzyme chitin synthase. There is a single chitin synthase gene (kkv) in Drosophila facilitating research on the function of chitin. Previous editing of kkv lead to the recovery of a viable hypomorphic allele. Experiments described in this paper argue that a reduction in chitin synthase leads to the shafts of sensory bristles becoming fragile and frequently breaking off as the animals age. This is likely due to reduced chitin levels and further suggests that chitin plays a role in resilience of insect cuticle. The different layers in cuticle are continuous across the many epidermal cells that secrete the cuticle that covers the body. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this continuity. Using genetic mosaics and scanning electron microscopy this paper establishes that kkv shows short range cell non-autonomy. It also provides evidence for 2 possible mechanisms. One is the intercellular transfer of Kkv protein from one cell to its neighbors and the second is the deposition of cuticular material across the boundaries of neighboring cells.","output":"Short distance non-autonomy and intercellular transfer of chitin synthase in Drosophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CL protease) of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority drug target in the development of antivirals to combat COVID-19 infections.

In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drugs P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","output":"N-Terminal finger stabilizes the S1 pocket for the reversible feline drug GC376 in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes whether social distancing experienced by alternative demographic groups within the U.S. has been different amid COVID-19.

Human consciousness and decision-making capabilities are negatively influenced by manipulated, fabricated, biased or unverified news posts. Therefore, there is a high demand for designing veracity analysis systems to detect fake information contents in multiple data modalities. In an attempt to find a sophisticated solution to this critical issue, we proposed an architecture to consider both the textual and visual attributes of the data. After the data pre-processing is done, text and image features are extracted from the training data using separate deep learning models. Feature extraction from text is done using BERT and ALBERT language models that leverage the benefits of bidirectional training of transformers using a deep self-attention mechanism. The Inception-ResNet-v2 deep neural network model is employed for image data to perform the task. The proposed framework focused on two independent multi-modal fusion architectures of BERT and Inception-ResNet-v2 as well as ALBERT and Inception-ResNet-v2. Multi-modal fusion of textual and visual branches is extensively experimented and analysed using concatenation of feature vectors and weighted averaging of probabilities named as Early Fusion and Late Fusion respectively.

In Canada, a continuing opioid overdose crisis and overlapping challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic have generated urgency for scaling up community-based services that can meet the complex substance use and mental health needs of people leaving prison. In this commentary, we reflect on our experience with and knowledge gained by developing a national inventory of substance use and mental health services for criminal justice-involved persons who are re-entering the community. We learned that there is a scarcity of such community-based services specific to criminal justice-involved populations and a glaring lack of information about culturally safe and appropriate supports. Stakeholders from organisations across Canada identified that communities need a comprehensive array of low-barrier services, inclusive of harm reduction and substance use treatment services, to meet the diverse needs of people leaving prison. We recommend building greater investment in and awareness of community-driven, local programs, as well as enhancing efforts to engage people with lived and living experience in service design and provision.

We aimed at discussing the various neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to estimate the prevalence of each of them. METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WHO database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Relevant MeSH terms for COVID-19 and neurological manifestations were used. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports were included in the study. To estimate the overall proportion of each neurological manifestations, the study employed meta-analysis of proportions using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of each neurological manifestations are, smell disturbances (35.8%; 95% CI 21.4C50.2), taste disturbances (38.5%; 95%CI 24.0C53.0), myalgia (19.3%; 95% CI 15.1C23.6), headache (14.7%; 95% CI 10.4C18.9), dizziness (6.1%; 95% CI 3.1C9.2), and syncope (1.8%; 95% CI 0.9C4.6). Pooled prevalence of acute cerebrovascular disease was (2.3%; 95%CI 1.0C3.6), of which majority were ischaemic stroke (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9C3.3), followed by haemorrhagic stroke (0.4%; 95% CI 0.2C0.6), and cerebral venous thrombosis (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1C0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and from the large number of cases reported from all over the world daily, the prevalence of neurological features might increase again.

An incomplete microcirculatory reperfusion might contribute to these suboptimal clinical benefits. Objective: To investigate whether treatment with adjunct intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy improves outcomes following reperfusion. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from December 2018 through May 2021 in 7 stroke centers in Catalonia, Spain. The study included 121 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset and with an expanded Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia angiographic score of 2b50 to 3. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive intra-arterial alteplase (0.225 mg/kg; maximum dose, 22.5 mg) infused over 15 to 30 minutes (n = 61) or placebo (n = 52). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients achieving a score of 0 or 1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) in all patients treated as randomized. Safety outcomes included rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and death. Results: The study was terminated early for inability to maintain placebo availability and enrollment rate because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 1825 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy at the 7 study sites, 748 (41%) patients fulfilled the angiographic criteria, 121 (7%) patients were randomized (mean age, 70.6 [SD, 13.7] years; 57 women [47%]), and 113 (6%) were treated as randomized. The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 59.0% (36/61) with alteplase and 40.4% (21/52) with placebo (adjusted risk difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-36.4%; P = .047). The proportion of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours was 0% with alteplase and 3.8% with placebo (risk difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 2.5%). Ninety-day mortality was 8% with alteplase and 15% with placebo (risk difference, -7.2%; 95% CI, -19.2% to 4.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication.

By March 16, the NYC mayor and New York State Governor issued executive orders to postpone elective surgeries. At our tertiary care academic medical care center in the Bronx, the densely populated community of 1.4 million saw many COVID-19 positive cases. In response, the hospital quickly accommodated these patients, while maintaining outpatient orthopedic care. Consequently, only emergent orthopedic cases were granted permission to rapidly proceed to surgery. Most foot and ankle cases were deemed amenable to non-surgical or delayed surgical care. The purpose of this study is to characterize a series of patients with foot and ankle pathology whose orthopedic care was altered due to the pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review from February 2020-May 2020 encompassing the time that elective surgery was on hold and one month prior, to capture those patients were scheduled for surgery prior to the pandemic. Included were patients with foot and ankle pathology that required urgent orthopedic care, who were seen in the foot and ankle clinic, fracture clinic, and subsequently in the general orthopedic clinic that was instituted on an emergent bases. Excluded were patients who required intervention to address elective foot and ankle issues such as osteoarthritis, or ankle instability, and those were referred to an outside institution for further treatment. Throughout the pandemic, contact was made with patients either directly in clinic, via a telehealth portal or telephone. Descriptive statistics are taken. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients included in this series, 11 (65%) patients were managed non operatively. Of these, 4 chose nonoperative management due to shared decision making between the patient and surgeon. 2 patients could not have surgery due to complications related to COVID-19. As the zenith of the pandemic passed 2 patients remained fearful of infection and therefore chose non operative management. 3 patients that had been in contact with the orthopedic department refused further imaging. 6 patients were managed operatively. 2 patients had surgery during the peak of the pandemic, both of whom tested positive for COVID and who failed conservative management. 4 patients had delayed surgery. Of these four cases, 3 were malunion corrections that would have benefitted from more prompt surgery. CONCLUSION: There was an overall decrease in foot & ankle cases. Non- emergent foot and ankle surgery was delayed to divert resources to patients who were stricken with the COVID-19 virus. While every attempt was made to provide the appropriate care for all, a personalized approach to foot and ankle health was developed to address health concerns, preferences, and logistics. As the course of this global pandemic is still uncertain, it is imperative to have a strategy in place to deal with urgent cases, should a second wave of cases once again affect our ability to provide routine care.","output":"Changes to Foot and Ankle Surgical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for child abuse and neglect and commonly used reporting mechanisms were highly affected by SARS-Cov-2 pandemic; yet, little is known about the effects of SARS-Cov-2 on rates of child abuse and neglect. OBJECTIVE: To compare overall rates, demographics, types of abuse and acuity of child abuse and neglect encounters seen at one university health system for the 6 months before and after school closings due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data was extracted from a database of billed ICD10 codes for child abuse and neglect including sexual abuse codes. There were 579 encounters for patients <18 years of age and 476 unique patients. METHODS: In addition to ICD10 code and pre/post school closing, each encounter was identified to be inpatient, outpatient and/or emergency department. Demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race were extracted. Incident rate ratios in addition to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t-test, or the chi-square test of association were used in the analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified for total rates of child abuse and neglect encounters (p = .08), physical abuse (p = .91) nor child maltreatment (p = .86) codes or in the age (p = .46), gender (p = .58), and race/ethnicity (p = .15) of patient encounters pre- versus post-school closings.

This study explored the factors that influence uptake of malaria prevention strategies among pregnant women and children under-five years and the impact of COVID-19 in a malaria endemic rural district in Uganda. METHODS: This was a qualitative case study that used focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews involving pregnant women, caregivers of children under-five years, traditional birth attendants, village health teams, local leaders, and healthcare providers to explore malaria prevention uptake among pregnant women and children under-five years. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and data were analyzed using thematic content approach. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were enrolled in the Focus Group Discussions, 12 in the in-depth interviews, and 2 as key informants. Pregnant women and caregivers of children under-five years were able to recognize causes of malaria, transmission, and symptoms. All participants viewed malaria prevention as a high priority, and the use of insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets (ITNs) was upheld. Participants' own experiences indicated adverse effects of malaria to both pregnant women and children under-five. Home medication and the use of local herbs were a common practice. Some participants didnt use any of the malaria prevention methods due to deliberate refusal, perceived negative effects of the ITNs, and family disparity. The Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) control measures did not abate the risk of malaria infection but these were deleterious to healthcare access and the focus of malaria prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnant women and caregivers of children under-five years recognized symptoms of malaria infection, healthcare-seeking was not apt as some respondents used alternative approaches and delayed seeking formal healthcare. It is imperative to focus on the promotion of malaria prevention strategies and address drawbacks associated with misconceptions about these interventions, and promotion of health-seeking behaviors. As COVID-19 exacerbated the effect of malaria prevention uptake and healthcare seeking, its critical to recommit and integrate COVID-19 prevention measures in normative living and restrict future barriers to healthcare access.

METHODS: The prospective database of the Division of Thyroid Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China was used for this study. Covid19 emergency levels were stratified according to the World Health Organization: phase I (January 25CFebruary 25, 2020), phase II (February 26CMarch 19), phase III (March 20CApril 20). RESULTS: There were fewer outpatient FNAs and surgeries in 2020 than in 2019. There were no thyroid surgeries during phase I. There were also fewer surgeries for cancer with a significant reduction of advanced stage cancer treatments, mainly stage T1b N1a in phase II and T3bN1b in phase III. Operative times and postoperative stays were significantly shorter during the pandemic compared to our institutional baseline. In phase III, vocal cord paralysis (VCP) increased to 4.3% of our baseline numbers (P = 0.001). There were no cases of Covid19-related complications during the perioperative period. No patients required re-admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION: The Covid19 outbreak reduced thyroid surgery patient volumes. The decrease of Covid19 emergency plans contributed to unexpected outcomes (reduction of early stage cancer treatment, decreased operative times and hospital stays, increased VCP rate).

In order to understand how social needs unmet during maturation shape everyday life, we examined social motivation and cognition in peripubertal rats, as a rodent model of adolescence, subjected to social isolation (SI) during early and early-to-mid adolescence. The behavioral correlates of social orientation (social space preference), sociability (preference for social over non-social novelty), and social novelty preference (SNP) were examined in group-housed (GH) and single-housed (SH) rats in a 3-chamber test. The response to social odors was examined to gain insights into the developmental role of social odors in motivated social behavior. Differentiation between appetitive (number of visits/approaches) and consummatory (exploratory time) aspects of motivated social behavior was done to determine which facet of social motivation characterizes maturation when social needs are met and which aspect dominates when social needs are unsatisfied. The SI-sensitive parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVI) in the hippocampus were examined using immunohistochemistry. The main findings are the following: (1) in GH rats, the preference for social space is not evident regardless of animals age, while sociability becomes apparent in mid-adolescence strictly through consummatory behavior, along with complete SNP (appetitive, consummatory); (2) SH promotes staying in a social chamber/space regardless of animals age and produces an appetitive preference for it only in early-adolescent animals; (3) SH promotes sociability (appetitive, consummatory) regardless of the animals age and prevents the SNP; (4) the preference for a social odor is displayed in all the groups through consummatory behavior, while appetitive behavior is evident only in SH rats; (5) the response to social odors does not commensurate directly to the response to conspecifics; (6) SH does not influence PVI in the hippocampus, except in the case of early-adolescence when a transient decrease in the dentate gyrus is observed. These results accentuate the developmental complexity of social motivation and cognition, and the power of SI in adolescence to infringe social maturation at different functional levels, promoting appetitive behavior toward peers overall but harming the interest for social novelty.

The total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis (TFST) were inactive on the complement system but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria in vitro. In order to discover the metabolic activation of TFST by intestinal flora, the constituents of TFST and its metabolites were identified by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. Their anticomplement activities were evaluated through the classical and alternative pathway. As a result, eighteen flavonoids were identified, including seven flavonoid glycosides, five aglycones and six isoprenylated flavonoids. All the glycosides (daidzein-4-glucoside-rhamnoside, sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin) were metabolized into their corresponding aglycones in different extent by human intestinal bacteria, resulting in the contents of the five aglycones were highly increased in 24 h. However, no changes have occurred on the six isoprenylated flavonoids. Interestingly, three aglycones (quercetin, formononetin and maackiain) had significantly more potent anticomplement activities than their prototype glycosides. The results indicated that the enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity was attributed to the active aglycones, especially formononetin and quercetin, produced by human intestinal bacteria.

Agriculture of the Republic of Bashkortostan is one of the leading in the Russian Federation with 3.4%. For the main types of food: milk, meat, potatoes, vegetable oil and sugar, the region is completely independent. Despite the situation with Covid, in 2020 the region increased its agricultural production by 5%. the average monthly wage of agricultural producers is about 30% less than the wages of workers in processing industries. In turn, the level of remuneration of workers in the agricultural sector is on average 56-58% of the average for the region, in food processing industries - about 79%. It is quite obvious that an insufficiently high level of attractiveness of work in the agro-industrial complex leads to an outflow of qualified personnel to other industries. But to 2025-2030 the Republic of Bashkortostan needs an increase in the production of vegetables - not less than 30%, fish - 77%, fruits, berries - in 3-4 times.","output":"Economics and Management of Agricultural Production in the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Context of the COVID Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing micronutrient deficiencies, even if only a single micronutrient, can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infectious disease. Certain population groups are more likely to have micronutrient deficiencies, while certain disease pathologies and treatment practices also exacerbate risk, meaning these groups tend to suffer increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Optimisation of overall nutritional status, including micronutrients, can be effective in reducing incidence of infectious disease. Micronutrient deficiencies are rarely recognised but are prevalent in the UK, as well as much more widely, particularly in high-risk groups susceptible to COVID-19. Practitioners should be aware of this fact and should make it a consideration for the screening process in COVID-19, or when screening may be difficult or impractical, to ensure blanket treatment as per the best practice guidelines. Correction of established micronutrient deficiencies, or in some cases assumed suboptimal status, has the potential to help support immune function and mitigate risk of infection. The effects of and immune response to COVID-19 share common characteristics with more well-characterised severe acute respiratory infections. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies has proven effective in several infectious diseases and has been shown to promote favourable clinical outcomes. Micronutrients appear to play key roles in mediating the inflammatory response and such effects may be enhanced through correction of deficiencies. Many of those at highest risk during the COVID-19 pandemic are also populations at highest risk of micronutrient deficiencies and poorer overall nutrition. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies in established COVID-19 infection may contribute to supporting immune response to infection in those at highest risk.

Random sequences have plausible and complex predicted structures not easily distinguishable from those of structural RNAs. How to tell when an RNA has a conserved structure is a question that requires looking at the evolutionary signature left by the conserved RNA. This question is important not just for long noncoding RNAs which usually lack an identified function, but also for RNA binding protein motifs which can be single stranded RNAs or structures. Here we review recent advances using sequence and structural analysis to determine when RNA structure is conserved or not. Although covariation measures assess structural RNA conservation, one must distinguish covariation due to RNA structure from covariation due to independent phylogenetic substitutions. We review a statistical test to measure false positives expected under the null hypothesis of phylogenetic covariation alone (specificity). We also review a complementary test that measures power, that is, expected covariation derived from sequence variation alone (sensitivity). Power in the absence of covariation signals the absence of a conserved RNA structure. We analyze artifacts that falsely identify conserved RNA structure such as the misuse of programs that do not assess significance, the use of inappropriate statistics confounded by signals other than covariation, or misalignments that induce spurious covariation. Among artifacts that obscure the signal of a conserved RNA structure, we discuss the inclusion of pseudogenes in alignments which increase power but destroy covariation.

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical validity of the Hand CAC 30 in enterocolic side-to-side anastomosis after colonic or enteric resections. METHODS A non-randomized prospective data collection was performed for patients undergoing a side-to-side anastomosis using the Hand CAC 30. Eligibility criteria for the use of the Hand CAC 30 were for anastomoses between the colon and the ileum or between two small bowels. The primary short-term endpoint was the rate of anastomotic leakage. Other clinical outcomes, including intra- and postoperative complications, length of operation time and hospital stay, and the clip elimination time were recorded. RESULTS A total of 63 patients (male, 36) underwent an enteric or right-sided colonic resection followed by a side-to-side anastomosis using the Hand CAC 30. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 36 patients, in whom one patient who underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was converted to an open procedure (1/32, 3.1%). One patient with ascending colon cancer showed postoperative anastomotic leakage and died of co-morbid ischemic heart disease. There were no other surgical mortalities. The exact date of expulsion of the clip could not be recorded because most patients were not aware of clip elimination. No patients manifested clinical symptoms of anastomotic stricture.

We found that 2-doses of self-amplifying RNA vaccine based on the ancestral spike ameliorated weight loss following Delta infection and decreased viral loads, but had minimal effect on Omicron/BA.1 infection. Prior infection with ancestral or Alpha variant was partially protective against Omicron/BA.1 infection, whereas all animals previously infected with Delta and exposed to Omicron became infected, although shed less virus. We further tested whether prior infection with Omicron/BA.1 protected from re-infection with Delta or Omicron/BA.2. Omicron/BA.1 was protective against Omicron/BA.2, but not Delta reinfection, again showing Delta and Omicron have a very large antigenic distance. Indeed, cross-neutralisation assays with human antisera from otherwise immunona?ve individuals (unvaccinated and no known prior infection), confirmed a large antigenic distance between Delta and Omicron. Prior vaccination followed by Omicron or Delta breakthrough infection led to a higher degree of cross-reactivity to all tested variants. To conclude, cohorts whose only immune experience of COVID is Omicron/BA.1 infection may be particularly vulnerable to future circulation of Delta or Delta-like derivatives.

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of acquiring infection after COVID-19 exposure, we evaluated the effectiveness of a contact tracing assessment to identify the high-risk contacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All HCW who tested COVID-19 positive in July 2020 were interviewed to do risk assessment based on their exposure, advised quarantine, and then followed up on day 14 for development of symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Contact tracing identified 2569 HCW contacts for 422 index positive cases, among which 1642 (63.9%) were contactable for follow-up. Among 1642 contacts, 12.97% developed COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of the exposure. Household contacts comprising (142 out of 956, 14.9%) had a higher risk of becoming symptomatic than workplace contacts (71 out of 686, 10.3%) ([odds ratio 0.66 (confidence interval 0.49C0.89)]. Of these, 76.6% of the household exposure and 55.4% of significant workplace exposure were tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the risk assessment, we found that a HCW is likely to acquire infection at home rather than at the workplace, and hence, an appropriate quarantine policy can help decrease the transmission and mitigate staff shortage.","output":"Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 and Utility of Contact Tracing in Risk Assessment of Health-Care Worker Exposure during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Owing to infrastructural and population characteristics, the prison setting is at increased risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for severe clinical outcomes. Because of structural and operational reasons, research in prison settings is challenging and available studies are often monocentric and have limited temporal coverage; broader-based research is necessary. OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic within the prison system of a large Italian region, Lombardy, and report the infection prevention and control measures implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This repeated cross-sectional study was carried out from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021 (first wave, March-June 2020; second wave, October 2020-February 2021) in the prison system of Lombardy, which includes 18 detention facilities for adults. All incarcerated persons and the prison staff of the penitentiary system of the Lombardy region participated in the study. EXPOSURES: The main exposures of interest were the weekly average number of incarcerated individuals placed in quarantine in single or shared isolation rooms, the rate of sick leave by symptomatic and asymptomatic prison staff reported to the prison occupational medicine department on a weekly basis, and the level of overcrowding. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were weekly COVID-19 crude case rates, weekly test positivity rate, and the relative risk of acquiring the infection for prison staff, incarcerated persons, and the general population. RESULTS: The study population comprised a mean of 7599 incarcerated individuals and 4591 prison staff. Approximately 5.1% of the prison population were women; demographic characteristics of the prison staff were not available. During the study, COVID-19 occurred in 1564 incarcerated individuals and 661 prison staff. Most of these cases were reported during the second wave (1474 in incarcerated individuals, 529 in prison staff), when stringent measures previously enforced were relaxed. During both epidemic waves, incarcerated individuals and prison staff had a higher relative risk for COVID-19 infection than the general population during both the first wave (incarcerated individuals: 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.58; prison staff: 3.23; 95% CI, 2.74-3.84) and the second wave (incarcerated individuals: 3.91; 95% CI, 3.73-4.09; prison staff: 2.61; 95% CI, 2.41-2.82). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that the prison setting was an element of fragility during COVID-19 pandemic, with a high burden of COVID-19 cases among both the incarcerated individuals and prison staff. The prison setting and prison population need to be included and possibly prioritized in the response during epidemic events.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Among Incarcerated Individuals and Prison Staff in Lombardy, Italy, March 2020 to February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The risk factors that emerge with the onset and protraction of humanitarian crises leave populations at a heightened risk of excess morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). There is currently little clarity on which vaccines are being used in crises throughout the world, and whether vaccination decisions correspond to local disease threats. This review aimed to collect and analyse such information. METHODS: We reviewed vaccination services from January 2015 to June 2019 across all 25 humanitarian responses that had an activated coordination mechanism during this period. A range of online sources and informants within the humanitarian sector were consulted to compile data on which vaccines were provided in each crisis, and the modality and timing of vaccine provision. The package of vaccination services since the start of each crisis was then compared with local disease burden (baselinea?+a?excess due to crisis-emergent risk factors). RESULTS: The range of vaccines used in humanitarian crises appears limited. When offered, vaccines were primarily delivered through the pre-existing routine schedule, with few supplementary actions taken in recognition of the need for rapidly enhancing population immunity. Vaccine packages mostly did not address the actual range of VPDs that likely accounted for substantial disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests inconsistencies and inequities in vaccine provision to crisis-affected populations. A consistent, standardised and broader approach to vaccine use in crises is needed.","output":"The utilisation of vaccines in humanitarian crises, 2015-2019: A review of practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency (VDD) are widely recognized as risk factors for respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D influences expression of many genes with well-established relevance to airway infections and relevant to immune system function. Recently, VDD has been shown to be a risk factor for acquisition and severity of COVID-19. Thus, treating VDD presents a safe and inexpensive opportunity for modulating the severity of the disease. VDD is common in those over 60 years of age, many with co-morbid conditions and in people with skin pigmentation sufficient to reduce synthesis of vitamin D. Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is also associated with worse outcomes from COVID19. Vitamin D stimulates transcription of cathelicidin which is cleaved to generate LL37. LL37 is an innate antimicrobial with demonstrated activity against a wide range of microbes including envelope viruses. LL37 also modulates cytokine signaling at the site of infections. Fine particles in air pollution can interfere with LL37 destruction of viruses and may reduce effective immune signaling modulation by LL37. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37. Conclusion: Vitamin D plays an important role reducing the impact of viral lung disease processes. VDD is an acknowledged public health threat that warrants population-wide action to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37.

To date, little is known about suicide among hospitality workers in Australia. METHODS: Suicide data were obtained from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Occupational suicide rates were calculated using the Australian Bureau of Statistics population-level data from the 2011 census. Negative binomial regression, univariate logistic regression, and multivariate logistic regression were used to estimate the association between suicide and employment as a hospitality worker over the period 2006C2017, compared to all other occupations. RESULTS: Suicide rates for chefs was significantly higher than for persons in non-hospitality occupations [incidence rate ratio (IRR), 3.93; 95% CI 2.53C5.79; P < 0.001]. The interaction between occupation and sex was examined with follow-up testing. Suicide rates for female chefs were significantly higher than for females in non-hospitality occupations (IRR, 3.93; 95% CI 2.60C5.94). Suicide rates for male chefs were also significantly higher than males in non-hospitality occupations (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI 1.14C1.67). Compared with non-hospitality occupations, hospitality workers who died by suicide had significantly greater odds of being female (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50C0.79), residing in residential Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) classified as most disadvantaged (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19C2.20), and being born outside of Australia (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.34C2.25).

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm  1.99 and 0.94  0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1%  0.115 and 98.5%  0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3%  0.110 and 96.1%  0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8%  0.09 and 14%  0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.","output":"AAR-LN-DQ: Automatic Anatomy Recognition based Disease Quantification in Thoracic Lymph Node Zones via FDG PET/CT images without Nodal Delineation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past year has been one of unprecedented challenge for the modern world and especially the medical profession.

Ad12 replicates in human cells but undergoes a completely abortive cycle in Syrian hamster cells. Ad12 induces neuro-ectodermal tumors in newborn hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Each tumor cell or Ad12-transformed hamster cell carries multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA. Ad12 DNA usually integrates at one chromosomal site which is not specific since Ad12 DNA can integrate at many different locations in the hamster genome. Epigenetic research occupies a prominent role in tumor biology. We have been using the human Ad12 Syrian hamster cell system for the analysis of epigenetic alterations in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumors. Virion or free intracellular Ad12 DNA remains unmethylated at CpG sites, whereas the integrated viral genomes become de novo methylated in specific patterns. Inverse correlations between promoter methylation and activity were described for the first time in this system and initiated active research in the field of DNA methylation and epigenetics. Today, promoter methylation has been recognized as an important factor in long-term genome silencing. We have also discovered that the insertion of foreign (Ad12, bacteriophage lambda, plasmid) DNA into mammalian genomes can lead to genome-wide alterations in methylation and transcription patterns in the recipient genomes. This concept has been verified recently in a pilot study with human cells which had been rendered transgenomic for a 5.6 kbp bacterial plasmid. Currently, we study epigenetic effects on cellular methylation and transcription patterns in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells. These epigenetic alterations are considered crucial elements in (viral) oncogenesis.","output":"Discoveries in Molecular Genetics with the Adenovirus 12 System: Integration of Viral DNA and Epigenetic Consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION viral bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Environmental and genetic factors can favour respiratory tract infections. AIM to analyse risk factors for bronchiolitis and to investigate the predisposing factors for developing transient wheezing and asthma through 6-year follow-up after hospitalization for bronchiolitis compared with a group of healthy controls that belonged to Piccolipi cohort, who never had bronchiolitis. METHODS we enrolled 645 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and clinical data. At 6 years of age, 370 cases and 183 controls were investigated for the presence of asthma by structured questionnaire, for prick test and for spirometry and classified in asthmatic, transient wheezing, no wheezing/no asthma. RESULTS breastfeeding was an independent protective factor (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.4, p<0.001) and tobacco smoke was a risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.1, p<0.001). Analysing follow-up, bronchiolitis increased the risk of developing transient wheezing by 12.9 (95%IC: 6.3-26.1, p<0.001) and of developing asthma by 4.6 (95%IC: 1.9-10.7, p<0.001). A positive family history of atopy increased the risk of developing asthma by 3.1 (95%IC 1.4-6.7, p=0.005). Asthmatic patients had a lower % FEV1, a lower % FVC and a lower FEV1/FVC values and they had more frequently positive skin prick test. CONCLUSION bronchiolitis is influenced by environmental factors: tobacco smoke increases its risk and breastfeeding is a protective factor. At the end of 6 years of follow-up, bronchiolitis is a significant risk factor to have pre-school wheezing and asthma. This article is protected by copyright.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) was one of the many areas negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A high number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients had their centre-based program suspended. Physical activity (PA) recommendations for CVD patients are well established and its benefits largely documented. However, few studies have objectively measured the PA of these patients throughout the years and specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: To objectively measure PA and sedentary time (ST) during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the previous 2 years in CVD patients who were attending a phase III centre-based CR program. METHODS: Before COVID-19, eighty-seven CVD patients (mean age 62.9  9.1, 82.8% male) were attending a face-to-face long-term CR program. Of the 87 patients, 78.2% have been on the program for at least 1 year. Every year, PA and ST were objectively assessed by accelerometery. After the CR centre-based program suspension due to COVID-19, efforts were done to create a CR home-based digital model to maintain the continuum of care and avoid losing the previous acquired benefits. After 7 months of suspension, the face-to-face CR centre was reopened and 57.5% (n = 50) patients returned. We completed the assessment of PA and ST of 37 patients (mean age 64.8  8.1, 89.2% male) and compared it as follows: M1) two assessments before COVID-19; M2) last assessment before COVID-19; M3) 7 months after CR program suspension (last trimester of 2020). Patients wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 consecutive days to assess daily and weekly minutes of light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA and ST. We used repeated-measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed rank as a non-parametric alternative. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that in M3 patients decreased their average daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA when compared with M2 (M3: 37.90  3.30 min/day vs M2: 45.01  3.14 min/day, p = 0.035), no changes were found between M1 and M2. Average daily time spent in light PA improved significantly from M1 to M2 (M1: 154.81  7.20 min/day vs M2: 169.17  6.44 min/day, p = 0.042) but did not change from M2 to M3. Despite this, in M3, 81.08% of the patients still met the recommendations for moderate-to-vigorous PA (M1: 89.19% and M2: 91.89%). No changes were found in ST. CONCLUSION: Despite a significant decrease on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA during the COVID-19 era, most CVD patients, first in the centre-based CR program and after in the home-based CR program, were able to meet PA recommendations throughout the last years. These findings suggest that CVD patients who attend supervised long-term CR programs might be aware of the importance of reaching PA guidelines. Reducing ST by replacing it by PA of any intensity could be an important and reachable target for long-term CR programs.","output":"COVID-19 era in long-term cardiac rehabilitation programs: how did physical activity and sedentary time change compared to previous years?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose using a pre-trained segmentation model to perform diagnostic classification in order to achieve better generalization and interpretability, terming the technique reverse-transfer learning.

How they impact cystic fibrosis lung disease history in young children is poorly known. The principal aim of our study was to determinate respiratory tract infections frequency in this cystic fibrosis young population. Secondary outcomes were nature of viral agents recovered and impact of such infections. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 25 children affected by cystic fibrosis and aged less than 2 years. Nasal samplings were taken systematically monthly or bimonthly with additional samples taken during respiratory tract infections episodes. Ten pathogens were tested by a combination of five duplex RT-PCRs or PCRs: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV)), coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), parainfluenza virus (1C4), adenovirus and bocavirus (Respiratory Multi-Well System MWS r-gene?, BioMrieux, Marcy ltoile, France). Cycle thresholds (CTs) were reported for all positive samples and considered positive for values below 40. Quantitative variables were compared using a nonparametric statistical test (Wilcoxon signed rank for paired comparisons). Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess relationships between two variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or GraphPad Prism V6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The significance level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age at inclusion was 9.6  6.7 months. The patients had 3.4  1.7 respiratory tract infections episodes per child per year.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the published studies to assess the association of RAS inhibitors with mortality as well as disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve relevant original studies investigating mortality and severity (severe/critical disease) in COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to RAS inhibitors. RESULTS: A total of 59 original studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Twenty-four studies that reported adjusted effect sizes (24 studies reported mortality outcomes and 16 studies reported disease severity outcomes), conducted in RAS inhibitorCexposed and unexposed groups, were pooled in random-effects models to estimate overall risk. Quality assessment of studies revealed that most of the studies included were of fair quality. The use of an ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with lower odds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56C0.95; n = 18,749) or hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60C0.95; n = 26,598) of mortality compared with non-use of ACEI/ARB.

Possible factors for a long time from first symptom to diagnosis (the total interval) include patient, tumour and healthcare characteristics, but until now the most relevant risk factors and its association with outcomes remain unknown. Our study aims to (1) quantify total interval, the time interval from first symptom until (histological) diagnosis; (2) identify factors associated with interval length and (3) determine the association between total interval and HRQoL, stage and tumour size at diagnosis, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a longitudinal, prospective, international, multicentre cohort study among patients aged &#8805;18 years with newly diagnosed bone or soft tissue sarcoma at eight centres (three in UK, five in The Netherlands).

METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study examined data from JMDC Inc., an administrative claims database. Patients with HbA1c value of at least 6.5% at routine annual check, aged 20 years or older, and prescribed at least one antidiabetic drug were included. This cohort was classified into early physician visit and delayed physician visit groups based on the timing of the first physician visit relative to the median. Patients were monitored from the date of first HbA1c checkup of at least 6.5% to the date of first physician visit with an HbA1c test, and from the date of the first physician visit to the date of prescription of first-line and second-line T2DM treatments.

Significant steric conditions must be met by enzymes, being that to adapt their configurations is mandatory for hVKORC1 activation. We studied, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the folding and conformational plasticity of hVKORC1 in its inactive (fully oxidised) state using available structures, crystallographic and from de novo modelling. According to the obtained results, hVKORC1 is a modular protein composed of the stable transmembrane domain (TMD) and intrinsically disordered luminal (L) loop, possessing the great plasticity/adaptability required to perform various steps of the activation process. The docking (HADDOCK) of Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) onto different hVKORC1 conformations clearly indicated that the most interpretable solutions were found on the target closed L-loop form, a prevalent conformation of hVKORC1s oxidised state. We also suggest that the cleaved L-loop is an appropriate entity to study hVKORC1 recognition/activation by its redox protein. Additionally, the application of hVKORC1 (membrane protein) in aqueous solution is likely to prove to be very useful in practice in either in silico studies or in vitro experiments.","output":"Human Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase as a Target of Its Redox Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are in the midst of a global pandemic, the COVID-19.

Organizational resilience (OReg) and emotional intelligence (EI) discretely have been identified as indicators of employee performance (EP) over the years, but during the period of crisis, it has scarcely been analysed. Therefore, this study aims to examine the mediating role of EI on the relationship between OReg and EP in such a global pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 390 samples including teaching and non-teaching professionals working in higher educational institutions (HEIs) were collected from different HEIs located in India through online survey questionnaires. The collected data was further analysed using regression analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modelling along with bootstrapping technique, reliability and validity analysis, mediation analysis and model fit indices analysis. Findings: The results of the study confirmed the partial mediation effect of EI on the OReg-EP relationship, and further results also exhibited that employees with a higher level of EI, contribute more positively to the OReg level, which further enhances the performance level at the workplace. Research limitations/implications: The samples collected for the current study pertain to the HEIs only, and therefore the present study results have limited general applicability. Furthermore, the study does not investigate the influence of time. Practical implications: This study would assist practitioners of HEIs in improving the resilience capabilities of the organization. EP can be improved by enhancing the levels of OReg and individual emotional intelligence, which is in line with the findings of the current study. Social implications: In the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide the students are affected due to the transition to online teaching. This study will help HEIs to cope up with the students loss by being flexible in approach for the retention of performance of employees by taking care of their emotional needs and focusing on their skill development by providing a learning culture in a depressing time of the pandemic so that students will not suffer due to this rapid change without any preparation or previous experience in a pandemic.

The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) measures the positive aspects of mental health. Previous studies confirmed its construct validity, reliability, and unidimensionality with confirmatory factor analysis. Four studies have performed a Rasch analysis on the WEMWBS, but none of them tested adults in the US. The goals of our study are to use Rasch analysis to validate the WEMWBS in the general US population and in adults with stroke. Methods: We recruited community-dwelling adults and adults with chronic stroke with upper limb hemiplegia or hemiparesis. We used the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model (RUMM) 2030 software to evaluate item and person fit, targeting, person separation reliability (PSR), and differential item functioning (DIF) for sample sizes of at least 200 persons in each subgroup. Results: After deleting two items, the WEMBS analyzed in our 553 community-dwelling adults (average age 51.22 +/- 17.18 years; 358 women) showed an excellent PSR=0.91 as well as person and item fit, but the items are too easy for this population (person mean location=2.17 +/- 2.00). There was no DIF for sex, mental health, or practicing breathing exercises. In the 37 adults with chronic stroke (average age 58 +/- 13; 11 women) the WEMWBS had a good item and person fit, and PSR=0.92, but the items were too easy for this group as well (person mean location=3.13 +/- 2.00). Conclusions: The WEMWBS had good item and person fit but the targeting is off when used in community-dwelling adults and adults with stroke in the US. Adding more difficult items might improve the targeting and capture a broader range of positive mental wellbeing in both populations.

METHODS In a randomized, double-blind study, effects of clonidine (150 microg orally), midazolam (7.5 mg orally) and placebo administered 60-90 min prior to estimated anaesthesia induction time were investigated in 60 healthy ASA I or II patients. All patients received dipotassiumchlorazepate the evening before surgery. At predefined time points, effects of premedication on bispectral index, sedation score and visual analogue scales for anxiety and pain, cognitive function and stress hormones were determined. RESULTS Administration of low-dose clonidine was associated with slightly lower bispectral index scores than a standard dose of midazolam or placebo. There were no significant differences in sedation score, visual analogue scale for anxiety and pain and cognitive function between treatment regimens. Clonidine, but not midazolam, reduced anaesthetic requirements for induction of anaesthesia and prevented an increase in heart rate as well as an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels during the preoperative period (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Clonidine administration did not delay postoperative recovery. CONCLUSION Clonidine augmented haemodynamic stability and partially blunted stress responses as determined by adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels. In addition, clonidine did not delay postoperative recovery. Therefore, surrogate parameters indicate that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine may be superior to midazolam in healthy individuals.

Many cancer providers and support services are committed to providing high quality care, yet struggle with providing accessible, culturally safe cancer care to Indigenous Australians. Two Australian cancer services, one urban and one regional, were identified as particularly focused on providing culturally safe cancer care for Indigenous cancer patients and their families. The article explores the experiences of Indigenous cancer patients and their families within the cancer services and ascertains how their experiences of care matches with the cancer services strategies to improve care. METHODS: Services were identified as part of a national study designed to identify and assess innovative services for Indigenous cancer patients and their families. Case studies were conducted with a small number of identified services. In-depth interviews were conducted with Indigenous people affected by cancer and hospital staff. The interviews from two services, which stood out as particularly high performing, were analysed through the lens of the patient experience. RESULTS: Eight Indigenous people affected by cancer and 23 hospital staff (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) were interviewed. Three experiences were shared by the majority of Indigenous cancer patients and family members interviewed in this study: a positive experience while receiving treatment at the cancer service; a challenging time between receiving diagnosis and reaching the cancer centre; and the importance of family support, while acknowledging the burden on family and carers. CONCLUSIONS: This article is significant because it demonstrates that with a culturally appropriate and person-centred approach, involving patients, family members, Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff, it is possible for Indigenous people to have positive experiences of cancer care in mainstream, tertiary health services. If we are to improve health outcomes for Indigenous people it is vital more cancer services and hospitals follow the lead of these two services and make a sustained and ongoing commitment to strengthening the cultural safety of their service.

Examining the psychosocial variables that may lead to greater adoption of such precautionary behaviors is critical. The present study examines predictors of precautionary practices against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 709 Mexican participants from 24 states. The study was conducted via online questionnaire between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, when the pandemic response was in its initial stages in Mexico. The instrument included demographic items, as well as scales assessing COVID-19-resembling symptoms, empathy, impulsivity, anhedonic depression, general health practices, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-associated precautionary behaviors. Most participants reported adopting limited social distancing or other precautionary behaviors against COVID-19. The results of a structural equation model demonstrated that the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was related to impulsivity and general health behaviors. However, no direct association between precautionary behaviors and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was found. In turn, precautionary behaviors were more prevalent among participants who reported higher empathy and general health behaviors and were inhibited indirectly by impulsivity via alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the model suggests that anhedonic depression symptoms have a negative indirect effect on precautionary behaviors via general health behaviors. Finally, impulsivity showed a negative direct effect on general health behavior. These results highlight the role that general physical health and mental health play on precautionary behavior and the critical importance of addressing issues such as depression, general health behaviors, and impulsivity in promoting safe actions and the protection of self and others.","output":"Psychological Predictors of Precautionary Behaviors in Response to COVID-19: A Structural Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic of Yunnan province, and we provide targeted prevention and control advice","output":"Spatial analysis of COVID-19 epidemic situation of Yunnan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Narnaviruses are RNA viruses detected in diverse fungi, plants, protists, arthropods, and nematodes. Though initially described as simple single-gene nonsegmented viruses encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a subset of narnaviruses referred to as ambigrammatic harbor a unique genomic configuration consisting of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoded on opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis supports selection to maintain this unusual genome organization, but functional investigations are lacking. Here, we establish the mosquito-infecting Culex narnavirus 1 (CxNV1) as a model to investigate the functional role of overlapping ORFs in narnavirus replication. In CxNV1, a reverse ORF without homology to known proteins covers nearly the entire 3.2-kb segment encoding the RdRp. Additionally, two opposing and nearly completely overlapping novel ORFs are found on the second putative CxNV1 segment, the 0.8-kb Robin RNA. We developed a system to launch CxNV1 in a naive mosquito cell line and then showed that functional RdRp is required for persistence of both segments, and an intact reverse ORF is required on the RdRp segment for persistence. Mass spectrometry of persistently CxNV1-infected cells provided evidence for translation of this reverse ORF. Finally, ribosome profiling yielded a striking pattern of footprints for all four CxNV1 RNA strands that was distinct from actively translating ribosomes on host mRNA or coinfecting RNA viruses. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that the process of translation itself is important for persistence of ambigrammatic narnaviruses, potentially by protecting viral RNA with ribosomes, thus suggesting a heretofore undescribed viral tactic for replication and transmission. IMPORTANCE Fundamental to our understanding of RNA viruses is a description of which strand(s) of RNA are transmitted as the viral genome relative to which encode the viral proteins. Ambigrammatic narnaviruses break the mold. These viruses, found broadly in fungi, plants, and insects, have the unique feature of two overlapping genes encoded on opposite strands, comprising nearly the full length of the viral genome. Such extensive overlap is not seen in other RNA viruses and comes at the cost of reduced evolutionary flexibility in the sequence. The present study is motivated by investigating the benefits which balance that cost. We show for the first time a functional requirement for the ambigrammatic genome configuration in Culex narnavirus 1, which suggests a model for how translation of both strands might benefit this virus. Our work highlights a new blueprint for viral persistence, distinct from strategies defined by canonical definitions of the coding strand.","output":"Persistence of Ambigrammatic Narnaviruses Requires Translation of the Reverse Open Reading Frame"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actigraphy has been established as a reliable sleep assessment tool in adults; however, its utility in newborns remains unknown. Validation of actigraphy in newborns may provide a significant insight into the physiological and pathological acquisition process of mature diurnal sleep patterns and subsequent morbidities in both newborns and their mothers. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of sleep-wake detection by overnight actigraphy in a cohort of newborns. Simultaneous recording of polysomnography and actigraphy data was performed in 40 newborns admitted to a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A mixed-effects logistic regression model to explain the sleep state identified by polysomnography was employed using the actigraphic activity score as a fixed independent variable and the individual newborn's identity as a random effect. To evaluate the usefulness of the actigraphic activity score as a surrogate marker of sleep, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using the variables that were used in the mixed-effects logistic regression model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was assessed. The results showed that polysomnography-determined sleep epochs were associated with a smaller activity index on actigraphy (odds ratio per 10 activity indices increase 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.84). The AUC for the ROC curve was 0.87 (95% CI 0.87-0.88, range 0.54-0.99). An activity score of 124 showed the maximum overall accuracy (90.2%, 95% CI 87.7-92.1).

METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study during March 11C16, 2020, 750 individuals in Golestan Province of Iran were included in the study using the convenience sampling and they completed the questionnaires through cyberspace. Factor scores were calculated using the confirmatory factor analysis. The effects of different factors were separately investigated using the univariate analyses, including students sample t-test, ANOVA, and simple linear regression. Finally, the effective factors were examined by the multiple regression analysis at a significant level of 0.05 and through Mplus 7 and SPSS 16. RESULTS: The participants mean age was 33.9  9.45 years; and 57.1% of them had associate and bachelor's degrees.

Unfortunately, this method is expensive and may exclude useful (if uncertain) answers. Prior work introduced Uncertainty Annotated Databases (UA-DBs), which combine an under- and over-approximation of certain answers. UA-DBs combine the reliability of certain answers based on incomplete K-relations with the performance of classical deterministic database systems. However, UA-DBs only support a limited class of queries and do not support attribute-level uncertainty which can lead to inaccurate under-approximations of certain answers. In this paper, we introduce attribute-annotated uncertain databases (AU-DBs) which extend the UA-DB model with attribute-level annotations that record bounds on the values of an attribute across all possible worlds. This enables more precise approximations of incomplete databases. Furthermore, we extend UA-DBs to encode an compact over-approximation of possible answers which is necessary to support non-monotone queries including aggregation and set difference. We prove that query processing over AU-DBs preserves the bounds of certain and possible answers and investigate algorithms for compacting intermediate results to retain efficiency. Through an compact encoding of possible answers, our approach also provides a solid foundation for handling missing data. Using optimizations that trade accuracy for performance, our approach scales to complex queries and large datasets, and produces accurate results. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms alternative methods for uncertain data management.","output":"Efficient Uncertainty Tracking for Complex Queries with Attribute-level Bounds (extended version)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is mainly a disease of adults but can affect vulnerable children indirectly through social containment measures. The study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the lives of Quranic schoolboys, almudos, who beg on behalf of their teachers, chernos, in Guinea-Bissau. METHODS: Data were collected in July 2020 during a state of emergency. Data rest on semistructured interviews with 14 almudos and observations. The almudos, aged 12C16 years, were identified in the capital Bissau and the regional centre Gab. RESULTS: Four interconnected themes were found. The first, hardship, was brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and caused by lockdown and police threats, resulting in a decrease in alms and hunger. The second, circumvention of calamity, included preventive measures the boys undertook and concerns with crowdedness impeding social distancing. Relations with others is the third theme. These had changed with sharply reduced contacts with neighbours and other providers of alms. The parents had more frequent telephone contact with their sons, and encouraged them to continue their studies. At the same time, the chernos and almudos passed more time together, and they dedicated more time than earlier to the studies and prayers. The fourth theme has to do with the boys concerns about their long-term aspirationsto complete their studies and become respected chernos, for which begging was seen as an integral part. CONCLUSION: The almudos suffered from decreased alms, resulting in hunger. COVID-19 was only an additional burden to the boys, who are used to facing challenges while begging to complete their religious education.

These infectious respiratory disorders are divided into two groups: the diseases of upper respiratory tract, namely, nasal myiasis and enzootic nasal tumors, and diseases of lower respiratory tract, namely, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), parainfluenza, Pasteurellosis, Ovine progressive pneumonia, mycoplasmosis, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, caseous lymphadenitis, verminous pneumonia, and many others. Depending upon aetiology, many of them are acute and fatal in nature. Early, rapid, and specific diagnosis of such diseases holds great importance to reduce the losses. The advanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of antigen as well as antibodies directly from the samples and molecular diagnostic assays along with microsatellites comprehensively assist in diagnosis as well as treatment and epidemiological studies. The present review discusses the advancements made in the diagnosis of common infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats. It would update the knowledge and help in adapting and implementing appropriate, timely, and confirmatory diagnostic procedures. Moreover, it would assist in designing appropriate prevention protocols and devising suitable control strategies to overcome respiratory diseases and alleviate the economic losses.","output":"Advances in Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases of Small Ruminants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the current global public health threat with no specific, effective, and approved treatment available till date.

As per the latest WHO report, approximately 8.2 million people are infected, and nearly 0.44 million lives are lost to COVID. The infection has spread to over 200 countries and territories around the world. The world is in search of efficient diagnostics and therapeutics, including vaccines, biologics and drugs. With the rapid increase in rates of infection and time constraints, drug repurposing seems to be a potential and viable option to find the promising anti-COVID therapeutics. In the wake of a rapid increase in the number of clinical trials involving drugs for repurposing, we aim to provide information on the safety concerns related to the drugs currently investigated in trials. This review also highlights the possible mechanisms of actions, adverse drug reactions, and contraindications of the drugs under repurposing evaluation.","output":"Repurposing of FDA Approved Drugs as COVID-19 Therapeutics: Safety Concerns and Contraindications of Drugs in Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 2020, it is known that Indonesia has experienced the impact of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Pandemic, and making health workers at the forefront of potential exposure to the Covid-19 virus because they have to deal with Covid-19 patients every day during the pandemic.

Around 34 million people have been infected with COVID-19 virus so far, and nearly 1 million have died as a result of the virus. Resource shortages such as test kits and ventilator have arisen in many countries as the number of cases have increased beyond the control. Therefore, it has become very important to develop deep learning-based applications that automatically detect COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images to assist specialists and radiologists in diagnosis. In this study, we propose a new approach based on deep LSTM model to automatically identify COVID-19 cases from X-ray images. Contrary to the transfer learning and deep feature extraction approaches, the deep LSTM model is an architecture, which is learned from scratch. Besides, the Sobel gradient and marker-controlled watershed segmentation operations are applied to raw images for increasing the performance of proposed model in the pre-processing stage. The experimental studies were performed on a combined public dataset constituted by gathering COVID-19, pneumonia and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. The dataset was randomly separated into two sections as training and testing data. For training and testing, these separations were performed with the rates of 80%C20%, 70%C30% and 60%C40%, respectively. The best performance was achieved with 80% training and 20% testing rate. Moreover, the success rate was 100% for all performance criteria, which composed of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-score. Consequently, the proposed model with pre-processing images ensured promising results on a small dataset compared to big data. Generally, the proposed model can significantly improve the present radiology based approaches and it can be very useful application for radiologists and specialists to help them in detection, quantity determination and tracing of COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic.","output":"DeepCoroNet: A deep LSTM approach for automated detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper contends that sociotherapy, a sociologically informed approach to therapy, is a viable alternative to the diagnostic model recognized by the College of Registered Psychotherapists in Ontario (CRPO).

Hepatitis serology: anti-HBc, HBs-Ag and HBe-Ag positive, anti-HBs and anti-HBe negative, hepatitis A-Ab (IgG) positive, hepatitis A-Ab (IgM) negative, hepatitis C-Ab negative. Pharyngial swab: beta-haemolytic streptococci of group A. Stool examination: amoeba cysts, corona virus and fungi 10(4)-10(5)/ml (control specimen negative). Abdominal sonography showed minor hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and two 0.8 cm-large lymph nodes near the liver entrance. The histology of a skin lesion revealed a florid leukocytoclastic vasculitis at the upper and middle dermal vessels. The immunohistological examination detected IgA, IgM and C3 deposits. TREATMENT AND COURSE The multiple bacterial infections had initially been considered as triggering the Sch?nlein-Henoch purpura. However despite successful treatment of these infections severe relapses of both the skin lesions and the systemic manifestations occurred. A drug reaction, autoimmune diseases and tumours were excluded. Only after treatment of hepatitis B infection with recombinant interferon alpha together with administration of zidovudine (treatment of choice at that time) the lesions quickly disappeared without further relapses. During the 5-year-follow-up, recurrent bacterial infections did not induce relapses of the disease, whereas the hepatitis B infection was seroconverted.

Policy levers, from mask wearing and social distancing to lockdowns and school closures, have been adopted and avoided with equal conviction by decisions makers who believe their measures are appropriate. In some contexts, the global pandemic has been treated with due seriousness by governments and political leaders while in others it has been downplayed to such an extent that it has been framed as a hoax. Every response to the pandemic has produced seemingly zero-sum debates and disputes over the veracity of knowledge bases, while uncertainty reigns as one of the few constants in decision making arenas. While it may be tempting to gravitate to the view that this unimaginable crisis is beyond the capacity of policy scholars to understand, this introductory article sets the scene for dispelling such a notion. It highlights how a number of core policy issues and perspectives, including the politics of problem framing, the limits of an evidence-based approach, and the nature of the public sector, can help bring analytical insights to this unprecedented crisis.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for VAP in children and to create a risk score for developing VAP (RISVAP score). STUDY DESIGN: It was a prospective observational study, including children who required mechanical ventilation (MV), registered in the multicentre ENVIN-HELICS database from 2014 to 2019. The regression coefficients of each independent risk factor for VAP were used to create the RISVAP score. Each factor scored 0 if it was absent, or, if it was present, an assigned value from 1 to 7, according to the regression coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 3798 patients were included, 97(2.5%) developing VAP. The independent risk factors for VAP were: female (odds ratio [OR]: 1.642, p = 0.024), MV > 4 days (OR: 26.79, p < 0.001), length in pediatric intensive care unit > 7 days (OR: 11.74, p < 0.001), and previous colonisation (OR: 4.18, p < 0.001). The RISVAP was calculated for each patient as the sum of all the independent risk factors. Three risk groups were obtained: low (0-5 points), intermediate (6-12 points), and high risk for VAP (13-16 points). The area under the curve for the final score was 0.905 (95%confidence interval: 0.888-0.923, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The RISVAP is the first risk score for VAP in pediatric populations. Using this predictive score, might be helpful to detect vulnerable patients and therefore implement preventative strategies.","output":"RISK score for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in children: The RISVAP study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: With COVID-19 pandemic severely affecting India and Ahmedabad city being one accounting for half COVID cases, objective was to determine disease course and severity of in patients at a COVID care hospital. Design: A Clinical trial registry of India registered observational study (CTRI/2020/05/025247). Setting: Certified COVID hospital located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Participants: 549 COVID positive patients hospitalized between 15 th May to 10 th August, 2020 and treated in ICU and non ICU settings. Main Outcome Measure: Comparative analysis of demographic, clinical characteristics, investigations, treatment, complications and outcome of COVID patients in ICU and non ICU settings. Results: Of the 549 hospitalized COVID positive patients, 159 were admitted in ICU during disease course while 390 had ward admissions. Overall median age was 52 (1-86) years. The ICU group was older (>65years), with associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes (p<0.001); higher proportion of males (79.25%); with dyspnea as a major clinical characteristic and consolidation in lungs as a major radiological finding as compared to ward patients. C - reactive protein, D-Dimer and Ferritin were higher in ICU patients. Overall 50% females depicted elevated Ferritin levels. Steriods(92.45%)and tocilizumab (69.18%) were more frequently used for ICU patients . Remdesivir was prescribed to both ICU and non ICU patients. Favirapir was also a line of treatment for 25% of ICU patients. Convalescent plasma therapy was given to 7 ICU patients. Complications like acute kidney injury (13.84%), shock (10.69 %), sepsis and encephalopathy were observed in ICU patients. Overall mortality rate was 5.47 % with higher mortality among males in comparison to females (p<0.0001). Conclusion: About 29% of overall patients required ICU admission that was commonly elderly males. Chances of ICU admission were higher with baselines comorbidities (1.5 times) and dyspnea (3.4 times) respectively.

While the onset of the pandemic appeared to significantly increase news hunger, soon after, studies reported an uptick in what they termed \\"coronablocking\\": the conscious avoidance of coronavirus related news. Younger age groups in particular appeared more likely to engage in coronablocking. This article seeks to contribute to extant research by providing a textured account of how and why young news users avoid the news. To explore these questions, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews with Belgian news users under the age of 35. We propose that news avoidance practices are fluid, as news avoidance was often preceded by moments of increased news consumption, and inherently connected to the specific spatiotemporal context of users and enacted within their broader media repertoire. In our analysis, we discuss the user-identified characteristics which lead users to a 'tipping point', at which point they avoided the news to varying degrees by reconfiguring their media repertoire. Three types of reconfigurations are identified: tuning out news content, regulating the flow of information, and controlling the tone of voice, all of which underline users' agency in shaping their repertoires to avoid the news.

Diagnostic tools play a pivotal role in warfare against schistosomiasis but must adapt to the endemic status and objectives of activities. With the decrease of prevalence and infection intensity of schistosomiasis in human beings and livestock, optimal methodologies with high sensitivity and absolute specificity are needed for the detection of asymptomatic cases or light infections, as well as disease surveillance to verify elimination. In comparison with the parasitological methods with relatively low sensitivity and serological techniques lacking specificity, which both had been widely used in previous control stages, the molecular detection methods based on the amplification of promising genes of the schistosome genome may pick up the baton to assist the eventual aim of elimination. In this article, we reviewed the developed molecular methods for detecting S. japonicum infection and their application in schistosomiasis japonica diagnosis.

Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short- (g = 0.10, [95% CI -0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g = 0.20, [95% CI -0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior.

The translation of the best fit model yielded two scores composed of 11 criteria: contact with a COVID-19 positive case (+3 points for COVID-19; 0 point for dengue), return from travel abroad within 15 days (+3/-1), previous individual episode of dengue (+1/+3), active smoking (-3/0), body ache (0/+5), cough (0/-2), upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (-1/-1), anosmia (+7/-1), headache (0/+5), retro-orbital pain (-1/+5), and delayed presentation (>3 days) to hospital (+1/0). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.79 (95%CI 0.76-0.82) for COVID-19 score and 0.88 (95%CI 0.85-0.90) for dengue score. Calibration was satisfactory for COVID-19 score and excellent for dengue score. For predicting COVID-19, sensitivity was 97% at the 0-point cut-off and specificity 99% at the 10-point cut-off. For predicting dengue, sensitivity was 97% at the 3-point cut-off and specificity 98% at the 11-point cut-off. ConclusionsThe COVIDENGUE scores proved discriminant to differentiate COVID-19 and dengue from OFIs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 testing center during a co-epidemic.","output":"Differentiating COVID-19 and dengue from other febrile illnesses in co-epidemics: Development and internal validation of COVIDENGUE scores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to outline some considerations about the psychological distress in healthcare professional during the COVID-19 pandemic. We summarize available literature both on protective and predisposing factors potentially involved in the occurrence of psychological distress, including PTSD, in frontline healthcare operators. Valid social support, self-efficacy, internal locus of control (LOC) and sense of coherence (SOC) have been considered as resilience factors, in previous studies. Likewise, several observations pointed on the relevance of individual and environmental vulnerabilities. No real evidence is available about strategies to face the emotional burden for healthcare operators due to present COVID-19 scenario. However, we strongly believe that the containment of isolation anxiety with an appropriate emotional support should be the first instrument to minimise the psychological effect of pandemic on the more exposed healthcare professionals.","output":"Psychological Distress Among Healthcare Professionals Involved in the Covid-19 Emergency: Vulnerability and Resilience Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since their introduction in the early 2000s, the use of social networking websites has exploded.

Commonly regarded as cryptogenic, to date, the etiology is thought to be multifactorial and remains obscure; it is linked either to a direct viral invasion or to an indirect virus-induced prothrombotic state, with or without the presence of conventional cerebrovascular risk factors. In addition, patients are at a greater risk of developing long-term negative sequelae, i.e., long-COVID-related neurological problems, when compared to non-COVID-19 stroke patients. Central to the underlying neurobiology of stroke recovery in the context of COVID-19 infection is reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, which is known to lead to thrombo-inflammation and ACE2/angiotensin-(1C7)/mitochondrial assembly receptor (MasR) (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR) axis inhibition. Moreover, after AIS, the activated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome may heighten the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, mediating neuro-glial cell dysfunction, ultimately leading to nerve-cell death. Therefore, potential neuroprotective therapies targeting the molecular mechanisms of the aforementioned mediators may help to inform rehabilitation strategies to improve brain reorganization (i.e., neuro-gliogenesis and synaptogenesis) and secondary prevention among AIS patients with or without COVID-19. Therefore, this narrative review aims to evaluate the mediating role of the ACE2/Ang- (1-7)/MasR axis and NLRP3 inflammasome in COVID-19-mediated AIS, as well as the prospects of these neuroinflammation mediators for brain repair and in secondary prevention strategies against AIS in stroke rehabilitation.","output":"Neuroinflammation and COVID-19 Ischemic Stroke RecoveryEvolving Evidence for the Mediating Roles of the ACE2/Angiotensin-(1C7)/Mas Receptor Axis and NLRP3 Inflammasome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I examine a novel type of comparative construction in Korean, namely, reduced NP comparatives (RNC), and consider its implications. On the surface, RNC may appear to be a case of the usual NP comparative construction in that two NPs are involved. But, unlike typical NP comparatives, the element bearing the marker of the standard of comparison in RNC does not directly participate in the comparison, i.e., there is a mismatch between the standard and pivot. I argue this is due to the fact that the standard is reduced to leave only the pivot on the surface, hence the name \\"reduced\\" NP comparatives. I also argue that one of the factors that determines the availability of RNC is the notion of comparability, which is based on whether or not the compared elements can be associated with the same scale, where the scale is part of the semantics of the gradable predicate (Cf. Kennedy 2009). The interesting twist is that RNC is possible only if the relevant elements are not comparable with each other, i.e., they should denote different types of objects that cannot be associated with the same scale.

Three patients for bilateral axillary osmidrosis were enrolled. After an incision of about one-third the length of the widest transverse diameter, the apocrine glands were separated from the skin. And then apocrine glands within the marked area were destroyed by irradiation with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser thereafter. All patients exhibited no relapse of axillary osmidrosis and were satisfied with the treatment results.

METHODS: Adult respondents (n = 8130) in a nationally representative prospective longitudinal study completed 21 biweekly web surveys (March 2020 to January 2021). Past-week alcohol drinking frequency (drinking days [range: 0 to 7]) and intensity (binge drinking on usual past-week drinking day [yes/no]) were assessed at each timepoint. Growth mixture models identified multiple subpopulations with homogenous drinking trajectories based on mean drinking days or binge drinking proportional probabilities across time. RESULTS: Four drinking frequency trajectories were identified: Minimal/stable (72.8% [95% CI = 71.8 to 73.8]) with <1 mean past-week drinking days throughout; Moderate/late decreasing (6.7% [95% CI = 6.2 to 7.3) with 3.13 mean March drinking days and reductions during summer, reaching 2.12 days by January 2021; Moderate/early increasing (12.9% [95% CI = 12.2 to 13.6) with 2.13 mean March drinking days that increased in April and then plateaued, ending with 3.20 mean days in January 2021; and Near daily/early increasing (7.6% [95% CI = 7.0 to 8.2]) with 5.58 mean March drinking days that continued increasing without returning to baseline.

DESIGN/SETTING: During March-June 2020, 502 workers at a Utah meat-processing facility (facility A) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using merged data from the state disease surveillance system and facility A, we analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and worker demographics, work section, and geospatial data on worker residence. We analyzed worker survey responses to questions regarding COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors at work and home. PARTICIPANTS: (1) Facility A workers (n = 1373) with specimen collection dates and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; (2) residential addresses of all persons (workers and nonworkers) with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test (n = 1036), living within the 3 counties included in the health department catchment area; and (3) facility A workers (n = 64) who agreed to participate in the knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: New cases over time, COVID-19 attack rates, worker characteristics by SARS-CoV-2 test results, geospatially clustered cases, space-time proximity of cases among workers and nonworkers; frequency of quantitative responses, crude prevalence ratios, and counts and frequency of coded responses to open-ended questions from the COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in race (P = .01), linguistic group (P < .001), and work section (P < .001) were found between workers with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Geographically, only 6% of cases were within statistically significant spatiotemporal case clusters. Workers reported using handwashing (57%) and social distancing (21%) as mitigation strategies outside work but reported apprehension with taking COVID-19-associated sick leave.

Despite their benefits for screening, the cost of large-scale implementation is largely understudied. Our study presents evidence on their implementation costs in high-risk settings. This study aimed to estimate the economic costs of implementing Ag-RDT-based screening for SARS-CoV-2 in two tertiary care hospitals (University Hospital Heidelberg - UKHD, and Charit C Universit?tsmedizin Berlin) and one nursing home in Germany. METHODS: We adopted a health system perspective and followed the three sequential steps to costing: identification of resources, measurement of resource consumption, and valuation of costs. Data on resource consumption were collected between October 2020 and April 2021 through various techniques and data sources. The cost estimation considered all costs along the screening algorithm including PCR confirmation tests for positive cases. We estimated the costs for the two implementation modalities observed: staff dedicated exclusively to screening and staff not dedicated exclusively to screening. Furthermore, cost estimations were performed under both observed capacity use and hypothetical capacity use assumptions (60, 80 and 100%). RESULTS: Our study indicates that the average cost per Ag-RDT is highly dependent on the capacity use and implementation mode. Staff time and test kits are the two main cost drivers of implementing the large-scale screening programs for SARS-CoV-2 using Ag-RDTs. For hospitals, the average cost per test in UKHD was 30.12 (capacity observed); 14.56 (non-dedicated mode); 19.47, 16.37, 14.53 at 60, 80, 100% capacity respectively (dedicated mode); and at Charit 13.10 (non-dedicated mode). For the nursing home the estimated average cost per test was 15.03 (non-dedicated mode). CONCLUSIONS: The information on the estimated costs by mode of implementation and capacity use may support the planning of Ag-RDT-based covid-19 screening programs suitable for each institution.

This study aimed to assess the proportion and outcome of IOL among mothers who delivered in Teaching Hospital, southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10 to June 20, 2019, among 294 mothers who gave birth between November 30, 2018, and May 30, 2019, by reviewing their cards using a structured checklist to assess the prevalence, outcome, and consequences of induction of labor. A binary logistic regression analysis was computed to look for the association between outcome variables and independent variables. Results: The prevalence of labor induction was 20.4%. The most commonly reported cause of induction was preeclampsia (41.6%). The factors associated with IOL were mothers aged 25-34 years [AOR = 2.55, 95% CI (1.18-5.50)] and 35 years [AOR = 10.6, 95% CI (4.20-26.9)], having no history of antenatal care [AOR = 2.12, 95% CI (1.10-4.07)], and being Primipara AOR = 2.33, 95% CI (1.18-3.24)]. Of the 60 induced mothers, 23.3% had failed induction. The proportion of mothers with dead fetal outcomes and maternal complications was 5 and 41.7%, respectively.

Conclusion: The prevalence of induced labor was considerably higher than rates in other Ethiopian studies; however, the prevalence of induction failure was comparable to other studies done in Ethiopia. The study found that Bishop's unfavorable score before induction and induction using misoprostol was the factor associated with unsuccessful induction.

Research has shown that ASIC channels are involved in the proliferation and growth of cancer cells; therefore, Mambalgin-1 can be a potential anti-cancer by inhibiting these channels. In the present study, the Nicotiana benthamiana codon optimized Mambalgin-1 gene was synthesized and cloned in PVX (potato virus X) viral vector. The two cultures of Agrobacterium containing Mambalgin-1 and P19 silencing suppressor genes were co-agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Five days post infiltration, the production of recombinant Mambalgin-1 was determined by western blotting. For biological activity, MTT (3(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was analyzed for the cytotoxicity recombinant Mambalgin-1 from the transformed plants on nervous (SH-SY5Y) and breast (MCF7) cancer cells. The results showed that the plants expressing open reading frame of Mambalgin-1 showed recombinant 7.4 kDa proteins in the entire plant extract. In the MTT test, it was found that Mambalgin-1 had cytotoxic effects on SH-SY5Y cancer cells, yet no effects on MCF7 cancer cells were observed.

Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi? 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). Results A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusions Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation.

METHODS: The study admitted 285 patients with confirmed EVD and followed them up till the endpoint (recovery or death). EVD was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR assays detecting blood Ebola virus (EBOV). RESULTS: Among the 285 lab-confirmed EVD cases in Jui Government Hospital, 146 recovered and 139 died, with an overall survival rate of 51.23 %. Patients under the age of 6 years had a lower survival rate (37.50 %). Most non-survivors (79.86 %) died within 7 days after admission and the mean hospitalization time for non-survivors was 5.56  6.11 days. More than half survivors (63.69 %) turned blood EBOV negative within 3 weeks after admission and the mean hospitalization time for survivors was 20.38  7.58 days. High blood viral load (10(6) copies/ml) was found to be predictive of the non-survival outcome as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The probability of patients survival was less than 15 % when blood viral load was greater than 10(6) copies/ml. Multivariate analyses showed that blood viral load (P = 0.005), confusion (P = 0.010), abdominal pain (P = 0.003), conjunctivitis (P = 0.035), and vomiting (P = 0.004) were factors independently associated with the outcomes of EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most death occurred within 1 week after admission, and patients at the age of 6 or younger had a lower survival rate.

In order to cope with green analytical chemistry principles and the trending development of miniaturized portable and handheld devices, an innovative microfabricated ion-selective electrode for the analysis of metoclopramide (MTP) was developed. The fabricated electrode adopted a two-step optimization process. The first step of optimization depended on screening different ionophores in order to enhance the sensor selectivity. Calix-4-arene showed the maximal selectivity towards MTP. The second step was utilizing a graphene nanocomposite as an ion-to-electron transducer layer between the calix-4-arene polymeric membrane and the microfabricated copper solid-contact ion-selective electrode. The graphene nanocomposite layer added more stability to electrode potential drift and short response times (10 s), probably due to the hydrophobic behavior of the graphene nanocomposite, which precludes the formation of a water layer at the Cu electrode/polymeric membrane interface. The proposed MTP sensor has been characterized according to IUPAC recommendations and the linear dynamic range estimated to be 1  10-6 to 1  10-2 M with LOD of 3  10-7 M.

Clinical decision support (CDS) is critically important to chronic care providers, and CDS malfunction is common during times of change. It is essential to regularly reassess an organization's ambulatory CDS program to maintain care quality. This is especially true after an immense change, like the COVID-19 telemedicine expansion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to reassess the ambulatory CDS program at a large academic medical center in light of telemedicine's expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Our clinical informatics team devised a practical framework for an intrapandemic ambulatory CDS assessment focused on the impact of the telemedicine expansion. This assessment began with a quantitative analysis comparing CDS alert performance in the context of in-person and telemedicine visits. Board-certified physician informaticists then completed a formal workflow review of alerts with inferior performance in telemedicine visits. Informaticists then reported on themes and optimization opportunities through the existing CDS governance structure. RESULTS: Our assessment revealed that 10 of our top 40 alerts by volume were not firing as expected in telemedicine visits. In 3 of the top 5 alerts, providers were significantly less likely to take action in telemedicine when compared to office visits. Cumulatively, alerts in telemedicine encounters had an action taken rate of 5.3% (3257/64,938) compared to 8.3% (19,427/233,636) for office visits. Observations from a clinical informaticist workflow review included the following: (1) Telemedicine visits have different workflows than office visits. Some alerts developed for the office were not appearing at the optimal time in the telemedicine workflow. (2) Missing clinical data is a common reason for the decreased alert firing seen in telemedicine visits. (3) Remote patient monitoring and patient-reported clinical data entered through the portal could replace data collection usually completed in the office by a medical assistant or registered nurse.

Growing evidence suggests that individuals with the pre-existing conditions of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity are at a higher risk of more serious COVID-19 illness. However, the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait as compared to those without sickle cell disease or trait is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of hospitalization, disease symptoms and deaths due to COVID-19, in patients with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait compared to Blacks without sickle cell disease or trait. Methods: We leveraged existing electronic health record (EHR) data from multiple sites that contribute data to a research network, TriNetX. TriNetX query platform was used to identify patients with COVID-19 infection based on ICD diagnoses codes or a positive COVID-19 result from a nucleic acid amplification with probe-based detection test, present any time after January 20, 2020 (this is when the first COVID-19 case was detected in the United States) within the patients EHR data. We report rates of specific COVID-19 related outcomes among individuals with sickle cell disease and trait, calculated as % of patients in cohort with the particular outcome. Our outcomes of interest included COVD-19 related symptoms, hospitalization, and death, which occurred within 2 weeks of COVID diagnosis. We used propensity score matching (greedy nearest-neighbor matching algorithm with a caliper of 0.1 pooled standard deviations) to create balanced cohorts for comparing outcomes between individuals with sickle cell disease or trait and Blacks without sickle cell disease or trait. Risk ratios and risk differences are reported along with 95% confidence intervals. Given multiple outcomes of interest, we considered a more stringent two-sided alpha of less than <0.01, based on a z-test, to determine statistical significance for differences in outcome rates. Results: As of July 15, 2020, there were 122 COVID-19 patients who had sickle cell disease and 172 COVID-19 patients who had sickle cell trait. Our comparator groups included 15,762 Blacks who were diagnosed with COVID-19 but did not have sickle cell trait/disease. COVID-19 patients with sickle cell disease were significantly younger and a higher proportion had asthma, type 1 diabetes and pre-existing liver conditions compared to Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease (Table 1). COVID-19 patients with sickle cell trait were significantly younger, a higher proportion were females, overweight/obese, and a higher proportion had asthma or type 1 diabetes compared to Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease (Table 1). The rate of respective outcomes for the three groups is shown in Figure 1. Propensity score matching yielded a cohort of patients such that there were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with sickle cell disease/trait compared to Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease. After matching, COVID patients with sickle cell disease remained at a higher risk of hospitalization, pneumonia and pain compared to Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease (Table 2). The case fatality rates were not significantly different between those with sickle cell disease compared to Blacks. There were no significant differences in COVID outcomes between sickle cell trait and Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease, within the matched cohort. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that sickle cell disease imposes additional risk of severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization, after balancing for age, gender and other preexisting conditions. The death rate between sickle cell disease and Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease was not significantly different. There are no significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes between sickle cell trait and Blacks without sickle cell trait/disease, after balancing for age, gender and other pre-existing conditions.

This paper, based on research interviews with participants who live or have lived in the Falklands, examines the links between COVID-19 responses, resilience and social control, in what have been some of the most challenging times for the Islands since the conflict with Argentina 40 years ago. We found that there are a number of factors particular to Island communities that have helped the Falkland Islanders to cope well with the strictures of the pandemic.","output":"Small Islands, resilience and social control: how the Falkland Islands handled COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common disease that significantly increases the risk of strokes. Oral anticoagulants represent the standard preventive treatment, but they involve severe drawbacks, including intracerebral bleedings. Since in patients affected by nonvalvular AF, the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) is the primary source of thromboembolism, percutaneous closure of the LAA is a viable option for people unsuitable for long-term anticoagulant therapy. However, the complexities related to the implant procedure, occlusion devices and the anatomical variability hinder the pre-operative planning, resulting in unexpected outcomes. In this context, in-silico models may represent a powerful support tool providing clinicians with more detailed information. Nevertheless, few works focusing on numerical modeling of LAA occlusion devices have been presented so far, and a detailed process to assess the model credibility, verifying that different sources of uncertainty did not affect the prediction, is missing. This work aims to illustrate a process that allows to build and validate the numerical model of a commercial occlusion device starting from only one sample available and without data provided by the manufacturer. To better identify potential uncertainties, the validation followed a step-by-step process that led from individual device behavior assessment to interaction with deformable conduit evaluation.","output":"Left atrial appendage occlusion device: Development and validation of a finite element model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It is uniformly accepted that the current COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented strain on all facets of life around the world This is especially true for both healthcare workers and patients who have been significantly affected Our aim was to objectively quantify how this pandemic particularly affected the stress levels of healthcare workers (HCW) METHODS: The Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) is a psychological instrument used to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful The CPSS has been used in studies exploring perceived self-helplessness and self-efficacy Over the course of 2 weeks, ICU HCW: medical doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, patient care assistants, and pharmacists;were asked to complete the CPSS survey that was sent via email The department leaders, via email, reminded HCW to complete the survey once A total of 144 HCW responded A comparison of the results was conducted based on profession, gender, and years of work experience RESULTS: The results range between 11 9-14 7 indicating significant levels of stress in HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic We analyzed the data collected using analysis of variance to determine the P-Value When the scores were organized by the three categories of profession, gender, and years of work experience, we found no significant difference (P&lt;0 05) in the quantitative level of stress reported CONCLUSIONS: The results of the survey confirm significant levels of stress reported by all participants There is no significant difference in stress levels between professions, gender, or years of work experience We propose that stress reduction management should be implemented for all HCW Furthermore, the survey should be repeated once stress mitigation techniques are used to objectify reduction in stress levels Finally, we intend to repeat the survey once the pandemic has ended to evaluate baseline stress levels in non-pandemic situations This study is limited by respondent bias in a pandemic situation There was no baseline assessment of stress levels for comparison Conducting this type of survey at the end of the pandemic, in non-pandemic situation, and on a yearly basis would better quantify the levels of stress in ICU HCW","output":"COVID-19-related perceived stress in healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide health crisis declared in 2020 due to the new coronavirus, besides the serious social and economic consequences, has also impacted the way governments communicate with their citizens.

A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events.

Recently, long non-coding RNAs, like HOXA-AS3, have been reported to regulate chemoresistance in several types of cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine whether HOXA-AS3 can mediate cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer, and its potential mechanism of action. We determined the viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells using a CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, and flow cytometry, respectively. We used western blot analysis to assess the expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Notch1. We then confirmed expression of these EMT-related markers by immunofluorescence analysis. We found that hypoxia promoted resistance to cisplatin and upregulated the level of HOXA-AS3 in BC cells. Inhibition of HOXA-AS3 enhanced hypoxia-induced cisplatin sensitivity by regulating EMT and Notch1 in BC cells. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that HOXA-AS3 directly targets miR-455-5p and that Notch1 was a potential target of miRNA-455-5p. We also found that the positive effect of HOXA-AS3 inhibition on cisplatin resistance and tumorigenesis was alleviated when BC cells were transfected with miR-455-5p. Finally, we showed combining HOXA-AS3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) with cisplatin treatment inhibited tumorigenesis in a BALB/c nu/nu mouse model. Our findings indicate that HOXA-AS3 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-455-5p to regulate Notch1 and play an important role in regulating chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in BC cells.

Adoption of drought-tolerant rice varieties can play an important role in increasing productivity, food grain supply, and income. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have measured the welfare impacts of drought-tolerant rice varieties in the South Asian and Bangladeshi context. Therefore, this study identifies the factors that influence the intensity of adoption and welfare impacts of drought-tolerant rice varieties in Bangladesh. To accomplish these objectives, 300 rice growers from three drought-prone districts of Bangladesh were surveyed. To analyze the impacts, the entire sample was divided into three groups depending on their share of land under drought-tolerant rice variety cultivation: full adopters, partial adopters, and non-adopters. The descriptive statistics, two-limit Tobit model and multivalued treatment effect models were used to analyze the data. According to the findings, training as well as technology-related factors play a major role in boosting the intensity of adoption. Full adopters of drought-tolerant varieties receive 1222C1473 kg higher yield per hectare compared to non-adopters.

The biological function of HMGB1 depends on its subcellular localization and expression. It plays a critical role in the nucleus and cytoplasm as DNA chaperone, chromosome gatekeeper, autophagy maintainer, and protector from apoptotic cell death. HMGB1 also functions as an extracellular alarmin acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP).

The purpose of this study was to assess how Level II sleep studies (LII, full PSG in the home) might be utilized in diagnostic algorithms of suspected OSA using a theoretical decision model. METHODS: We examined four diagnostic algorithms for suspected OSA: an initial PSG approach, an initial LII approach, an initial Level III approach (LIII, limited channel home sleep study) followed by PSG if needed, and an initial LIII approach followed by LII if needed. Costs per patient assessed was calculated as a function of pretest OSA probability and a variety of other variables (e.g. costs of tests, failure rate of LIII/LII, sensitivity/specificity of LIII). The situation in British Columbia was used as a case study. RESULTS: The variation in cost per test was calculated for each algorithm as a function of the above variables. For British Columbia, initial LII was the least costly across a broad range of pretest OSA probabilities (< 0.80) while initial LIII followed by LII as needed was least costly at very high pretest probability (> 0.8). In patients with a pretest OSA probability of 0.5, costs per patient for initial PSG, initial LII, initial LIII followed by PSG, and initial LIII followed by LII were: $588, $417, $607, and $481 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using a theoretical decision model, we developed a preliminary cost framework to assess the potential role of LII studies in OSA assessment. Across a broad range of patient pretest probabilities, initial LII studies may provide substantial cost advantages. LII studies might be especially useful during pandemics as they combine the extensive physiologic information characteristic of PSG with the ability to avoid in-laboratory stays.

METHODS: Using longitudinal data from the HIVE cohort from 2010C11 through 2017C18, we estimated direct, indirect, and total influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the incidence rate ratio of influenza virus infection using adjusted mixed-effect Poisson regression models. Total effectiveness was determined through comparison of vaccinated members of full or partially vaccinated households to unvaccinated individuals in completely unvaccinated households. RESULTS: The pooled, direct VE against any influenza was 30.2% (14.0C43.4). Direct VE was higher for influenza A/H1N1 43.9% (3.9 to 63.5) and B 46.7% (17.2 to 57.5) than A/H3N2 31.7% (10.5 to 47.8) and was higher for young children 42.4% (10.1 to 63.0) than adults 18.6% (?6.3 to 37.7).

In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that a strong reliance on contact tracing to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can lead to the potential danger of allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked. A carefully thought out strategy for controlling the spread of the pandemic along with automated contact tracing can lead to an optimal solution.","output":"Contact Tracing: a game of big numbers in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes, a class of small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm), are secreted by almost all types of cells into virtually all body fluids. These small vesicles are attracting increasing research attention owing to their potential for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, their inherent heterogeneity and the complexity of bio-fluids pose significant challenges for their isolation. Even the \\"gold standard,\\" differential centrifugation, suffers from poor yields and is time-consuming. In this context, recent developments in microfluidic technologies have provided an ideal system for exosome extraction and these devices exhibit some fascinating properties such as high speeds, good portability, and low sample volumes. In this review, the focus is on the state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies for exosome isolation and highlight potential directions for future research and development by analyzing the challenges faced by the current strategies.","output":"A Holistic Review of the State-of-the-Art Microfluidics for Exosome Separation: An Overview of the Current Status, Existing Obstacles, and Future Outlook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of blindness, ectopic pregnancy, and bacterial sexually transmitted infections. These diseases affect mostly young women but can also infect men and women of all ages. It is not difficult to treat, but it can lead to more significant health problems if left untreated. There is no licensed vaccine available for this pathogen at present. Hence, a vaccine that can control and prevent C. trachomatis infections is designed in this study by using different immuno-informatics approaches. However, the designed vaccine is the result of computational approaches; therefore, experimental validation is required to prove its effectiveness. ABSTRACT: Chlamydia trachomatis, a Gram-negative bacterium that infects the rectum, urethra, congenital sites, and columnar epithelium of the cervix. It is a major cause of preventable blindness, ectopic pregnancy, and bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide. There is currently no licensed multi-epitope vaccination available for this pathogen. This study used core proteomics, immuno-informatics, and subtractive proteomics approaches to identify the best antigenic candidates for the development of a multi-epitope-based vaccine (MEBV). These approaches resulted in six vaccine candidates: Type III secretion system translocon subunit CopD2, SctW family type III secretion system gatekeeper subunit CopN, SycD/LcrH family type III secretion system chaperone Scc2, CT847 family type III secretion system effector, hypothetical protein CTDEC_0668, and CHLPN 76kDa-like protein. A variety of immuno-informatics tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes from vaccine candidate proteins. An in silico vaccine was developed using carefully selected epitopes (11 CTL, 2 HTL & 10 LBL) and then docked with the MHC molecules (MHC I & MHC II) and human TLR4. The vaccine was coupled with Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) adjuvant to boost the immune response. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular docking, and MMGBSA analysis were carried out to analyze the molecular interactions and binding affinity of MEBV with TLR4 and MHC molecules. To achieve the highest level of vaccine protein expression, the MEBV was cloned and reverse-translated in Escherichia coli. The highest level of expression was achieved, and a CAI score of 0.97 was reported. Further experimental validation of the MEBV is required to prove its efficacy. The vaccine developed will be useful in preventing infections caused by C. trachomatis.","output":"Designing a Multi-Epitope Vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis by Employing Integrated Core Proteomics, Immuno-Informatics and In Silico Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of infectious diseases arises from complex interactions between disease dynamics and human behavior. Predicting the outcome of this complex system is difficult. Consequently, there has been a recent emphasis on comparing the relative risks of different policy options rather than precise predictions. Here, one performs a parameter sweep to generate a large number of possible scenarios for human behavior under different policy options and identifies the relative risks of different decisions regarding policy or design choices. In particular, this approach has been used to identify effective approaches to social distancing in crowded locations, with pedestrian dynamics used to simulate the movement of individuals. This incurs a large computational load, though. The traditional approach of optimizing the implementation of existing mathematical models on parallel systems leads to a moderate improvement in computational performance. In contrast, we show that when dealing with human behavior, we can create a model from scratch that takes computer architectural features into account, yielding much higher performance without requiring complicated parallelization efforts. Our solution is based on two key observations. (i) Models do not capture human behavior as precisely as models for scientific phenomena describe natural processes. Consequently, there is some leeway in designing a model to suit the computational architecture. (ii) The result of a parameter sweep, rather than a single simulation, is the semantically meaningful result. Our model leverages these features to perform efficiently on CPUs and GPUs. We obtain a speedup factor of around 60 using this new model on two Xeon Platinum 8280 CPUs and a factor 125 speedup on 4 NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs over a parallel implementation of the existing model. The careful design of a GPU implementation makes it fast enough for real-time decision-making. We illustrate it on an application to COVID-19.","output":"Architecture-Aware Modeling of Pedestrian Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past few years, big data related to healthcare has become more important, due to the abundance of data, the increasing cost of healthcare, and the privacy of healthcare.

The impact of these interventions on trauma and emergency general surgery patient volume has not yet been described. METHODS: We compared trauma admissions and emergency general surgery (EGS) cases between February 1CApril 14 from 2017C2020 in five two-week time periods. Data were compared across time periods with Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in overall trauma admissions (57.4% decrease, p<0.001); motor vehicle collisions (MVC) (80.5% decrease, p<0.001); and non-MVCs (45.1% decrease, p<0.001) from FebruaryCApril 2020. We found no significant change in EGS cases (p = 0.70). Nor was there was a significant change in trauma cases in any other year 2017C2019.
